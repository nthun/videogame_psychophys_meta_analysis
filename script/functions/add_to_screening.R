#' Adds new articles to ongoing screening process
#'
#' Add new literature to the existing and work-in-progress files and return an updated df. It preserves all previous screening effort, so no manual coding is lost.
#' @name add_to_screening
#' @usage add_to_screening(old_article_df, new_article_df, team_df, seed = 1)
#' @param old_article_df df that contains all work-in-progress data, retrieved by get_screening_sheets()
#' @param new_article_df a df that contains new articles, and has only one identifier
#' @param team_df data frame describing the team that contains name<chr>, and screening_effort<int> variables to be used when assigning the new articles
#' @param seed random seed to use to make the assignment reproducible
#' @return A data frame containing nested data frames for each revier with updated data

# Possible bug!
# The old df contains the records in duplicate for a reason, so not all duplicates should be removed
