,[Evaluation Of The Characteristics Of Addiction To Online Video Games Among Adolescents And Young Adults].,"The objectives of this study are to assess the social characteristics, coping strategies, self-esteem and depressive symptoms in a population-dependent and not dependent on video games online, in order to investigate the correlations existing between these characteristics. The study was conducted among 193 subjects. Data were collected through a global questionnaire constituted of several scales. The global questionnaire consisted of a sociodemographic part (age, sex, social status, most played game, number of hours per week devoted to the game), a questionnaire assessing dependence and abuse according to the DSM -IV-TR, the feeling of social belonging scale (or ESAS which was doubled to collect information about the belonging in real life and virtual life), the Ways of coping check-list (WCCL), the Rosenberg self-esteem scale (EES), the Quality of interpersonal relations scale (EQRI), the UCLA Loneliness scale and the Center for epidemiologic studies depression scale (CES-D). The questionnaire was broadcasted on the Internet, specifically in the forums dedicated to ""massively multiplayer online role-playing games"" and in young people's forums in specific subject headings. The results show that there are significant differences between the two populations, especially regarding the social characteristics, depressive symptoms, self-esteem and coping strategies. In the entire population, 66 subjects (42%) were considered dependent on online video games and 92 subjects (58%) were not considered dependent. In the dependent population, the number of hours spent playing per week, the score of social belonging in the virtual life, the coping focused on the emotion, the score of loneliness or social isolation and the score obtained on the CES-D appeared more important than the scores obtained by the non-dependent. Moreover, the average age, the scores of social belonging in real life, self-esteem and sub-dimensions ""family"" and ""friends"" of the quality of interpersonal relations scale are lower than those obtained by the non-dependent. Furthermore, the number of hours of play per week, the feeling of social belonging, self-esteem, quality of family relationships and loneliness are predictive factors of addiction to video games online. These results suggest that one of the crucial issues in dependence is the monitoring of game practice. Indeed, dependence on video games is based on a real hardware that needs to be controlled and managed by a third party before the emergence of a dependency. Therefore the results of this study suggest the establishment of better prevention, especially among parents who are confronted in majority with a world and a technology that is unknown or too complicated. In the case of a proven addiction, the study proposes care therapy focused on the social link, especially the family link, and a particular care to work on self-esteem.",doi,10.1016/j.encep.2010.06.006,pubmed,L'Encephale,"Schmit, S; Chauchard, E; Chabrol, H; Sejourne, N",2012,NA,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,"“Beauty Sleeping In The Lap Of Horror”: Landscape Aesthetics And Gothic Pleasures, From The Castle Of Otranto To Video Games","In the latter part of the eighteenth century a new enthusiasm-a new way of looking at the physical world-swept through England. This new landscape aesthetic was generally expressed in terms of the closely interrelated concepts of the sublime, the beautiful, and the picturesque. As a system of artistic, psychological, and philosophical references, the aesthetic fired the imaginations of many eighteenth-century British novelists, especially those who were turning their attention to a then-emerging fictional form, the Gothic novel. The ideas encompassed by this system of landscape aesthetics were perfect vehicles for these eighteenth-century stories of suspense and terror; and during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, this adaptable aesthetic continued to provide a common reference point for creators and readers of Gothic fiction. Even today, although we may not use the same terminology, landscape aesthetics based on the sublime, the beautiful, and the picturesque are still alive and well in popular culture. Many modern-day writers and artists who work in the Gothic tradition-from novelists to film makers to video game designers-continue to draw from the same aesthetic conventions. The plot constructs that thrill today’s audiences (attacks by space aliens; love stories of teenage vampires) differ from the constructs used by eighteenth-century authors (menacing, ghostly figures; terrified virgins fleeing would-be seducers). Nevertheless, the complex emotions-apprehension and terror, anticipation and pleasure-evoked by the best Gothic fictions have remained remarkably consistent.1 This chapter shows how some of the best-respected practitioners of Gothic have, over the years, used specific elements of an eighteenth-century aesthetic canon to produce specific emotional responses in their audience-that is, to produce the range of feelings that comprise the “delicious terror” of the true Gothic experience. © The Author(s) 2016.",doi,10.1007/978-3-319-33165-2_4,Scopus,"Gothic Landscapes: Changing Eras, Changing Cultures, Changing Anxieties",Davenport A.,2016,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,A Collusion-Resistant Mechanism For Autonomic Resource Management In Virtual Private Networks,"In this paper, we address the problem of autonomic resource management for Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Resources management is one of the important problems facing most Internet Service Providers (ISPs). As a solution, the Autonomic Service Architecture (ASA) is proposed in the literature to automate the resources management. Although, this model is able to improve ISPs' performance by automatically adjusting the resources allocation of each customer, it still suffers from two main limitations. First, this model increases the ISPs' revenue in a suboptimal way. Second, this model has no mechanism to prevent customers' exaggeration that can lead to a non-efficient resource utilization, and violate the contracted Service Level Agreements' (SLAs) terms. To guarantee their QoS classes; customers might exaggerate by asking for more resources during and after the SLA negotiation session, especially in the case of multimedia streaming, and this can waste the available network resources. To overcome the above limitations, we propose an Autonomic Resources Management Mechanism (ARMM) that increases the ISPs' revenue by allocating resources based on the auction mechanism, where resources are granted to the best bidders. Additionally, we propose a threat model based on Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism that is able to penalize exaggerating bidders according to the created inconvenience. Since in our framework, customers are assumed to be rational, they will avoid asking for more unneeded resources but they can collude with others to have the resources for less. Such a behavior can dramatically minimize the ISP revenue while on the other hand it can maximize the customers' utility. To avoid this, we propose a collusion resistant model based on the Markov Decision Process (MDP) that allows the ISP to calculate the state-dependent optimal cost-unit threshold based on the shadow price concept. All bids that are greater than or equal this threshold are considered in the auction. With this threshold, we can reduce the collusion behavior and with VCG we can motivate the customers to not exaggerate. Simulation results show that the ARMM model is able to efficiently utilize network resources, increase ISPs' profit, and customers' satisfaction rates. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

,A Comparison Of Additional Heart Rates During Active Psychological Challenge Calculated From Upper Body And Lower Body Dynamic Exercise,"Heart rate, oxygen consumption, and blood pressure were recorded while 22 young males performed a stressful mental arithmetic task and played a video game. Measurements were also made while subjects undertook two separate graded dynamic exercise tasks, an upper body and a lower body task. All measures changed as a function of psychological challenge, and during exercise heart rate and oxygen consumption changed as an orderly function of workload. For each subject, heart rate was plotted against oxygen consumption over the various workloads for each exercise task separately, thereby generating two regression lines per subject. In conjunction with oxygen consumption values during the psychological tasks, these regressions allowed the prediction of expected heart rate values during psychological challenge, and thus the computation of additional heart rate as the difference between actual heart rate and predicted heart rate. Actual heart rate during psychological challenge was substantially greater than predicted heart rate, i.e., there was considerable additional heart rate. This was the case irrespective of whether upper or lower body exercise was used to compute the predictions, and there was no significant difference between the additional heart rates generated from the two exercise tasks, which produced regression lines with similar slope and intercept values.

,A Distributed Admission Control Model For Qos Assurance In Large-Scale Media Delivery Systems,"Conventional admission control models incur some performance penalty. First, admission control computation can overload a server that is already heavily loaded. Also, in large-scale media systems with geographically distributed server clusters, performing admission control on each cluster can result in long response latency, if the client request is denied at one site and has to be forwarded to another site. Furthermore, in prefix caching, initial frames cached at the proxy are delivered to the client before the admission decisions are made. If the media server is heavily loaded and, finally, has to deny the client request, forwarding a large number of initial frames is a waste of critical network resources. In this paper, a novel distributed admission control model is presented. We make use of proxy servers to perform the admission control tasks. Each proxy hosts an agent to coordinate the effort. Agents reserve media server's disk bandwidth and make admission decisions autonomously based on the allocated disk bandwidth. We develop an effective game theoretic framework to achieve fairness in the bandwidth allocation among the agents. To improve the overall bandwidth utilization, we also consider an aggressive admission control policy where each agent may admit more requests than its allocated bandwidth allows. The distributed admission control approach provides the solution to the stated problems incurred in conventional admission control models. Experimental studies show that our algorithms significantly reduce the responce latency and the media server load. © 2005 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TPDS.2005.141,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,"Xia Z., Hao W., Yen I.-L., Li P.",2005,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,A Fuzzy-Rule-Based Driving Architecture For Non-Player Characters In A Car Racing Game,"Videogame-based competitions have been the target of considerable interest among researchers over the past few years since they provide an ideal framework in which to apply soft computing techniques. One of the most popular competitions is the Simulated Car Racing Competition which, thanks to the realism implemented by recent car simulators, provides an excellent test bed for the application of autonomous driving techniques. The present work describes the design and implementation of a car controller able to deal with competitive racing situations. The complete driving architecture consists of six simple modules, each one responsible for a basic aspect of car driving. Three modules use simple functions to control gear shifting, steering movements, and pedal positions. A fourth manages speed control by means of a simple fuzzy system. The other two modules are in charge of (i) adapting the driving behaviour to the presence of other cars, and (ii) implementing a basic 'inter-lap' learning mechanism in order to remember key track segments and adapt the speed accordingly in future laps. The controller was evaluated in two ways. First, in runs without adversaries over several track designs, our controller allowed some of the longest distances to be covered in a set time in comparison with data from other previous controllers, and second, as a participant in the 2009 Simulated Car Racing Competition which it ended up winning. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",doi,10.1007/s00500-011-0691-6,Scopus,Soft Computing,"Onieva E., Pelta D.A., Milanés V., Pérez J.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,A Human-Machine-Interface Integrating Low-Cost Sensors With A Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation System For Post-Stroke Balance Rehabilitation,"A stroke is caused when an artery carrying blood from heart to an area in the brain bursts or a clot obstructs the blood flow to brain thereby preventing delivery of oxygen and nutrients. About half of the stroke survivors are left with some degree of disability. Innovative methodologies for restorative neurorehabilitation are urgently required to reduce long-term disability. The ability of the nervous system to reorganize its structure, function and connections as a response to intrinsic or extrinsic stimuli is called neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity is involved in post-stroke functional disturbances, but also in rehabilitation. Beneficial neuroplastic changes may be facilitated with non-invasive electrotherapy, such as neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) and sensory electrical stimulation (SES). NMES involves coordinated electrical stimulation of motor nerves and muscles to activate them with continuous short pulses of electrical current while SES involves stimulation of sensory nerves with electrical current resulting in sensations that vary from barely perceivable to highly unpleasant. Here, active cortical participation in rehabilitation procedures may be facilitated by driving the non-invasive electrotherapy with biosignals (electromyogram (EMG), electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculogram (EOG)) that represent simultaneous active perception and volitional effort. To achieve this in a resource-poor setting, e.g., in low- and middle-income countries, we present a low-cost human-machine-interface (HMI) by leveraging recent advances in off-the-shelf video game sensor technology. In this paper, we discuss the open-source software interface that integrates low-cost off-the-shelf sensors for visual- auditory biofeedback with non-invasive electrotherapy to assist postural control during balance rehabilitation. We demonstrate the proof-of- concept on healthy volunteers. © 2016 Journal of Visualized Experiments.",doi,10.3791/52394,Scopus,Journal of Visualized Experiments,"Kumar D., Das A., Lahiri U., Dutta A.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,A Missed Penalty Kick Triggered Coronary Death In The Husband And Broken Heart Syndrome In The Wife,"Events that induce emotional stress and frustration in a large number of subjects under specific circumstances, such as earthquakes, war conditions, and sporting occasions, may increase the incidence of cardiovascular events, such as acute myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death. This report describes a married couple who expressed an apparently passionate interest in football with hazardous consequences after a tense football match during the FIFA 2014 World Championships. A series of emotional stressors initiated by defeat in this football game lead to cardiac arrest in a 58-year-old man caused by a thrombotic occlusion of the left anterior descending artery and ending in the death of the patient. An hour and 15 minutes after the onset of cardiac arrest of the patient, his 64-year-old wife also had chest pain caused by an acute midventricular takotsubo syndrome. She survived the acute stage of the disease, and there was complete resolution of the left ventricular dysfunction. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

,A Mixed Reality System For Kansei-Based Co-Design Of Highly-Customized Products,"We designed a new Computer-Aided Design tool that can be easily and intuitively used by non-expert designers, like users of the products being designed. The target application is the design of highly-customized products together with the final users, more specifically the design of walking assistive devices with mobility-impaired people. The tool has simultaneously been developed with an ad-hoc protocol for an accurate evaluation of the satisfaction of users, through questionnaires and psychophysiological measurements. In fact, costly and complex technical products such as walking assistance devices require ad-hoc design processes to address the specific needs of each user. The characterization of user requirements in the early stage of design remains difficult due to their subjective and communication gap between the user and the designer. To overcome these issues, we propose a new modular digital toolbox that allows co-design between users and designers. The tool is a combination of a mixed reality hardware/software system and kansei (or affective) engineering techniques. The hardware consists of modular Tangible User Interfaces (TUIs), custom-made by 3D printing and powered by a 3D game engine. The interactive content is displayed in mixed reality, simultaneously to the user and the designer. Kansei data of the users are collected through questionnaires and psychophysical measurements during multiple collaboration phases. ©2016-Society for Design and Process Science.All rights reserved.",doi,10.3233/jid-2016-0013,Scopus,Journal of Integrated Design and Process Science,"Arrighi P.-A., Maurya S., Arai K., Moriya K., Mougenot C.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,A Novel Educational Game For Teaching Emotion Identification Skills To Preschoolers With Autism Diagnosis,"Emotion recognition is essential in human communication and social interaction. Children with autism have been reported to exhibit deficits in understanding and expressing emotions. Those deficits seem to be rather permanent so intervention tools for improving those impairments are desirable. Educational interventions for teaching emotion recognition should occur as early as possible. It is argued that Serious Games can be very effective in the areas of therapy and education for children with autism. However, those computer interventions require considerable skills for interaction. Before the age of 6, most children with autism do not have such basic motor skills in order to manipulate a mouse or a keyboard. Our approach takes account of the specific characteristics of preschoolers with autism and their physical inabilities. By creating an educational computer game, which provides physical interaction with natural user interface (NUI), we aim to support early intervention and to enhance emotion recognition skills.",doi,10.2298/CSIS121212041,Scopus,Computer Science and Information Systems,"Christinaki E., Vidakis N., Triantafyllidis G.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,A Socratic Epistemology For Verbal Emotional Intelligence,"We describe and experimentally validate a question-asking framework for machinelearned linguistic knowledge about human emotions. Using the Socratic method as a theoretical inspiration, we develop an experimental method and computational model for computers to learn subjective information about emotions by playing emotion twenty questions (EMO20Q), a game of twenty questions limited to words denoting emotions. Using human-human EMO20Q data we bootstrap a sequential Bayesian model that drives a generalized pushdown automaton-based dialog agent that further learns from 300 human-computer dialogs collected on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The human-human EMO20Q dialogs show the capability of humans to use a large, rich, subjective vocabulary of emotion words. Training on successive batches of human-computer EMO20Q dialogs shows that the automated agent is able to learn fromsubsequent human-computer interactions. Our results show that the training procedure enables the agent to learn a large set of emotion words. The fully trained agent successfully completes EMO20Q at 67% of human performance and 30% better than the bootstrapped agent. Even when the agent fails to guess the human opponent's emotion word in the EMO20Q game, the agent's behavior of searching for knowledge makes it appear human-like, which enables the agent to maintain user engagement and learn new, out-of-vocabulary words. These results lead us to conclude that the question-asking methodology and its implementation as a sequential Bayes pushdown automaton are a successful model for the cognitive abilities involved in learning, retrieving, and using emotion words by an automated agent in a dialog setting. © 2016 Kazemzadeh et al.",doi,10.7717/peerj-cs.40,Scopus,PeerJ Computer Science,"Kazemzadeh A., Gibson J., Georgiou P., Lee S., Narayanan S.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,A Study In Users' Physiological Response To An Empathic Interface Agent,"This paper presents a novel method for evaluating the impact of animated interface agents with affective and empathic behavior. While previous studies relied on questionnaires in order to assess the user's overall experience with the interface agent, we will analyze users' physiological response (skin conductance and electromyography), which allows us to estimate affect-related user experiences on a moment-by-moment basis without interfering with the primary interaction task. As an interaction scenario, a card game has been implemented where the user plays against a virtual opponent. The findings of our study indicate that within a competitive gaming scenario, (i) the absence of the agent's display of negative emotions is conceived as arousing or stress-inducing, and (ii) the valence of users' emotional response is congruent with the valence of the emotion expressed by the agent. Our results for skin conductance could also be reproduced by assuming a local rather than a global baseline. © 2006 World Scientific Publishing Company.",doi,10.1142/S0219843606000801,Scopus,International Journal of Humanoid Robotics,"Prendinger H., Becker C., Ishizuka M.",2006,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,A Tactile Luminous Floor For An Interactive Autonomous Space,"This paper describes the interactive tactile luminous floor that was constructed and used as the skin of the playful interactive space Ada, which ran as a public exhibit for five months in 2002 and had over 550,000 visitors. Ada's floor was custom-built to provide a means for individual and collective user interaction. It consists of 360 hexagonal 66 cm tiles covering a total area of 136 m2, each with analogue tactile load sensors based on force-sensitive resistors and dimmable neon red, green and blue (RGB) lamps. The tiles are constructed from extruded aluminum with glass tops. An Interbus factory automation bus senses and controls the tiles. Software is described for rendering fluid, dynamic visual effects on the floor, for signal processing of the load information, for real-time visitor tracking and for a variety of behavioural modes, games and interactions. Data from single tiles and from tracking are shown. This floor offers new modalities of human-computer interaction and human-robot interaction for autonomous robotic spaces. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

,Active Video Games As A Form Of Exercise And The Effect Of Gaming Experience: A Preliminary Study In Healthy Young Adults,"Objectives: To examine the energy expenditure and heart rate response while playing active video games, and the effect of gaming experience on energy expenditure. Design: Cross-sectional study. Participants and interventions: Twenty-eight healthy participants (18 male, age 19 to 27 years) played either Wii Sports Boxing, Tennis and Baseball, or Wii Sports Boxing and Wii Fit Free Jogging. Main outcome measures: Percentage maximal heart rate (%HRmax) and metabolic equivalents (METs) were measured during 15. minutes of rest and during each game. Results: Mean %HRmax and METs while playing each of the four games were as follows: Wii Fit Free Jogging 71% [standard deviation (SD) 13%], 5.9 (SD 1.8); Wii Sports Boxing 58% (SD 13%), 3.2 (SD 1.1); Wii Sports Baseball 42% (SD 6%), 2.0 (SD 0.5); and Wii Sports Tennis 42% (SD 7%), 2.0 (SD 0.4). Subjects with gaming experience achieved a lower heart rate playing Wii Sports Tennis compared with subjects without gaming experience. Conclusions: Wii Sports Boxing, Tennis and Baseball are light-intensity activities, and Wii Fit Free Jogging is a moderate-intensity activity. Experience of gaming may affect the exercise intensity of games requiring controller skill. © 2012 Chartered Society of Physiotherapy.",doi,10.1016/j.physio.2012.05.001,Scopus,Physiotherapy (United Kingdom),"O'Donovan C., Hussey J.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Acute Effects Of Video-Game Playing Versus Television Viewing On Stress Markers And Food Intake In Overweight And Obese Young Men: A Randomised Controlled Trial,"Background Sedentary or near-sedentary activities are associated with overweight/obesity in epidemiological studies. This has traditionally been attributed to physical activity displacement. A little-explored area is whether behavioural stresses alter sensations of appetite and eating behaviour. We examined whether behaviours conducted seated (television viewing, video gaming) induce different eating patterns, associated with differential levels of stress response. Methods and findings We conducted a randomized controlled trial in 72 overweight/obese adult males, assigned to three groups (24 per group): (i) non-violent television (control group); (ii) non-violent game (FIFA); (iii) violent game (Call of Duty). Following a standardized breakfast, the 1-h intervention was followed by 25-min rest, with sweet and savoury snacks and drinks available ad libitum. Stress markers (heart rate, blood pressure, visual analogue scale (VAS)) were measured throughout. Heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and stress by VAS were significantly higher (p < 0.05) playing video games than watching non-violent television, though the two game groups did not differ. Considered separately, only the violent video game group consumed more energy (Δ = 208.3 kcal, 95%CI 16, 400), sweet foods (Δ = 25.9 g, 95%CI 9.9, 41.9) and saturated fat (Δ = 4.36 g, 95%CI 0.76, 7.96) than controls. Conclusion Playing video games in overweight/obese adult males is associated with an acute stress response relative to watching non-violent television, associated with greater subsequent food intake. These findings highlight the need to focus on the metabolic effects, as well as the energy costs, of activities involving sitting in relation to obesity risk. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",doi,10.1016/j.appet.2017.08.018,Scopus,Appetite,"Siervo M., Gan J., Fewtrell M.S., Cortina-Borja M., Wells J.C.K.",2018,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Acute Effects Of Violent Video-Game Playing On Blood Pressure And Appetite Perception In Normal-Weight Young Men: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"Watching television and playing video game being seated represent sedentary behaviours and increase the risk of weight gain and hypertension. We investigated the acute effects of violent and non-violent video-game playing on blood pressure (BP), appetite perception and food preferences. Forty-eight young, normal-weight men (age: 23.1±1.9 years; body mass index: 22.5±1.9 kg/m 2) participated in a three-arm, randomized trial. Subjects played a violent video game, a competitive, non-violent video game or watched TV for 1 h. Measurements of BP, stress and appetite perception were recorded before a standardized meal (∼300 kcal) and then repeated every 15 min throughout the intervention. Violent video-game playing was associated with a significant increase in diastolic BP (Δ±s.d.=+7.5±5.8 mm Hg; P=0.04) compared with the other two groups. Subjects playing violent video games felt less full (P=0.02) and reported a tendency towards sweet food consumption. Video games involving violence appear to be associated with significant effects on BP and appetite perceptions compared with non-violent gaming or watching TV. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",doi,10.1038/ejcn.2013.180,Scopus,European Journal of Clinical Nutrition,"Siervo M., Sabatini S., Fewtrell M.S., Wells J.C.K.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Acute Nonhypothermic Exposure To Cold Impedes Motor Skill Performance In Video Gaming Compared To Thermo-Neutral And Hot Conditions,"The study examined whether or not acute exposure to unfamiliar hot or cold conditions impairs performance of highly skilled coordinative activities and whether prior physical self-efficacy beliefs were associated with task completion. Nineteen volunteers completed both Guitar Hero® and Archery® activities as a test battery using the Nintendo Wii® console in cold (2°C), neutral (20°C), and hot (38°C) conditions. Participants all completed physical self-efficacy questionnaires following experimental familiarization. Performances of both Guitar Hero and Archery significantly decreased in the cold compared with the neutral condition. The cold trial was also perceived as the condition requiring both greater concentration and effort. There was no association between performance and physical self-efficacy. Performance of these coordinative tasks was compromised by acute (nonhypothermic) exposure to cold; the most likely explanation is that the cold condition presented a greater challenge to attentional processes as a form of environmental distraction. © Perceptual and Motor Skills 2011.",doi,10.2466/25.PMS.112.1.217-227,Scopus,Perceptual and Motor Skills,"Edwards A.M., Crowther R.G., Hugh Morton R., Polman R.C.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,"Adolescent Neck And Shoulder Pain - The Association With Depression, Physical Activity, Screen-Based Activities, And Use Of Health Care Services","Purpose Neck and shoulder pain is frequent in adolescents, and multiple factors seem to affect the risk of such symptoms. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of neck and shoulder pain in Norwegian adolescence and to examine whether behavioral and emotional factors were associated with the risk of neck and shoulder pain. Finally we aimed to investigate whether neck and shoulder pain was related to the use of health services. Method Data from the population-based study ung@hordaland were used. Participants were asked how often during the last 6 months they had experienced neck and shoulder pain. The association between frequent neck and shoulder pain and physical activity, symptoms of depression, and screen-based activities was evaluated using logistic regression analyses stratified by gender. The relative risk of visiting health services when reporting neck and shoulder pain was calculated using multiple logistic regression analyses. Results Frequent neck and shoulder pain was reported by 20.0% (1,797 of the total 8,990) and more often by girls than boys (p <.001). A high score of depressive symptoms was the strongest risk factor for neck and shoulder pain in both boys and girls (odds ratio = 6.14 [95% confidence interval 4.48-8.42] and odds ratio = 3.10 [95% confidence interval 2.63-3.67], respectively). Frequent screen-based activities slightly increased the risk while physical activity was protective. Individuals reporting neck and shoulder pain more often visited their general practitioner (47.1% vs. 31.8%) and school health services (24.6% vs. 13.5%). Conclusion Frequent neck and shoulder pain was reported in 20% of Norwegian adolescents. Symptoms of depression and screen-based activities increased the risk of neck and shoulder pain while physical activity was protective. Individuals reporting neck and shoulder pain visited health services more frequently than others. © 2014 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

,Affect Of The Game Player: Short-Term Effects Of Highly And Mildly Aggressive Video Games.,"Two experiments were conducted to examine the effects of playing different types of video games on players' short-term affective states. In the first experiment, college student subjects played 11 different video games and rated them on a number of characteristics. From these ratings, two games were selected for use in Experiment 2. These games differed only in the level of aggression displayed. One was highly aggressive; the other was only mildly aggressive. In Experiment 2, each subject played one of the games or was assigned to a no-game control condition. Hostility, anxiety, and depression subsequently were assessed by the Multiple Affect Adjective Checklist. Hostility was increased in both game conditions, relative to the control group. The high-aggression game led to higher hostility than the mild-aggression game, but the difference was not significant. However, those who had played the high-aggression game were significantly more anxious than either those who played the mild-aggression game or those who played no game (control). As expected, the experimental manipulation of game playing did not yield a main effect on depressive affect. Finally, there was a marginally significant sex by game interaction effect on the depression scores.",doi,10.1177/0146167286124002,anderson2010,Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin,"Anderson, C.

,Affection Arousal Based Highlight Extraction For Soccer Video,"Highlight extraction, as one of the key technologies in soccer video retrieval and summarization, has great academic and application value. According to the principle that the observer’s affection state would fluctuate with the evolution of game process when watching soccer match video, a novel highlight extraction approach based on the improved affection arousal model is proposed. Compared with the existing works, our main contributions include the following. A novel feature – shot intensity is exploited to replace the motion activity, which greatly improves the computational performance of affection arousal model. Another helpful feature – replay factor is designed and successfully fused into the affection arousal model. This makes the affection arousal model reflect the variation of the true match process more accurately. In addition, event temporal transition pattern (ETTP) in soccer video is utilized to detect highlights boundaries effectively combined with the affection arousal curve. Experiments conducted on real-world soccer game videos have demonstrated the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",doi,10.1007/s11042-013-1619-1,Scopus,Multimedia Tools and Applications,"Wang Z., Yu J., He Y., Guan T.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Aggression In Children With Behavioural/Emotional Difficulties: Seeing Aggression On Television And Video Games,"Background: Mental health professionals are often asked to give advice about managing children's aggression. Good quality evidence on contributory environmental factors such as seeing aggression on television and in video games is relatively lacking, although societal and professional concerns are high. This study investigated possible associations between seeing aggression in such media and the aggressive behaviour of children attending specialist outpatient child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS). Methods: In this mixed methods study, forty-seven British children aged 7-11 years with behavioural/emotional difficulties attending CAMHS and their carers participated in a survey twenty purposively-selected children and a parent/carer of theirs participated in a qualitative study, involving semi-structured interviews, analysed using the Framework Analysis Approach; findings were integrated. Results: Children attending CAMHS exhibit clinically significant aggression, of varying types and frequency. They see aggression in multiple real and virtual settings. Verbal aggression was often seen, frequently exhibited and strongly associated with poor peer relationships and low prosocial behaviour. Children did not think seeing aggression influences their own behaviour but believed it influences others. Carers regarded aggression as resulting from a combination of inner and environmental factors and seeing aggression in real-life as having more impact than television/video games. Conclusions: There is yet no definitive evidence for or against a direct relationship between aggression seen in the media and aggression in children with behavioural/emotional difficulties. Future research should take an ecological perspective, investigating individual, developmental and environmental factors. Carers, professional organisations and policy makers should address aggression seen in all relevant area of children's lives, primarily real-life and secondly virtual environments. © 2014 Mitrofan et al.",doi,10.1186/s12888-014-0287-7,Scopus,BMC Psychiatry,"Mitrofan O., Paul M., Weich S., Spencer N.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Aggressive Outcomes And Videogame Play: The Role Of Length Of Play And The Mechanisms At Work,"Recent meta-analytic findings (Sherry, 2007) suggest that the effect of violent video games on aggression tends to decrease the longer participants play. Therefore, it is likely that different mechanisms may be at work depending on the length of play. In this study, we employed a 4 (length of game play) × 2 (sex) design to examine the effect of length of video game play on aggressive outcomes. Findings suggest that length of play may be curvilinearly related to verbal and physical aggression, and that arousal may mediate this response. Implications for our current understanding of the relationship between video games and aggression are discussed, along with directions for further research. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",doi,10.1080/15213260903052257,Scopus,Media Psychology,"Krcmar M., Lachlan K.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Altered Autonomic Functions And Distressed Personality Traits In Male Adolescents With Internet Gaming Addiction,"Internet gaming addiction (IGA) has been associated with many negative health outcomes, especially for youth; however, few studies have examined the physiological parameters and personality features related to this addiction. This study aimed to identify differences in autonomic functions and distressed (type D) personality traits among Korean adolescent males with and without IGA. In a cross-sectional study, 68 adolescent males were recruited in a Korean city using convenience and snowball sampling methods. For each subject, heart rate variability (HRV) parameters were measured as autonomic functions and questionnaires were used to identify IGA and type D personality traits. Data were analyzed using descriptive analyses, t tests, χ2 tests, and Pearson's correlation. Most HRV parameters significantly differed between the IGA and non-IGA groups (all p &lt; 0.05). Type D personality total and subscale scores, including those for negative affectivity (NA) and social inhibition, were significantly higher in the IGA group (all p &lt; 0.001). Of the 68 subjects, 46 were classified as having type D personality, with nearly twice as many in the IGA group as in the non-IGA group (p = 0.002). Type D personality total scores negatively correlated with the logarithmic value of total power and low frequency among the HRV parameters (both p &lt; 0.05). Results showed that excessive Internet gaming was related to alterations in autonomic functions and distressed personality traits in male adolescents. These findings provide further understanding of the IGA phenomenon and highlight the need for interventions that address male adolescents with IGA. © Copyright 2016, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016.",doi,10.1089/cyber.2016.0282,Scopus,"Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking","Kim N., Hughes T.L., Park C.G., Quinn L., Kong I.D.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Altered Functional Connectivity Of The Insula And Nucleus Accumbens In Internet Gaming Disorder: A Resting State Fmri Study,"Aims: A possible addiction mechanism has been represented by altered functional connectivity (FC) in the resting state. The aim of this study was to evaluate the FCs of the insula and nucleus accumbens among subjects with Internet gaming disorder (IGD). Methods: We recruited 30 males with IGD and 30 controls and evaluated their FC using functional magnetic imaging scanning under resting, a state with relaxation, closed eyes, with inducement to think of nothing systematically, become motionless, and instructed not to fall asleep. Results: Subjects with IGD had a lower FC with the left insula over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and orbital frontal lobe and a higher FC with the insula with the contralateral insula than controls. The inter-hemispheric insula connectivity positively correlated with impulsivity. Further, they had lower FC with the left nucleus accumbens over the left DLPFC and with the right nucleus accumbens over the left DLPFC, and insula and a higher FC with that over the right precuneus. Conclusion: The elevated inter-hemispheric insula FC is found to be associated with impulsivity and might explain why it is involved in IGD. The attenuated frontostriatal suggests that the emotion-driven gaming urge through nucleus accumbens could not be well regulated by the frontal lobe of subjects with IGD. © 2016 S.

,An Assessment Of Emotional Reactivity To Frustration Of Goal Pursuit In Euthymic Bipolar I Disorder,"Affective disturbance is a central feature of bipolar disorder. Many investigators have hypothesized that euthymic people with bipolar disorder might display elevated emotional reactivity, but laboratory studies of emotional reactivity have had mixed results. Drawing on theories of bipolar disorder that emphasize dysregulation of goal pursuit, we hypothesized that people with bipolar disorder might be emotionally hyperreactive to frustration of goal pursuit. Forty-seven euthymic participants with bipolar disorder and 43 control participants played a computer game for a monetary reward. To induce frustration, we programmed the game to respond inconsistently to user input during two periods. The frustration induction was successful as measured by self-report, physiological responding, and facial behavior, but contrary to the hypothesis of emotional hyperreactivity in bipolar disorder, the bipolar and control groups were equally reactive to frustration. Future studies will benefit from more specific hypotheses about how emotion might be altered in bipolar disorder. © The Author(s) 2014.",doi,10.1177/2167702614555412,Scopus,Clinical Psychological Science,"Edge M.D., Lwi S.J., Johnson S.L.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,An Online Spaced-Education Game Among Clinicians Improves Their Patients' Time To Blood Pressure Control A Randomized Controlled Trial,"Background-Many patients with high blood pressure (BP) do not have antihypertensive medications appropriately intensified at clinician visits. We investigated whether an online spaced-education (SE) game among primary care clinicians can decrease time to BP target among their hypertensive patients. Methods and Results-A 2-arm randomized trial was conducted over 52 weeks among primary care clinicians at 8 hospitals. Educational content consisted of 32 validated multiple-choice questions with explanations on hypertension management. Providers were randomized into 2 groups: SE clinicians were enrolled in the game, whereas control clinicians received identical educational content in an online posting. SE game clinicians were e-mailed 1 question every 3 days. Adaptive game mechanics resent questions in 12 or 24 days if answered incorrectly or correctly, respectively. Clinicians retired questions by answering each correctly twice consecutively. Posting of relative performance among peers fostered competition. Primary outcome measure was time to BP target (>140/90 mm Hg). One hundred eleven clinicians enrolled. The SE game was completed by 87% of clinicians (48/55), whereas 84% of control clinicians (47/56) read the online posting. In multivariable analysis of 17 866 hypertensive periods among 14 336 patients, the hazard ratio for time to BP target in the SE game cohort was 1.043 (95% confidence interval, 1.007-1.081; P=0.018). The number of hypertensive episodes needed to treat to normalize one additional patient's BP was 67.8. The number of clinicians needed to teach to achieve this was 0.43. Conclusions-An online SE game among clinicians generated a modest but significant reduction in the time to BP target among their hypertensive patients. © 2014 American Heart Association, Inc.",doi,10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.113.000814,Scopus,Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes,"Kerfoot B.P., Turchin A., Breydo E., Gagnon D., Conlin P.R.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Analysing The Influence Of The Fitness Function On Genetically Programmed Bots For A Real-Time Strategy Game,"Finding the global best strategy for an autonomous agent (bot) in a RTS game is a hard problem, mainly because the techniques applied to do this must deal with uncertainty and real-time planning in order to control the game agents. This work describes an approach applying a Genetic Programming (GP) algorithm to create the behavioural engine of bots able to play a simple RTS. Normally it is impossible to know in advance what kind of strategies will be the best in the most general case of this problem. So GP, which searches the general decision tree space, has been introduced and used successfully. However, it is not straightforward what fitness function would be the most convenient to guide the evolutionary process in order to reach the best solutions and also being less sensitive to the uncertainty present in the context of games. Thus, in this paper three different evaluation functions have been proposed, and a detailed analysis of their performance has been conducted. The paper also analyses several aspects of the obtained bots, in addition to their final performance on battles, such as the evolution of the decision trees (behavioural models) themselves, or the influence on the results of noise or uncertainty. The results show that a victory-based fitness, which prioritises the number of victories, contributes to generate better bots, on average, than other functions based on other numerical aspects of the battles, such as the number of resources gathered, or the number of units generated. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",doi,10.1016/j.entcom.2016.08.001,Scopus,Entertainment Computing,"Fernández-Ares A., Mora A.M., García-Sánchez P., Castillo P.A., Merelo J.J.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Anger Mediates The Effect Of Ostracism On Risk-Taking,"The present research tested the effects of being ostracized on risk-taking behavior and how emotional responses to ostracism mediate these effects. In two experiments, undergraduates were either ostracized or included during an Internet ball-toss game (Cyberball). In Experiment 1 (N = 52), ostracism increased self-reported risk-taking inclinations, and the relation between ostracism and risk-taking was mediated by feelings of anger, but not control. In Experiment 2 (N = 72), ostracism increased risky driving during a driving video game. The effect of ostracism on risk-taking was again mediated by post-ostracism anger (but not control or ostracism-induced sadness). This research suggests that anger elicited by ostracism may increase risk-taking. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",doi,10.1080/13669877.2014.1003320,Scopus,Journal of Risk Research,"Svetieva E., Zadro L., Denson T.F., Dale E., O’Moore K., Zheng W.Y.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Anthropomorphized Helpers Undermine Autonomy And Enjoyment In Computer Games,"Although digital assistants with humanlike features have become prevalent in computer games, few marketing studies have demonstrated the psychological mechanisms underlying consumers' reactions to digital assistants and their subsequent influence on consumers' game enjoyment. To fill this gap, the current study examined the effect of anthropomorphic representations of computerized helpers in computer games on game enjoyment. In the current research, consumers enjoyed a computer game less when they received assistance from a computerized helper imbued with humanlike features than from a helper construed as a mindless entity. We offer a novel mechanism that the presence of an anthropomorphized helper can undermine individuals' perceived autonomy during a computer game. Across six experiments, we show that the presence of an anthropomorphized helper reduced game enjoyment across three different games. By measuring participants' perceived autonomy (study 1) and employing moderators such as importance of autonomy (studies 2, 3, and 4), we also provide evidence that the reduced feeling of autonomy serves as the mechanism underlying the backfiring effect. Finally, we demonstrate that the effect of anthropomorphism on game enjoyment can be extended to other game-related outcomes, such as individuals' motivation to persist in the game (studies 4 and 5). © The Author 2016.",doi,10.1093/jcr/ucw016,Scopus,Journal of Consumer Research,"Kim S., Chen R.P., Zhang K.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,"Are Hospital Workers Healthy?: A Study Of Cardiometabolic, Behavioral, And Psychosocial Factors Associatedwith Obesity Among Hospital Workers","Objective: This study evaluated the cardiometabolic, behavioral, and psychosocial factors associated with weight status among hospital employees. Methods: A total of n=924 employees across the six hospitals in Texas participated in this cross-sectional study, 2012 to 2013. Association between weight status and waist circumference, blood pressure, biomarkers, diet, physical activity, sedentary behaviors, and psychosocial factors was assessed. Results: About 78.1% of employees were overweight/obese. Obese participants (body mass index [BMI] ≥30.0 kg/m2) had higher consumption of potatoes, fats, sugary beverages, and spent more time watching television, playing computer games, and sitting than those having normal weight. Being obese was positively associated with blood pressure, blood glucose, low-density lipoprotein, and negatively associated with highdensity lipoprotein. Finally, 78.8% of workers were dissatisfied with their worksite wellness with dissatisfaction being higher among obese employees. Being overweight (BMI 25.0 to 29.9 kg/m2) was positively associated with blood pressure, but not other variables. Conclusion: Understanding the risk profile of hospital workers is critical to developing effective interventions.

,Are Violent Video Games Harmful?,"Objective: The aim of this paper is to revisit the controversial issue of the association of violent video games and aggressive behaviour. Conclusions: Several lines of evidence suggest that there is a link between exposure to violent video games and aggressive behaviour. However, methodological shortcomings of research conducted so far make several interpretations of this relationship possible. Thus, aggressive behaviour may be a consequence of playing violent video games, an expression of hostile traits that existed before exposure to these games, and/or it may be a result of several possible combinations of these and other factors. Mental health professionals need to be aware of these potentially negative effects of violent video games when assessing patients who present with aggression. There is a need for prospective, long-term studies similar to those evaluating the effects of television and film violence on children and adolescents.",doi,10.1080/10398560701463343,Scopus,Australasian Psychiatry,"Porter G., Starcevic V.",2007,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Arterial Pulse Transit Time And Ecg-Initiated Transit Time: The Form Of The Conditioned Responses,"Arterial pulse transit time (PTT), ECG-initiated transit time (ECG-TT), and interbeat interval were recorded during a differential classical conditioning procedure with a commercial video game functioning as the unconditioned stimulus. In Experiment 1, subjects were presented with 20 acquisition trials. Both PTT and ECG-TT showed differential changes to the CS+ and CS-. The PTT CR took the form of a decrease in transit time, reaching maximum between 5 and 7 beats after CS onset, and the ECG-TT response was biphasic, consisting of an initial lengthening from baseline during the first three beats after CS onset followed by a decrease below baseline, reaching maximum at Beats 8–10. Experiment 2 is a replication of Experiment 1 using 40 acquisition trials. PTT and ECG-TT CRs were similar to those observed in Experiment 1 and persisted during the 40 trials. The PTT decrease from baseline during Beats 5–7 was significant, as were the deceleratory and acceleratory ECG-TT components. © 1984, Psychonomic Society, Inc..

The players were 13 university students with experience in the online game and their average playing time per month was 33 hours and the average month of experience was 38 months. Each group member was asked to participate in game events together as a party to keep talking with each other and asked to use a voice chat system and were prohibited from using a text chat function provided by the online game system when they talked with each other. The voice-recording system for Skype, Tapur, recorded the local player's voice and remote player's voices in individual channels of a stereo sound file.

,"Associations Between Parental Rules, Style Of Communication And Children's Screen Time Health Behavior, Health Promotion And Society","Background: Research suggests an inverse association between parental rules and screen time in pre-adolescents, and that parents' style of communication with their children is related to the children's time spent watching TV. The aims of this study were to examine associations of parental rules and parental style of communication with children's screen time and perceived excessive screen time in five European countries. Methods: UP4FUN was a multi-centre, cluster randomised controlled trial with pre- and post-test measurements in each of five countries; Belgium, Germany, Greece, Hungary and Norway. Questionnaires were completed by the children at school and the parent questionnaire was brought home. Three structural equation models were tested based on measures of screen time and parental style of communication from the pre-test questionnaires. Discussion: Of the 152 schools invited, 62 (41 %) schools agreed to participate. In total 3325 children (average age 11.2 years and 51 % girls) and 3038 parents (81 % mothers) completed the pre-test questionnaire. The average TV/DVD times across the countries were between 1.5 and 1.8 h/day, while less time was used for computer/games console (0.9-1.4 h/day). The children's perceived parental style of communication was quite consistent for TV/DVD and computer/games console. The presence of rules was significantly associated with less time watching TV/DVD and use of computer/games console time. Moreover, the use of an autonomy-supportive style was negatively related to both time watching TV/DVD and use of computer/games console time. The use of a controlling style was related positively to perceived excessive time used on TV/DVD and excessive time used on computer/games console. With a few exceptions, results were similar across the five countries. Conclusions: This study suggests that an autonomy-supportive style of communicating rules for TV/DVD or computer/ games console use is negatively related to children's time watching TV/DVD and use of computer/games console time. In contrast, a controlling style is associated with more screen time and with more perceived excessive screen time in particular. Longitudinal research is needed to further examine effects of parental style of communication on children's screen time as well as possible reciprocal effects.

,Asthma And Physical Activity In Multiracial Girls From Three Us Sites,"Objective: Studies comparing physical activity levels in children with and without asthma have had mixed results. Our objective was to investigate the association between asthma diagnosis and physical activity and to examine differences in these associations by race/ethnicity, weight status and caregiver education. Methods: We investigated the association between asthma (defined as report of physician-diagnosed asthma with at least one asthma related symptom) and measures of physical and sedentary activity in a study of 6- to 8-year-old girls in the Breast Cancer and the Environment Research Project. We compared reported activity and pedometer measurements among girls with and without asthma, and examined modification of these associations by race/ethnicity, weight status and caregiver education. Results: Girls (n=1182) were included with 33.5% White, 4.8% Asian, 30.6% non Hispanic Black and 30.7% Hispanic. Asthma was present in 16.2% of girls. Overall, 38% of girls reported no participation in organized recreational activities and 58% had >2h/day of television, video game and computer time combined. Girls with asthma whose parents were less educated reported fewer pedometer steps and less non-scheduled activity than girls without asthma with similar caregiver education level. Among girls with asthma, those on a controller medication had higher levels of sedentary activity and more structured physical activity but were less likely to report high intensity physical activity. Conclusions: Among girls whose parents are less educated, girls with asthma may have lower physical activity levels than girls without asthma. Use of a controller medication may be related to physical and sedentary activity. © 2014 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.",doi,10.3109/02770903.2013.853081,Scopus,Journal of Asthma,"Vangeepuram N., Mcgovern K.J., Teitelbaum S., Galvez M.P., Pinney S.M., Biro F.M., Kushi L.H., Wolff M.S.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Automatic And Autonomous Load Management In Peer-To-Peer Virtual Environments,"The very notion of a fully Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Virtual Environment (VE) places exacting demands on its underlying network. Subset applications such as online games are notorious for their sensitivity to latency and high bandwidth demands. By omitting the centralised mechanisms that underpin current commercial implementations, the task of managing a disparate and dynamic peer population is made ever more daunting. For any VE, arbitrating the interactions between players is an inescapable need. Online games are equal parts collaboration and competition, requiring robust conflict resolution mechanisms to govern game-play. With centralised systems, arbitration duties are simply assigned to a provisioned server infrastructure. In a P2P system however, the issue looms large. As such, managing arbitration loads across the peer population is the focus here. Being a game-play arbitrator entails added bandwidth and processing demands. Thus, great care is needed to avoid overloading peers whilst providing a responsive and uninterrupted experience. The work here exploits 3D Voronoi Diagrams (3D-VD) as a scalable, flexible and fault-tolerant P2P overlay that is able to automatically balance arbitration loads amongst peers. Simulation results indicate how 3D-VD, with the right arbitrator-selection policy, can appropriately distribute loads and reduce load fluctuations by up to 90%. This is then augmented with algorithms based on classical Newtonian gravity laws. Doing so provides an autonomous method to detect and respond to high-demand areas within the VE. Further experimentation demonstrates an ability to reduce the instances of failed arbitration attempts by 50%. © 2013 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/JSAC.2013.SUP.0513028,Scopus,IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications,"Almashor M., Khalil I., Tari Z., Zomaya A.Y.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Automatic Speech Recognition- An Approach For Designing Inclusive Games,"Computer games are now a part of our modern culture. However, certain categories of people are excluded from this form of entertainment and social interaction because they are unable to use the interface of the games. The reason for this can be deficits in motor control, vision or hearing. By using automatic speech recognition systems (ASR), voice driven commands can be used to control the game, which can thus open up the possibility for people with motor system difficulty to be included in game communities. This paper aims at find a standard way of using voice commands in games which uses a speech recognition system in the backend, and that can be universally applied for designing inclusive games. Present speech recognition systems however, do not support emotions, attitudes, tones etc. This is a drawback because such expressions can be vital for gaming. Taking multiple types of existing genres of games into account and analyzing their voice command requirements, a general ASRS module is proposed which can work as a common platform for designing inclusive games. A fuzzy logic controller proposed then is to enhance the system. The standard voice driven module can be based on algorithm or fuzzy controller which can be used to design software plug-ins or can be included in microchip. It then can be integrated with the game engines; creating the possibility of voice driven universal access for controlling games. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",doi,10.1007/s11042-011-0918-7,Scopus,Multimedia Tools and Applications,Mustaquim M.M.,2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Background Music Matters: Why Video Games Lead To Increased Aggressive Behavior?,"Previous research has shown that violent video game exposure increases aggressive thoughts, aggressive feelings, aggressive behavior and physiological arousal. However, most of the research in this field has only focused on the ""video"" aspect of these games, and little attention has been paid to the ""audio"". In this study, both background music within video games and the games themselves were used as two independent variables to test their influence on physical excitement and aggression. Physical excitement was measured using biofeedback equipment and aggression was measured using the hot sauce paradigm. Results showed that both music and video games can cause significant increases in physical excitement, while violent video games cause higher levels of physical excitement than non-violent games. The excitement level of the background music interacted with the game content to give a combined effect on aggression. Thus, the present study extended prior findings by showing that background music has an indispensable role in the level of aggression induced through video games. The results also demonstrated that it is both necessary and beneficial to design background music for video games in such a way that it matches the action taking place in the game. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",doi,10.1016/j.entcom.2014.01.002,Scopus,Entertainment Computing,"Zhang J., Gao X.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Behaviour Based On Decision Matrices For A Coordination Between Agents In A Urban Traffic Simulation,"This paper describes a multi-agent coordination mechanism applied to intersection simulation situations. In a goal of urban traffic simulation, we must consider the dynamic interactions between autonomous vehicles. The field of multi-agent systems provides us some studies for such systems, in particular on the coordination mechanisms. Conflicts between vehicles (i.e. agents) are very frequent in such applications, and they may cause deadlocks, particularly at intersections such as crossroads. Our approach is based on the solving of two player games/decision matrices which characterize three basic situations. An aggregation method generalizes to n-player games for complex crossroads. The objective of this approach consists in searching basic two-player matrices for solving n-agent problems. To explain the principle, we describe our approach for a particular case of crossroad with three agents. Finally, the obtained results have been examined via a tool of road traffic simulation, ARCHISIM. We assume also that the global traffic replicates the behavior of agents in different situations. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",doi,10.1007/s10489-007-0045-3,Scopus,Applied Intelligence,"Mandiau R., Champion A., Auberlet J.-M., Espié S., Kolski C.",2008,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Behaviourally Rich Actions For User-Controlled Characters,"The increasing use of animated characters and avatars in computer games and 3D online worlds requires increasingly complex behaviour with increasingly simple and easy to use control systems. This paper presents a system for user-controlled actions that aims at simplicity and ease of use while being enhanced by modern animation techniques to produce rich and complex behaviour. We use inverse kinematics based motion adaptation to make pre-existing pieces of motion apply to new targets. The expressiveness of the character is enhanced by adding autonomous behaviour, in this case eye gaze behaviour. This behaviour is generated autonomously but is still influenced by the actions that the user is requesting the character to perform. The actions themselves are simple for a designer with no programming experience to design and for an end user to customise. They are also very simple to invoke. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

,Bench Behaviour Of Ice Hockey Coaches: Psychophysiological And Verbal Responses To Critical Game Incidents,"The purpose of this study was to examine coaches’ psychophysiological and verbal responses to different game situations. The in-game heart rate and verbal responses of three elite ice hockey coaches to four critical game incidents (Goals For/Against; Penalties Taken/Drawn) over four university women’s games were assessed. Verbal comments were categorised using the Coach Behaviour Assessment System, and then comments and heart rate were sequenced to critical incidents recorded on video review. Overall, in-game heart rate was greater than rest and coaches were rarely silent. General encouragement and general commentary were the most common verbal comments. Two hundred and eight critical incident comments were recorded (Goals For/Against 34.6 %; Penalties Taken/Drawn 65.4%) associated with a 10 bpm greater heart rate. Most common verbal responses to critical incidents were general commentary, silence and organisation. The type of comment was affected by the type of critical incident. In 78% of critical incidents, the type of comment made before incidents differed to type of comment after the incident, coaches rarely talked at the same time and silence was common. These novel findings are limited to ice hockey coaches given the small sample size. However, these results should encourage more research into the psychophysiological and verbal responses of coaches in other team sports real game situations to better understand in game coaching behaviour. © The Author(s) 2017.",doi,10.1177/1747954117710509,Scopus,International Journal of Sports Science and Coaching,"Kennedy M.D., Knight C.J.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Beta-Adrenergic Receptor Gene Polymorphisms And Cardiovascular Reactivity To Stress In Black Adolescents And Young Adults,"Cardiovascular reactivity to stress and β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) function may contribute to the development of hypertension. As Black Americans have an increased risk of hypertension, we evaluated associations between β1-AR (Arg389Gly) and β2-AR (Arg16Gly, Gln27Glu) gene variants and cardiovascular reactivity in 500 Black youth. Heart rate, preejection period, total peripheral resistance, and blood pressure reactivity were measured during cold and psychological stress. The Arg389Gly polymorphism in the β1-AR was associated with preejection period reactivity in males but not in females. The Arg16Gly polymorphism in the β2-AR was associated with diastolic blood pressure reactivity only during video game stress. An association between the Gln27Glu polymorphism in the β2-AR and vascular reactivity depended on sex. Thus, specific patterns of associations emerged between genetic variations in β-ARs and cardiovascular reactivity in young Blacks.

Preparing the partner is an integral step to making sure that the mother is well-supported in her birth. Because the mother's experience is influenced by the support she receives, and because birth partners need more support than is recognized, the author targets birth partners with a learning intervention. The author investigates video games as a vehicle for knowledge transfer to the birth partner, both as currently available and as a positive learning tool. To address the problem of limited access to childbirth preparation methods, especially for under-served Californians, the author investigated, designed, created, and evaluated two tools: The Prepared Partner and Digital Birth. The Prepared Partner is an online Flash game, and Digital Birth is a free iPhone application that is still undergoing revision and testing. Both games allow the user to practice various supportive actions in the realm of childbirth support for a mother in labor. The author found that players met the learning goals due to The Prepared Partner, and answered positively on the survey questions about their enjoyment of the game.

,Beyond Entertainment,"The percentage of older adults who are active gamers has increased tremendously in recent years. Although research shows that video games enhance physical and cognitive well-being in older adults, the role of video games in enhancing social interactions has been relatively understudied. We examined the habits, preferences, motivations, and outcomes of video gameplay among older and younger adults who play games with their family members. The findings reveal that sharing in video games does foster relationships and connections while producing positive emotions for both generations. As a consequence, game designers should take into consideration ways to enhance these social aspects of gameplay. © The Author(s) 2015.",doi,10.1177/1555412015602819,Scopus,Games and Culture,"Osmanovic S., Pecchioni L., Prof.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Beyond The Shooter Game: Examining Presence And Hostile Outcomes Among Male Game Players.,"Investigating male game players, this study explores how game interface (virtual reality [VR] and standard console), game content (fighting, shooting, and driving), and game context (human and computer competition) influence levels of presence and hostile expectation bias—the expectation others will think, feel, speak, and act aggressively during social conflict. In addition to game interface and game content influencing hostile expectations, significant interactions were detected for hostile expectations. Presence, although not as predicted, also significantly differed across game interface and game content. Through the development and testing of each gaming experience, this study demonstrates that simply testing violent and nonviolent game situations underestimates the complexity of contemporary video-game play.",doi,10.1177/0093650206293249,anderson2010,Communication Research,"Eastin, M.

,Biomimetic Control Architecture For Robotic Cooperative Tasks,"This article proposes some control algorithms to be applied to the MIROSOT robot league architecture. The MIROSOT league soccer game concept is fairly simple: two teams of robots, with 3-5 robots per side, play football autonomously. The ball that the teams play with is an orange golf ball. Above the pitch is a machine vision camera running at 60 frames per second. This camera is linked to a server, which calculates the positions and velocities of each of the robots and the ball, and then determines what each robot should be doing. These instructions are then communicated to the robots over wireless links. In order to develop an efficient control strategy and architecture, the robots have to use strategies from the real human soccer game. Using the software Simi Scout, a suitable analysis of tactics can be extracted from the games. After analyzing the soccer game, a number of attributes are specified and then embedded at different levels. The specified attributes are interconnected, and the analysis of the game is processed for optimization. Using this information, the robot program is adapted and experimental tests/games are played. We comment on the results, and propose an improved control architecture based on practical results. © 2010 International Symposium on Artificial Life and Robotics (ISAROB).",doi,10.1007/s10015-010-0830-7,Scopus,Artificial Life and Robotics,"Bizdoaca N.G., Hamdan H., Coman D., Hamdan M., Al Mutib K.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Blood Pressure Changes During The Game Of Squash,"The extent and pattern of the blood pressure response to the playing of squash was studied in five healthy volunteers using intra-arterial blood pressure recordings. Systolic pressure increased more than diastolic, but by only 18% of basal, peaking 5.2 ± 2.3 min into the game (mean game duration 49 ±4 min). Thereafter there was a progressive decline, with reducing pulse pressure towards basal. There was a marked and significant increase in beat-by-beat blood pressure variability (P&lt;0.01) and systolic peaks of up to 200mmHg were recorded. A peak heart rate of 171 ±25 beats min-1 occurred at 20 min. These findings do not support the concept of a disproportionate and prolonged pressor response induced by playing squash. The possibility of high single-beat systolic peaks still justifies some caution in subjects at risk of arterial rupture. © 1992 The European Society of Cardiology.",doi,10.1093/oxfordjournals.eurheartj.a060318,Scopus,European Heart Journal,"Brigden G.S., Hughes L.O., Broadhurst P., Raftery E.B.",1992,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Blood Pressure Reactivity To Psychological Stress And Coronary Calcification In The Coronary Artery Risk Development In Young Adults Study,"A longstanding hypothesis is that individuals who exhibit large increases in blood pressure during psychological stress are at risk for atherosclerosis. We tested whether blood pressure changes during psychological stress predict subsequent coronary calcification (CaC) in young healthy adults. We evaluated 2816 healthy black and white women, 20 to 35 years of age, from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study, who were not using medication for hypertension or diabetes in 1987-1988. Participants completed video game and star tracing tasks while their blood pressure was recorded. Thirteen years later (2000-2001), they completed computed tomography measures of CaC. Overall 9.3% (261 of 2816) had CaC present at follow-up. Each 10 mm Hg change in systolic blood pressure during the video game was associated with a 24% increased odds of having CaC at follow-up (unadjusted odds ratio, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.46; P=0.008). This association persisted after adjustment for age, race, sex, education, smoking, alcohol, family history of myocardial infarction, smoking, daily alcohol consumption, body mass index, and resting or baseline blood pressure (odds ratio, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.58; P=0.006). Blood pressure changes during the star tracing task were not associated with subsequent CaC. Blood pressure changes during a video game predicted the presence of CaC 13 years later. To our knowledge, this is the first study that reports blood pressure reactivity to a stressor being related to calcification in the coronary arteries. Blood pressure reactivity may provide useful prognostic information about future risk beyond standard risk factors. © 2006 American Heart Association, Inc.",doi,10.1161/01.HYP.0000200713.44895.38,Scopus,Hypertension,"Matthews K.A., Zhu S., Tucker D.C., Whooley M.A.",2006,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Blood Pressure Reactivity To Psychological Stress Predicts Hypertension In The Cardia Study,"Background - A longstanding but controversial hypothesis is that individuals who exhibit frequent, large increases in blood pressure (BP) during psychological stress are at risk for developing essential hypertension. We tested whether BP changes during psychological stress predict incident hypertension in young adults. Methods and Results - We used survival analysis to predict hypertensive status during 13 years of follow-up in a sample of >4100 normotensive black and white men and women (age at entry, 18 to 30 years) enrolled in the CARDIA study. BP responses to 3 psychological challenges - cold pressor, star tracing, and video game tasks - were measured. Hypertensive status was defined as use of antihypertensive medication or measured BP ≥140/90 mm Hg. After adjustment for race, gender, covariates (education, body mass index, age, and resting pressure), and their significant interactions, the larger the BP responses were to each of the 3 tasks, the earlier hypertension occurred (P<0.0001 to <0.01). The systolic BP effect for the cold pressor task was apparent for women and for whites in race- and gender-specific models, whereas the diastolic BP effect for the video game was apparent for men. Conclusions - Young adults who show a large BP response to psychological stress may be at risk for hypertension as they approach midlife.",doi,10.1161/01.CIR.0000133415.37578.E4,Scopus,Circulation,"Matthews K.A., Katholi C.R., McCreath H., Whooley M.A., Williams D.R., Zhu S., Markovitz J.H.",2004,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Body In The Interactive Game: How Interface Embodiment Affects Physical Activity And Health Behavior Change,"Does the delivery platform for a health behavior game contribute to its effectiveness? With the growing popularity of interactive video games that combine physical exercise with gameplay, known as ""exergames,"" there has been a burgeoning interest in their impact on users' exercise attitudes and behavioral outcomes. This study examines how the level of user interface embodiment, the degree to which the user's body interacts with the game, affects the user's experience, game behavior, and intention for behavior change. We conducted a between-participants experiment in which participants (N = 119) played an exergame under one of the three levels of user interface embodiment (low, medium, and high). Our results revealed a significant positive main effect of user interface embodiment on user experience (i.e., the sense of being in the game, ""presence,"" and enjoyment); level of energy expenditure (change in heart rate); and intention to further engage in exergame-play exercise but not necessarily to increase exercise in the physical world. A further analysis revealed the mediating roles of user experience in the association between user interface embodiment and intention to repeat exergaming and a potential link between heart rate change and level of presence in the game. We conclude that type of interface is a key variable in this health communication environment, affecting user experience, behavior, and some intention for behavior change. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The current paper uses video game violence research as an example of how such issues may develop in a field. Despite decades of research, evidence on whether violent video games (VVGs) contribute to aggression in players has remained mixed. Concerns have been raised in recent years that experiments regarding VVGs may suffer from both “false positives” and “false negatives.” The current paper examines this issue in three sets of video game experiments, two sets of video game experiments on aggression and prosocial behaviors identified in meta-analysis, and a third group of recent null studies. Results indicated that studies of VVGs and aggression appear to be particularly prone to false positive results. Studies of VVGs and prosocial behavior, by contrast are heterogeneous and did not demonstrate any indication of false positive results. However, their heterogeneous nature made it difficult to base solid conclusions on them. By contrast, evidence for false negatives in null studies was limited, and little evidence emerged that null studies lacked power in comparison those highlighted in past meta-analyses as evidence for effects.

,Brain Natriuretic Hormone Predicts Stress-Induced Alterations In Diastolic Function,"Background: Mental stress (MS) reduces diastolic function (DF) and may lead to congestive heart failure with preserved systolic function. Whether brain natriuretic hormone (brain natriuretic peptide [BNP]) mediates the relationship of MS with DF is unknown.Methods: One hundred sixty individuals aged 30 to 50 years underwent 2-hour protocol of 40-minute rest, videogame stressor and recovery. Hemodynamics, pro-BNP samples and DF indices were obtained throughout the protocol. Separate regression analyses were conducted using rest and stress E/A, E' and E/E' as dependent variables. Predictor variables were entered into the stepwise regression models in a hierarchical fashion. At the first level, age, sex, race, height, body mass index, pro-BNP and left ventricular mass (LVM) were permitted to enter the models. The second level consisted of systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR). The final level contained cross-product terms of race by SBP, DBP and HR.Results: E/A ratio was lower during stress compared to rest and recovery (P &lt; 0.01). Resting E/A ratio was predicted by a regression model of age (-0.31), pro-BNP (0.16), HR (-0.40) and DBP (-0.23) with an R2 = 0.33. Stress E/A ratio was predicted by age (-0.24), pro-BNP (0.08), HR (-0.38) and SBP (-0.21) with total R2 = 0.22. Resting E' model consisted of age (-0.22), pro-BNP (0.26), DBP (-0.27) and LVM (-0.15) with an R2 = 0.29. Stress E' was predicted by age (-0.18), pro-BNP (0.35) and LVM (-0.18) with an R2 = 0.18. Resting E/E' was predicted by race (0.17, B. W) and DBP (0.24) with an R2 = 0.10. Stress E/E' consisted of pro-BNP (-0.36), height (-0.26) and HR (-0.21) with an R2 = 0.15.Conclusions: pro-BNP predicts both resting and stress DF, suggesting that lower BNP during MS may be a marker of diastolic dysfunction in apparently healthy individuals. © 2014 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",doi,10.1097/MAJ.0000000000000261,Scopus,American Journal of the Medical Sciences,"Choksy P., Davis H.C., Januzzi J., Thayer J., Harshfield G., Robinson V.J.B., Kapuku G.K.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,"Brain Training For Silver Gamers: Effects Of Age And Game Form On Effectiveness, Efficiency, Self-Assessment, And Gameplay Experience","In recent years, an aging demographic majority in the Western world has come to the attention of the game industry. The recently released ""brain-training"" games target this population, and research investigating gameplay experience of the elderly using this game form is lacking. This study employs a 2× 2 mixed factorial design (age group: young and old× game form: paper and Nintendo DS) to investigate effects of age and game form on usability, self-assessment, and gameplay experience in a supervised field study. Effectiveness was evaluated in task completion time, efficiency as error rate, together with self-assessment measures (arousal, pleasure, dominance) and game experience (challenge, flow, competence, tension, positive and negative affect). Results indicate players, regardless of age, are more effective and efficient using pen-and-paper than using a Nintendo DS console. However, the game is more arousing and induces a heightened sense of flow in digital form for gamers of all ages. Logic problem-solving challenges within digital games may be associated with positive feelings for the elderly but with negative feelings for the young. Thus, digital logic-training games may provide positive gameplay experience for an aging Western civilization. © 2009, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",doi,10.1089/cpb.2009.0013,Scopus,Cyberpsychology and Behavior,"Nacke L.E., Nacke A., Lindley C.A.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Brand Logo Placements In Violent Games: Effects Of Violence Cues On Memory And Attitude Through Arousal And Presence,"With the general aggression model and presence (i.e., sense of ""being there"") theory as frameworks, this study investigates the effects of violence cues (blood and screams of pain) and players' individual differences in aggression (trait aggression) on brand logo memory and on attitude change in a violent first-person shooter game (Half-Life 2). Physiological arousal (skin conductance levels) was assessed during game play and participants reported their sense of presence in the game. Results indicate that violence cues influence brand logo memory through engagement and affect attitude change via arousal. Although physiological arousal led to positive change in brand attitude, it does not significantly influence logo memory. Conversely, although higher levels of spatial presence led to better logo memory, there was a corresponding reduction in attitude change for highly recognized brands. We consider the possibility that increased memory but negative attitude change with higher presence in violent video games could deter advertisers from placing their messages inside violent games. © 2011 American Academy of Advertising.

,Building A Pedagogy Around Action And Emotion: Experiences Of Blind Opera Of Kolkata,"Contemporary knowledge systems have given too much importance to visual symbols, the written word for instance, as the repository of knowledge. The primacy of the written word and the representational world built around it is, however, under debate - especially from recent insights derived from cognitive science that seeks to bring back action, intent and emotion within the core of cognitive science (Freeman and Nunez in J Consciousness Stud 6(11/12), 1999). It is being argued that other sensory experiences, apart from the visual, along with desires (or intent) and emotions - like pain, pleasure, sorrow or joy - constitute equally important building blocks that shape an individual's cognition of the world around. This multi-sensory cognition colored by emotions inspire action and hence is valid knowledge. This is probably nowhere more apparent than in the world of the visually impaired. Deprived of visual sensory capability, they have to perforce depend on other senses. But the dominant discourse in wider society plays a major role in determining what they (the blind) can do. A society built around visual symbols and the written word underplays other elements of cognition and in the process undervalues them. This also gets reflected in the construction of social artifacts of various kinds, such as the educational certification system (The Braille system is an attempt to make the written world accessible to the blind through tactile signals'so that words are 'felt' and 'read'. But it is quite cumbersome. For instance, even a blind highly skilled at writing in Braille would not be able to match the writing speed of an ordinary visually endowed literate person. Effective and efficient computer-based voice'text'voice converters might solve this problem better.)-based primarily on skills over the written word. Linguistic ability becomes most valuable and at another level the written word gets salience over the spoken word. The blind hardly has a chance, therefore, except through concessions or piety. A practice built around the imagery of an empowered blind person, therefore, must depart from mainstream conceptualization - for power is derived from what one has rather than from what one lacks. It must begin by tapping and valorizing one's own endowments. This paper is an attempt to identify such a departure based on the experience of Blind Opera - a theatre group of the blind working in Kolkata, India. It seeks to provide an exposition in written word of an experience that can only be partially captured within the confines of a text. It is an incomplete account, therefore, and may be taken as an attempt to reach out and seek an exchange of experiences and insights. © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2006.",doi,10.1007/s00146-006-0038-5,Scopus,AI and Society,"Saha B., Gangopadhyay S.",2007,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Can A Virtual Patient Trainer Teach Student Nurses How To Save Lives-Teaching Nursing Students About Pediatric Respiratory Diseases,"Introduction: Virtual environments offer a variety of benefits and may be a powerful medium with which to provide nursing education. The objective of this study was to compare the achievement of learning outcomes of undergraduate nursing students when a virtual patient trainer or a traditional lecture was used to teach pediatric respiratory content. Methods: This was a randomized, controlled, posttest design. A virtual pediatric hospital unit was populated with four virtual pediatric patients having different respiratory diseases that were designed to meet the same learning objectives as a traditional lecture. The study began in Spring 2010 with 93 Senior I, baccalaureate nursing students. Students were randomized to receive either a traditional lecture or an experience with a virtual patient trainer. Students' knowledge acquisition was evaluated using multiple-choice questions, and knowledge application was measured as timeliness of care in two simulated clinical scenarios using high-fidelity mannequins and standardized patients. Results: Ninety-three students participated in the study, of which 46 were in the experimental group that received content using the virtual patient trainer. After the intervention, students in the experimental group had significantly higher knowledge acquisition (P = 0.004) and better knowledge application (P = 0.001) for each of the two scenarios than students in the control group. Conclusions: The purpose of this project was to compare a virtual patient trainer to a traditional lecture for the achievement of learning outcomes for pediatric respiratory content. Although the virtual patient trainer experience produced statistically better outcomes, the differences may not be clinically significant. The results suggest that a virtual patient trainer may be an effective substitute for the achievement of learning outcomes that are typically met using a traditional lecture format. Further research is needed to understand how best to integrate a virtual patient trainer into undergraduate nursing education.

,Can Interface Features Affect Aggression Resulting From Violent Video Game Play? An Examination Of Realistic Controller And Large Screen Size,"Aggressiveness attributed to violent video game play is typically studied as a function of the content features of the game. However, can interface features of the game also affect aggression? Guided by the General Aggression Model (GAM), we examine the controller type (gun replica vs. mouse) and screen size (large vs. small) as key technological aspects that may affect the state aggression of gamers, with spatial presence and arousal as potential mediators. Results from a between-subjects experiment showed that a realistic controller and a large screen display induced greater aggression, presence, and arousal than a conventional mouse and a small screen display, respectively, and confirmed that trait aggression was a significant predictor of gamers' state aggression. Contrary to GAM, however, arousal showed no effects on aggression; instead, presence emerged as a significant mediator. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2013.",doi,10.1089/cyber.2012.0500,Scopus,"Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking","Kim K.J., Sundar S.S.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Can Video Games Enhance Creativity? Effects Of Emotion Generated By Dance Dance Revolution,"What role does emotion play in helping youth reach their creative potential? Does it alter how they process ideas, and how many ideas they can generate? By varying the levels of arousal associated with low, medium, and high levels of exertion in the video game Dance Dance Revolution, and inducing a positive or negative mood, this study offers evidence that emotion significantly affects creativity through the interaction of arousal and valence. Faced with the cognitive demand of creativity, lower arousal levels resulted in higher creativity scores when coupled with a negative mood. At high arousal levels, a positive mood resulted in greater creative potential than a negative mood. These results are discussed here in light of theories of emotion as a prime, as information, and as a moderator of attention. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",doi,10.1080/10400419.2010.503540,Scopus,Creativity Research Journal,"Hutton E., Sundar S.S.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,"Carbohydrate Gel Ingestion Significantly Improves The Intermittent Endurance Capacity, But Not Sprint Performance, Of Adolescent Team Games Players During A Simulated Team Games Protocol","The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of ingesting a carbohydrate (CHO) gel on the intermittent endurance capacity and sprint performance of adolescent team games players. Eleven participants [mean age 13.5 ± 0.7 years, height 1.72 ± 0.08 m, body mass (BM) 62.1 ± 9.4 kg] performed two trials separated by 3-7 days. In each trial, they completed four 15 min periods of part A of the Loughborough Intermittent Shuttle Test (LIST), followed by an intermittent run to exhaustion (part B). In the 5 min pre-exercise, participants consumed 0.818 mL kg -1 BM of a CHO or a non-CHO placebo gel, and a further 0.327 mL kg -1 BM every 15 min during part A of the LIST (38.0 ± 5.5 g CHO h -1 in the CHO trial). Intermittent endurance capacity was increased by 21.1% during part B when the CHO gel was ingested (4.6 ± 2.0 vs. 3.8 ± 2.4 min, P &lt; 0.05, r = 0.67), with distance covered in part B significantly greater in the CHO trial (787 ± 319 vs. 669 ± 424 m, P &lt; 0.05, r = 0.57). Gel ingestion did not significantly influence mean 15 m sprint time (P = 0.34), peak sprint time (P = 0.81), or heart rate (P = 0.66).

,Cardiorespiratory Exertion While Playing Video Game Exercises In Elderly Individuals With Type 2 Diabetes,"Objective: To evaluate the suitability of the Wii Fit Plus exergame as a tool to improve cardiorespiratory fitness in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Design: Experimental cross-sectional study. Setting: Controlled laboratory. Participants: Twelve type 2 diabetic patients (10 male and 2 female; age, 60.2 ± 7.7 years; body mass index, 30.9 ± 6.2 kg/m2). Interventions: At baseline, all participants underwent an all-out cardiopulmonary exercise test on a treadmill to assess peak and average oxygen consumption (Vo2 peak and Vo2 mean). Forty-eight to 72 hours after the cardiopulmonary exercise test, the same parameters were assessed during three 10-minute bouts of Wii Fit Plus exergaming and converted to percentage of treadmill Vo2 peak (%Vo2 peak). Main Outcome Measures: Vo2 peak and Vo2 mean during Wii Fit Plus play relative to Vo2 peak achieved during the cardiopulmonary exercise test. Results: All Wii Fit Plus exercises generated a Vo2 peak of around 60% and Vo2 mean of around 40% of the Vo2 peak as established during the cardiopulmonary exercise test. Mean heart rate and resting energy expenditure (respiratory exchange ratio) lay in a range of moderate aerobic exercise. A moderate-to-strong correlation between treadmill Vo2 peak and both exergame Vo2 peak and exergame Vo2 mean was found. Conclusions: Video gaming has the potential to offer training intensities that concur with established guidelines for type 2 diabetic patients. The training intensity is self-adjusting based on fitness level allowing for an effective workout for different users. Copyright © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

,Casual Games With A Pervasive Twist,"In this paper we present proposals for including real world elements in games taking into account the profile of casual players. Several real world elements can be utilized so that the fictional game world merges with reality. We focused on sound, video, physiological data, accelerometer data, weather and the player's location. From our experience developing and testing casual games, resulted a set of guidelines that address technological requirements on the player side. These guidelines may be of use for other researchers and developers in order to better adapt games to their audience. By resorting to real world elements, the screen no longer is the only focus of the player's attention because reality also influences the outcome of the game. Results are presented about how the insertion of real world elements affected the role of the screen as the primary focus of the player's attention. Positive results, in what regards defeating the screen, were obtained, mainly, with sound, the electrodermal activity and the accelerometer for these elements were used in such a way that the player's daily activities became part of the game. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",doi,10.1016/j.entcom.2014.03.003,Scopus,Entertainment Computing,"Reis S., Correia N.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Challenging The Other: Exploring The Role Of Opponent Gender In Digital Game Competition For Female Players,"The present study investigated the effect of opponent gender on the game experience of female players. Concretely, it looked into skill perception and player emotions of women in same gender and cross-gender game competition. We set up a 2×2×2 (male vs. female opponent×low vs. high competitive women×lost vs. won game) experimental design in which women were instructed to play against a proclaimed male and female competitor. Unknowingly, however, participants played against an AI, which was configured to produce a winning and a losing condition for each opponent by manipulating difficulty. Results indicated that opponent gender only had an effect on perceived stress, which was higher with male opponents. Moreover, players evaluated their own gaming skills as lower and the skills of presumed male opponents as higher when they thought they were playing against men. Importantly, our results also showed that the above described pattern for self-perceived skills and perceived opponent skills was modulated by trait competitiveness with a larger effect size for low competitive women. Overall, this study illustrates that gender dynamics affect the play experience of women in cross-gender gaming competition. Implications and suggestions for future research are discussed. © Copyright 2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2014.",doi,10.1089/cyber.2013.0331,Scopus,"Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking","Vermeulen L., Núñez Castellar E., Van Looy J.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali

In the current study, men and women were randomly assigned to experience a series of victories or defeats, after which aggressive behaviour was assessed using a well-validated behavioural measure. Winning produced elevated testosterone concentrations relative to losing in men, but not women. More importantly, testosterone reactivity to competition mediated the effect of winning on subsequent aggressive behaviour in men, but not women. We discuss limitations of the current study (e.g., the status manipulation may have affected other variables not measured in the study including competitiveness and physical activity expended), as well as discuss a potential neural mechanism underlying the effect of testosterone reactivity on aggressive behaviour. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.psyneuen.2013.03.008,Scopus,Psychoneuroendocrinology,"Carré J.M., Campbell J.A., Lozoya E., Goetz S.M.M., Welker K.M.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Children's Cardiovascular Reactivity: Stability Of Racial Differences And Relation To Subsequent Blood Pressure Over A One‐Year Period,"After measuring blood pressure and heart rate at rest and during a video game procedure in 477 children enrolled in 3rd grade, 434 (91%) children had these measurements repeated a year later in 4th grade. Black children demonstrated greater blood pressure and heart rate reactivity than White children in both years, and an increase in heart rate reactivity from 3rd to 4th grade. Gender effects were inconsistent. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures during the video game were more highly correlated from year‐to‐year than were the resting measures. Regression analysis indicated that systolic reactivity was significantly related to subsequent systolic pressure at rest, particularly among Black girls. Diastolic reactivity was associated with subsequent resting diastolic pressure only among White children. Associations between reactivity and future blood pressure were independent of initial resting blood pressure. This study suggests that cardiovascular reactivity to psychological stress may be one important factor in future level of blood pressure and that the increased heart rate reactivity of Black children may be associated with the prevalence of hypertension among Black adults.

,Children's Spontaneous Emotional Expressions While Receiving (Un)Wanted Prizes In The Presence Of Peers.,"Although current emotion theories emphasize the importance of contextual factors for emotional expressive behavior, developmental studies that examine such factors are currently thin on the ground. In this research, we studied the course of emotional expressions of 8- and 11-year-old children after winning a (large) first prize or a (substantially smaller) consolation prize, while playing a game competing against the computer or a physically co-present peer. We analyzed their emotional reactions by conducting two perception tests in which participants rated children's level of happiness. Results showed that co-presence positively affected children's happiness only when receiving the first prize. Moreover, for children who were in the presence of a peer, we found that eye contact affected children's expressions of happiness, but that the effect was different for different age groups: 8-year-old children were negatively affected, and 11-year-old children positively. Overall, we can conclude that as children grow older and their social awareness increases, the presence of a peer affects their non-verbal expressions, regardless of their appreciation of their prize.",doi,10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01401,pubmed,Frontiers in psychology,"Visser, Mandy; Krahmer, Emiel; Swerts, Marc",2015,NA,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Choking On The Money: Reward-Based Performance Decrements Are Associated With Midbrain Activity,"A pernicious paradox in human motivation is the occasional reduced performance associated with tasks and situations that involve larger-than-average rewards. Three broad explanations that might account for such performance decrements are attentional competition (distraction theories), inhibition by conscious processes (explicit-monitoring theories), and excessive drive and arousal (overmotivation theories). Here, we report incentive-dependent performance decrements in humans in a reward-pursuit task; subjects were less successful in capturing a more valuable reward in a computerized maze. Concurrent functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed that increased activity in ventral midbrain, a brain area associated with incentive motivation and basic reward responding, correlated with both reduced number of captures and increased number of near-misses associated with imminent high rewards. These data cast light on the neurobiological basis of choking under pressure and are consistent with overmotivation accounts. © 2009 Association for Psychological Science.",doi,10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02399.x,Scopus,Psychological Science,"Mobbs D., Hassabis D., Seymour B., Marchant J.L., Weiskopf N., Dolan R.J., Frith C.D.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Chronic Violent Video Game Exposure And Desensitization To Violence: Behavioral And Event-Related Brain Potential Data.,"Numerous studies have shown that exposure to media violence increases aggression, though the mechanisms of this effect have remained elusive. One theory posits that repeated exposure to media violence desensitizes viewers to real world violence, increasing aggression by blunting aversive reactions to violence and removing normal inhibitions against aggression. Theoretically, violence desensitization should be reflected in the amplitude of the P300 component of the event-related brain potential (ERP), which has been associated with activation of the aversive motivational system. In the current study, violent images elicited reduced P300 amplitudes among violent, as compared to nonviolent video game players. Additionally, this reduced brain response predicted increased aggressive behavior in a later task. Moreover, these effects held after controlling for individual differences in trait aggressiveness. These data are the first to link media violence exposure and aggressive behavior to brain processes hypothetically associated with desensitization.",doi,10.1016/j.jesp.2005.08.006,anderson2010,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,"Bartholow, B.

,Coalition-Based Resource Negotiation For Multimedia Applications In Informationally Decentralized Networks,"Designing efficient and fair solutions for dividing the network resources in a distributed manner among self-interested multimedia users is recently becoming an important research topic because heterogeneous and high bandwidth multimedia applications (users), having different quality-of-service requirements, are sharing the same network. Suitable resource negotiation solutions need to explicitly consider the amount of information exchanged among the users and the computational complexity incurred by the users. In this paper, we propose decentralized solutions for resource negotiation, where multiple autonomous users self-organize into a coalition which shares the same network resources and negotiate the division of these resources by exchanging information about their requirements. We then discuss various resource sharing strategies that the users can deploy based on their exchanged information. Several of these strategies are designed to explicitly consider the utility (i.e., video quality) impact of multimedia applications. In order to quantify the utility benefit derived by exchanging different information, we define a new metric, which we refer to as the value of information. We quantify through simulations the improvements that can be achieved when various information is exchanged between users, and discuss the required complexity at the user side involved in implementing the various resource negotiation strategies. © 2009 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TMM.2009.2017638,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Multimedia,"Park H., Van Der Schaar M.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Collaborative Virtual Reality Based Advanced Cardiac Life Support Training Simulator Using Virtual Reality Principles,"Background: Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) is a series of team-based, sequential and time constrained interventions, requiring effective communication and coordination of activities that are performed by the care provider team on a patient undergoing cardiac arrest or respiratory failure. The state-of-the-art ACLS training is conducted in a face-to-face environment under expert supervision and suffers from several drawbacks including conflicting care provider schedules and high cost of training equipment. Objective: The major objective of the study is to describe, including the design, implementation, and evaluation of a novel approach of delivering ACLS training to care providers using the proposed virtual reality simulator that can overcome the challenges and drawbacks imposed by the traditional face-to-face training method. Methods: We compare the efficacy and performance outcomes associated with traditional ACLS training with the proposed novel approach of using a virtual reality (VR) based ACLS training simulator. One hundred and forty-eight (148) ACLS certified clinicians, translating into 26 care provider teams, were enrolled for this study. Each team was randomly assigned to one of the three treatment groups: control (traditional ACLS training), persuasive (VR ACLS training with comprehensive feedback components), or minimally persuasive (VR ACLS training with limited feedback components). The teams were tested across two different ACLS procedures that vary in the degree of task complexity: ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia (VFib/VTach) and pulseless electric activity (PEA). Results: The difference in performance between control and persuasive groups was not statistically significant (P= .37 for PEA and P= .1 for VFib/VTach). However, the difference in performance between control and minimally persuasive groups was significant (P= .05 for PEA and P= .02 for VFib/VTach). The pre-post comparison of performances of the groups showed that control (P= .017 for PEA, P= .01 for VFib/VTach) and persuasive (P= .02 for PEA, P= .048 for VFib/VTach) groups improved their performances significantly, whereas minimally persuasive group did not (P= .45 for PEA, P= .46 for VFib/VTach). Results also suggest that the benefit of persuasiveness is constrained by the potentially interruptive nature of these features. Conclusions: Our results indicate that the VR-based ACLS training with proper feedback components can provide a learning experience similar to face-to-face training, and therefore could serve as a more easily accessed supplementary training tool to the traditional ACLS training. Our findings also suggest that the degree of persuasive features in VR environments have to be designed considering the interruptive nature of the feedback elements. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",doi,10.1016/j.jbi.2014.04.005,Scopus,Journal of Biomedical Informatics,"Khanal P., Vankipuram A., Ashby A., Vankipuram M., Gupta A., Drumm-Gurnee D., Josey K., Tinker L., Smith M.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Comparative Characteristics Of Psychophysiological Indicators In The Representatives Of Cyclic And Game Sports,"The aim of the work is to determine the characteristics of the speed of reaction in representatives of cyclic sports (swimmers) in comparison with representatives of game sports (basketball players) and to reveal the differences in the speed of simple and complex reactions in swimmers and basketball players of different qualifications. Material and methods. In this study, methods were used to determine the psychophysiological abilities of athletes in terms of time indicators of a simple and complex reaction. Tests were conducted on the computer program ""Psychodiagnostics"". The following measurements were made: measurement of the simple reaction rate of the light stimulus; measurement of the simple reaction rate to the sound stimulus; the measurement of the complex reaction of choosing one of three objects; the measurement of the complex reaction of selecting two objects from three; in response to the appearance on the monitor screen of the animal's image should be as soon as possible to press and release the right mouse button. In the study to determine the differences between the reaction rate indicators, swimmers and basketball players were attended by 22 qualified swimmers and 24 qualified basketball players. In determining the comparative evaluation of the indicators of psycho-physiological functions of swimmers of different qualifications, 6 masters of sports and masters of sports of international class in swimming and 10 athletes of the 1st category and candidates for master of sports were used. In determining the comparative evaluation of the indicators of psycho-physiological functions of basketball players of various qualifications, 11 sports masters (athletes of international level) in basketball and 12 athletes of the 1st category and candidates for the master of sports (athletes of regional level) were tested. Results. On the indicators of psycho-physiological testing revealed significant differences between basketball players and swimmers. Qualified basketball players have significantly less time for a simple reaction to a light stimulus, for a sound stimulus, the response time for selecting one element out of three, and the response time for selecting two elements out of three. In swimmers, the time of simple reaction to the light stimulus and the reaction time to the auditory stimulus decrease as the skill level increases. The time of a complex selection reaction is not significantly different in swimmers of different qualifications. This testifies to the importance of psychophysiological abilities not only for representatives of game sports, but also for cyclical ones, for example, for swimming. Basketball players of higher qualification (masters of sports) significantly less time of both simple and complex reactions in comparison with basketball players of the 1st category and candidates for the master of sports. Conclusions. It has been revealed that, in almost all indicators of psychophysiological functions, basketball players are significantly different from swimmers in fins. With the improvement of the swimmers' skills, the time of simple reactions decreases. Basketball players with higher qualifications have less time for simple and complex reactions. © JPES.",doi,10.7752/jpes.2017.02097,Scopus,Journal of Physical Education and Sport,"Kozina Z., Prusik K., Görner K., Sobko I., Repko O., Bazilyuk T., Kostiukevych V., Goncharenko V., Galan Y., Goncharenko O., Korol S., Korol S.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Comparing Real-Time And Incremental Heuristic Search For Real-Time Situated Agents,"Real-time situated agents, such as characters in real-time computer games, often do not know the terrain in advance but automatically observe it within a certain range around themselves. They have to interleave searches with action executions to make the searches tractable when moving autonomously to user-specified coordinates. The searches face real-time requirements since it is important that the agents be responsive to the commands of the users and move smoothly. In this article, we compare two classes of fast heuristic search methods for these navigation tasks that speed up A*searches in different ways, namely real-time heuristic search and incremental heuristic search, to understand their advantages and disadvantages and make recommendations about when each one should be used. We first develop a competitive real-time heuristic search method. LSS-LRTA*is a version of Learning Real-Time A*that uses A*to determine its local search spaces and learns quickly. We analyze the properties of LSS-LRTA*and then compare it experimentally against the state-of-the-art incremental heuristic search method D*Lite on our navigation tasks, for which D*Lite was specifically developed, resulting in the first comparison of real-time and incremental heuristic search in the literature. We characterize when to choose each one of the two heuristic search methods, depending on the search objective and the kind of terrain. Our experimental results show that LSS-LRTA*can outperform D*Lite under the right conditions, namely when there is time pressure or the user-supplied h-values are generally not misleading. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",doi,10.1007/s10458-008-9061-x,Scopus,Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems,"Koenig S., Sun X.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Comparing The Effects Of Real Versus Simulated Violence On Dream Imagery,"Participants in the current study were 75 males, including 25 Canadian soldiers, 25 heavy gamers who play military based video games such as ""Call of Duty,"" and a control group comprised of 25 males. One dream per participant was analyzed using Hall and Van de Castle content analysis guidelines, including aggression, threat, and previously established scales for intensity of aggression and emotion. The dreams of soldiers had a higher frequency of both aggression and threat, and were also more intense in aggression and emotion than both the heavy gamers and the controls. These findings suggest that exposure to real life violence and threat (as well as the emotional significance of the experience) is more frequently incorporated into dream imagery than simulated or virtual threat. Limitations and directions for future studies are discussed. © Copyright 2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2014.",doi,10.1089/cyber.2013.0494,Scopus,"Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking","Dale A., Murkar A., Miller N., Black J.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Comparison Of Good Days And Sick Days Of School-Age Children With Cancer Reflected Through Their Drawings,"Purpose: Childhood cancer disrupts children’s daily life experiences. Eliciting children’s perspectives regarding their life experiences during cancer treatment can be challenging. The purpose of this study was to characterize elementary school-age children’s “good days” and “sick days” through their drawings. Methods: This study used draw-and-tell interviews, a developmentally sensitive arts-based technique that supports children’s recall and communication of information, facilitating a deeper understanding of children’s personal interpretation and meaning of a given phenomenon of interest. Children were asked to draw pictures representing both a “good day” and a “sick day.” Following completion of each drawing, research team members used a semi-structured interview guide to elicit children’s explanations of their pictures. Content analysis techniques were used to descriptively characterize children’s drawings followed by thematic analysis to identify commonalities. Results: Participants were 27 children 6.33–12.83 years of age (mean 9.16 years; SD = 1.9) receiving treatment for cancer. “Good day” and “sick day” pictures were similar with regards to the presence of the child, the inclusion of other individuals, and the type of art medium used. Children’s pictures characterized “good days” as being happy, outside in sunny weather, and engaged in activities. In contrast, “sick days” were characterized as feeling sad, lying down or reclining, and experiencing illness-related symptoms. Conclusions: Children’s drawings illustrate their capacity to provide rich personal data related to their “good days” and “sick days.” Incorporating arts-based strategies in the clinical setting may provide a child-centric strategy to understand the child’s perspective and direct interventions. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",doi,10.1007/s11136-017-1621-6,Scopus,Quality of Life Research,"Linder L.A., Bratton H., Nguyen A., Parker K., Phinney S.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Complete Axiomatization And Decidability Of Alternating-Time Temporal Logic,"Alternating-time Temporal Logic (ATL), introduced by Alur, Henzinger and Kupferman, is a logical formalism for the specification and verification of open systems involving multiple autonomous players (agents, components). In particular, this logic allows for the explicit expression of coalition abilities in such systems, modelled as infinite transition games between the coalition and its complement. Formally, ATL is a non-normal multi-modal extension of CTL (regarded as a one-player fragment of ATL) with temporal operators indexed by coalitions of players, and thus expressing selective quantification over those paths which can be effected as outcomes of infinite transition games between the coalition and its complement. We present a sound and complete axiomatization of the logic ATL, based on Pauly's axiomatization of his Coalition Logic, augmented with axioms and rules for fixed point formulae characterizing the temporal operators. The completeness proof is by construction of a bounded branching tree model for each ATL-consistent formula. These models can be folded into finite models, thus rendering the finite model property for ATL. We also describe an automata-based decision procedure for ATL by translating the satisfiability problem to the nonemptiness problem for alternating automata on infinite trees. When considering formulae over a fixed finite set of players the decidability problem is shown to be EXPTIME-complete. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

,"Component Neural Systems For The Creation Of Emotional Memories During Free Viewing Of A Complex, Real-World Event","To investigate the neural systems that contribute to the formation of complex, self-relevant emotional memories, dedicated fans of rival college basketball teams watched a competitive game while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). During a subsequent recognition memory task, participants were shown video clips depicting plays of the game, stemming either from previously-viewed game segments (targets) or from non-viewed portions of the same game (foils). After an old-new judgment, participants provided emotional valence and intensity ratings of the clips. A data driven approach was first used to decompose the fMRI signal acquired during free viewing of the game into spatially independent components. Correlations were then calculated between the identified components and post-scanning emotion ratings for successfully encoded targets. Two components were correlated with intensity ratings, including temporal lobe regions implicated in memory and emotional functions, such as the hippocampus and amygdala, as well as a midline fronto-cingulo-parietal network implicated in social cognition and self-relevant processing. These data were supported by a general linear model analysis, which revealed additional valence effects in fronto-striatal-insular regions when plays were divided into positive and negative events according to the fan's perspective. Overall, these findings contribute to our understanding of how emotional factors impact distributed neural systems to successfully encode dynamic, personally-relevant event sequences. © 2010 Forstmann, Brown, Dutilh, Neumann and Wagenmakers.",doi,10.3389/fnhum.2010.00034,Scopus,Frontiers in Human Neuroscience,"Botzung A., LaBar K.S., Kragel P., Miles A., Rubin D.C.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Computational Psychometrics In Communication And Implications In Decision Making,"Recent investigations emphasized the role of communication features on behavioral trust and reciprocity in economic decision making but no studies have been focused on the effect of communication on affective states in such a context. Thanks to advanced methods of computational psychometrics, in this study, affective states were deeply examined using simultaneous and synchronized recordings of gazes and psychophysiological signals in 28 female students during an investment game. Results showed that participants experienced different affective states according to the type of communication (personal versus impersonal). In particular, participants involved in personal communication felt more relaxed than participants involved in impersonal communication. Moreover, personal communication influenced reciprocity and participants' perceptions about trust and reciprocity. Findings were interpreted in the light of the Arousal/Valence Model and self-disclosure process. © 2015 Pietro Cipresso et al.",doi,10.1155/2015/985032,Scopus,Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine,"Cipresso P., Villani D., Repetto C., Bosone L., Balgera A., Mauri M., Villamira M., Antonietti A., Riva G.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,"Computing, Research, And War: If Knowledge Is Power, Where Is Responsibility?","In the United States, artificial intelligence 1989 research is mainly a story about military support for the development of promising technologies. Since the late 1950s and early 196Os, AI research has received most of its support from the military research establishment [37, 55].1 Not until the 1980s, however, has the military connected this research to specific objectives and products. In 1983, the 600-million Strategic Computing Program (SCP) created three applications for 'pulling' the technology-generation process by creating carefully selected technology interactions with challenging military applications [16]. These applications, an autonomous land vehicle, a pilot's associate, and a battle management system, explicitly connect the three armed services to further AI developments [29, 51, 53]. The Defense Science Board Task Force on the Military Applications of New-Generation Computer Technologies recommended warfare simulation, electronic warfare, ballistic missile defense and logistics management as also promising a high military payoff [18]. In his 1983 Star Wars speech, President Reagan enjoined the scientific community, those who gave us nuclear weapons, to give us the means of rendering these nuclear weapons impotent and obsolete [43]. As in the Manhattan and hydrogen bomb projects, AI researchers and more generally computer scientists are expected to play major parts in this quest for a defensive shield against ballistic missiles. Computing specialists such as John von Neumann played a supportive role by setting up the computations necessary for these engineering feats—with human computers for the atom bomb [10]2 and with ENIAC and other early computers for the hydrogen bomb [9]. The Star Wars project challenges computer scientists to design an intelligent system that finds and destroys targets—basically in real-time and without human intervention. The interdependence of the military and computer science rarely surfaces during our education as computer practitioners, researchers, and teachers. Where might information concerning these important military applications enter into computer science and AI education? Where do students receive information concerning the important role they may play in weapon systems development? One of our students recently remarked that as a computer science major, I did not realize the magnitude of the ramifications of advancing technology for the military. In a field so dominated by the DoD, I will have to think seriously about what I am willing and not willing to do—and what lies in between those two poles.3 As researchers and educators, the authors wish to encourage colleagues and students to reflect upon present and historical interactions between computer science as an academic discipline and profession, and military projects and funding. As computer professionals, we lay claim to specialized knowledge and employ that knowledge in society as developers of computing technologies. Thus, we exercise power. Recognizing that as professionals we wield power, we must also recognize that we have responsibilities to society. To act responsibly does not mean that computer professionals should advocate a complete separation between computer science and military missions. However, we should openly examine the inter-relationships between the military and the discipline and practice of computing. To act responsibly does not mean that computer scientists and practioners should eschew support or employment from the military, although some are justified in taking such a stance.4 To act responsibly requires attention to the social and political context in which one is embedded; it requires reflection upon individual and professional practice; it requires open debate. The lack of attention to issues of responsibility in the typical computer science curriculum strikes us as a grave professional omission. With this article, we hope to add material to the dialogue on appropriate computing applications and their limits. We also hope to provoke reflections on computing fundamentals and practice at the individual, professional, and disciplinary levels, as well as prodding government institutions, professional societies, and industry to support in-depth research on the issues we raise here. Reflection requires information and discussion. Academic computer science departments rarely support serious consideration of even general issues under the rubric of the social and ethical implications of computing. Unlike any other U.S. computer science department, Information and Computer Science (ICS) at UC Irvine has an active research program in the social implications of computing (Computers, Organizations, Policy and Society—CORPS). Even within CORPS, research that addresses the interactions between the military and computer science is difficult to pursue—not because individuals aren't interested, but because they are not able to find professional or academic support. The authors' interests in these issues arose from personal concerns over the dependence of military systems upon complex technology, and the possible grave outcomes of this fragile relationship. CORPS provided a supportive intellectual environment that allowed us to pursue our interests. In 1987, we developed and taught an undergraduate course designed to inform students about military applications and their limits, and allow dialogue on professional responsibilities. In general, little monetary support is available for research that considers these issues, and it is only through support from the Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation and campus instructional funds that we were able to develop and teach the course. Few researchers or educators can devote time and/or energy to pursue the social and ethical implications of their work and profession, in addition to their mainstream research. Since the discipline of computer science does not consider these reflections serious mainstream research, those who chose to pursue these vital questions have difficulties finding employment and/or advancing through the academic ranks. Growing concern over these issues and interest by computer scientists, as evidenced by the group Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility [38], individuals such as David Parnas [39], and this article, may lead to future research support and academic recognition. For now, as concerned professionals, we offer the following reviews. They pose many more questions than answers. This article exemplifies the interdisciplinary investigations which are required as precursors to serious analysis of computing use in these applications. We hope that our reviews generate discussion and debate. In the first section, we present the course rationale and content, as well as student responses. In the sections following the course description, we consider three applications—smart weapons, battle management, and war game simulations—that are generating research and development funds and that have controversial implications for military uses of computing. We start with smart weapons, that is, the development of weapons that can destroy targets with minimal human intervention. Next we look at battle management systems designed to coordinate and assess the use of resources and people in warfare. Finally, we turn to war gaming as a means for evaluating weapon performance and strategies for war fighting. In each case, we describe the state of technology, its current and potential uses and its implications for the conduct of war. © 1989, ACM.

In this paper, we focus on context-based affect detection using emotion modeling in personal and social communication contexts. Bayesian networks are used for the prediction of the improvisational mood of a particular character and supervised & unsupervised neural networks are employed respectively for the deduction of the emotional indications in the most related interaction contexts and emotional influence towards the current speaking character. Evaluation results of our contextual affect detection using the above approaches are provided. Generally our new developments outperform other previous attempts for contextual affect analysis.

,Continuous Recognition Of Player's Affective Body Expression As Dynamic Quality Of Aesthetic Experience,"The emergence of full-body computer games raises an interesting question: Can body movement be used to measure the aesthetic experience of players? In this paper, we aim to take a first step toward answering this question. Such a question emerges from the fact that various studies have shown the dual role of body movement, i.e., a window on people's emotional and mental states as well as a means to affect people's cognitive and affective processes. In this paper, first, we investigate the possibility of automatically recognizing the emotional expressions conveyed by the player's body movement in a Nintendo sport game. Our results showed that our automatic recognition system achieved recognition rates comparable to human observers' benchmarks. Second, by taking a pragmatist definition of aesthetic experience into account, we argue that the tracked body expressions do not only express what the player may be feeling. Given their modulating role on cognition and affect, these body expressions also let the player actively construct and assign affective meanings to the unfolding of the game. We argue that the player's variety of emotional bodily expressions constitutes the emotional rhythmic dynamic of aesthetic experience and, as such, they provide a measure of its distinctive quality. © 2009-2012 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TCIAIG.2012.2202663,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games,"Savva N., Scarinzi A., Bianchi-Berthouze N.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali

,Cooperation Without Deliberation: A Minimal Behavior-Based Approach To Multi-Robot Teams,"While terminology and some concepts of behavior-based robotics have become widespread, the central ideas are often lost as researchers try to scale behavior to higher levels of complexity. 'Hybrid systems' with model-based strategies that plan in terms of behaviors rather than simple actions have become common for higher-level behavior. We claim that a strict behavior-based approach can scale to higher levels of complexity than many robotics researchers assume, and that the resulting systems are in many cases more efficient and robust than those that rely on 'classical AI' deliberative approaches. Our focus is on systems of cooperative autonomous robots in dynamic environments. We will discuss both claims that deliberation and explicit communication are necessary to cooperation and systems that cooperate only through environmental interaction. In this context we introduce three design principles for complex cooperative behavior - minimalism, statelessness and tolerance - and present a RoboCup soccer system that matches the sophistication of many deliberative soccer systems while exceeding their robustness, through the use of strict behavior-based techniques with no explicit communication.",doi,10.1016/S0004-3702(99)00023-5,Scopus,Artificial Intelligence,Werger B.B.,1999,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Correlates Of Children’s Usage Of Video Games And Computers.,"Fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-grade students responded to a questionnaire concerning their experiences with electronic videogames and computers. Teacher ratings of academic achievement, personality characteristics, and behavior patterns were also obtained for each student. These data were used to examine a number of hypotheses concerning potential harmful or beneficial effects of electronic videogames on school-age children, and to provide preliminary evidence concerning the correlates of computer usage by school-age children. Videogame usage showed significant positive correlations with teacher ratings of impulsivity, significant negative correlations with ratings of academic achievement, and little relationship to rated sociability. Videogame use also proved positively related to other social activities and to microcomputer use.",doi,10.1111/j.1559-1816.1987.tb00293.x,anderson2010,Journal of Applied Social Psychology,"Lin, S., Lepper, M.

,Cortical Topography Of Event-Related Potentials To Winning And Losing In A Video Tennis Game,"The event-related potentials (ERP) in frontal and posterior associative cortex in right and left hemispheres were studied in two different outcomes of a television tennis game. These outcomes were 'win' and 'loss' of the ball, the first serving as a model of positive, the second as a model of negative emotional reactions. The ERPs consisted of 4 waves: P300, N600, P800, N1000. The most characteristic interhemispheric difference for 'win' was an increase of N600 in the left posterior associative cortex, and for 'loss', a decrease of P800 in the right frontal area. Thus, the positive and negative emotional reactions have specific spatio-temporal cortical organizations. The topography of ERP related to positive and negative emotions was disturbed in depressive patients. The patients revealed a larger negativity of the right posterior associative cortex and the left frontal cortex waves both at winning and losing the ball. © 1986.",doi,10.1016/0167-8760(86)90008-5,Scopus,International Journal of Psychophysiology,"Ivanitsky A.M., Kurnitskaya I.V., Sobotka S.",1986,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Creating Adaptive Affective Autonomous Npcs,"The paper reports work to create believable autonomous Non Player Characters in Video games in general and educational role play games in particular. It aims to increase their ability to respond appropriately to the player's actions both cognitively and emotionally by integrating two models: the cognitive appraisal-based FAtiMA architecture, and the drives-based PSI model. We discuss the modelling of adaptive affective autonomous characters based on a biologically-inspired theory of human action regulation taking into account perception, motivation, emotions, memory, learning and planning.

,Creating Autonomous Adaptive Agents In A Real-Time First-Person Shooter Computer Game,"Games are good test-beds to evaluate AI methodologies. In recent years, there has been a vast amount of research dealing with real-time computer games other than the traditional board games or card games. This paper illustrates how we create agents by employing FALCON, a self-organizing neural network that performs reinforcement learning, to play a well-known first-person shooter computer game called Unreal Tournament. Rewards used for learning are either obtained from the game environment or estimated using the temporal difference learning scheme. In this way, the agents are able to acquire proper strategies and discover the effectiveness of different weapons without any guidance or intervention. The experimental results show that our agents learn effectively and appropriately from scratch while playing the game in real-time. Moreover, with the previously learned knowledge retained, our agent is able to adapt to a different opponent in a different map within a relatively short period of time. © 2009-2012 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TCIAIG.2014.2336702,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games,"Wang D., Tan A.-H.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Cross-Modal Distractors Modulate Oscillatory Alpha Power: The Neural Basis Of Impaired Task Performance,"Unexpected novel sounds capture one's attention, even when irrelevant to the task pursued (e.g., playing video game). This often comes at a cost to the task (e.g., slower responding). The neural basis for this behavioral distraction effect is not well understood and is subject of this study. Our approach was motivated by findings from cuing paradigms suggesting a link between modulations in oscillatory activity and voluntary attention shifts. The current study tested whether oscillatory activity is also modulated by a task-irrelevant auditory distractor, reflecting a neural signature of an involuntary shift of attention and accounting for the impaired task performance. We reanalyzed magnetoencephalographic data collected via an auditory-visual distraction paradigm in which a task-relevant visual stimulus was preceded by a task-irrelevant sound on each trial. In 87.5% this was a regular sound (Standard); in 12.5% this was a novel sound (Distractor). We compared nonphase locked oscillatory activity in a time window prior to the visual target as a function of the experimental manipulation (Distractor, Standard). We found low power in the pretarget time window for Distractors compared to Standards in the alpha and beta frequency bands. Importantly, individual alpha power correlated with response speed on a trial-by-trial basis for the Distractor only. Sources were localized to the occipital cortex, and also to the parietal and supratemporal cortices. These findings support our hypothesis that the distractor-related alpha power modulation indexes an involuntary shift of attention which accounts for the impaired task performance. © 2016 Society for Psychophysiological Research.",doi,10.1111/psyp.12733,Scopus,Psychophysiology,"Weise A., Hartmann T., Schröger E., Weisz N., Ruhnau P.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Cruel To Be Kind: Factors Underlying Altruistic Efforts To Worsen Another Person’s Mood,"When aiming to improve another person’s long-term well-being, people may choose to induce a negative emotion in that person in the short term. We labeled this form of agent-target interpersonal emotion regulation altruistic affect worsening and hypothesized that it may happen when three conditions are met: (a) The agent experiences empathic concern for the target of the affect-worsening process, (b) the negative emotion to be induced helps the target achieve a goal (e.g., anger for confrontation or fear for avoidance), and (c) there is no benefit for the agent. This hypothesis was tested by manipulating perspective-taking instructions and the goal to be achieved while participants (N = 140) played a computer-based video game. Participants following other-oriented perspective-taking instructions, compared with those following objective perspective-taking instructions, decided to induce more anger in a supposed fellow participant who was working to achieve a confrontation goal and to induce more fear in a supposed fellow participant who was working to achieve an avoidance goal. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",doi,10.1177/0956797617696312,Scopus,Psychological Science,"López-Pérez B., Howells L., Gummerum M.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Cultural Differences In Morality In The Real And Virtual Worlds: A Comparison Of Chinese And U.s. Youth,"In this research, we examined cultural differences in morality in the real and virtual worlds and the relationship between the two. Approximately 600 Chinese and 600 U.S. youth, average age 12 years old, completed surveys assessing their moral attitudes and behavior in the real world and the acceptability of a diverse set of morally questionable online behaviors. Findings indicated that (a) Chinese youth considered good moral character to be more important than did U.S. youth, whereas U.S. youth considered exceptions to moral behavior that advanced individual goals to be more acceptable than did Chinese youth; (b) Chinese females had the highest level of moral behavior, followed by U.S. females and then Chinese and U.S. males, who did not differ; (c) Chinese youth found morally questionable online behaviors to be more acceptable than did U.S. youth, with the exception of videogame violence, which U.S. youth, especially males, found more acceptable; (d) moral attitudes and behavior in the real world predicted the acceptability of morally questionable online behaviors, whereas the importance of good moral character and the extent of Internet and other technology use did not. The more accepting youth were of exceptions to moral behavior that advanced individual goals, and the less moral their behavior in the real world, the more acceptable they found morally questionable online behaviors. Cultural differences are explained in terms of differences in perceptions of cyberspace as a venue for expressing individual autonomy. © 2008 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",doi,10.1089/cpb.2007.0098,Scopus,Cyberpsychology and Behavior,"Jackson L.A., Zhao Y., Qiu W., Kolenic III A., Fitzgerald H.E., Harold R., Von Eye A.",2008,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Dancing With Physio: A Mobile Game With Physiologically Aware Virtual Humans,"This study presents an evaluation of a mobile game with physiologically aware virtual humans as an approach to modulate the participant's affective and physiological state. We developed a mobile version of a virtual reality scenario where the participants were able to interact with virtual human characters through their psychophysiological activity. Music was played in the background of the scenario and, depending on the experimental condition, the virtual humans were initially either barely dancing or dancing very euphorically. The task of the participants was to encourage the apathetic virtual humans to dance or to calm down the frenetically dancing characters, through the modulation of their own mood and physiological activity. Results from our study show that by using this mobile game with the physiologically aware and affective virtual humans the participants were able to emotionally arouse themselves in the Activation condition and were able to relax themselves in the Relaxation condition, during the same session with only a brief break between conditions. The self-reported affective data was also corroborated by the physiological data (heart rate, respiration and skin conductance) which significantly differed between the Activation and Relaxation conditions. © 2016 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TAFFC.2015.2472013,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing,"Arroyo-Palacios J., Slater M.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Design And Development Of One-Switch Video Games For Children With Severe Motor Disabilities,"Video games are not just played for fun; they have become a handy instrument for the cognitive, emotional, and social development of children. However, several barriers prevent many children with disabilities from playing action-oriented video games, alone or with their peers. In particular, children with severe motor disabilities, who rely on one-switch interaction for accessing electronic devices, find fast-paced games that require rapid decision-making and timely responses, completely unplayable. This article contributes to lowering such barriers by presenting GNomon (Gaming NOMON), a software framework based on the NOMON mode of interaction that allows the creation of action-oriented single-switch video games. The article reports the results of two studies that evaluate the playability and rehabilitation suitability of GNomon-based video games. The playability of GNomon-based games is evaluated by assessing their learnability, effectiveness, errors, satisfaction, memorability, and enjoyability with a group of eight children with severe motor disabilities.The suitability for pediatric rehabilitation is determined by means of a focus group with a team of speech therapists, physiotherapists, and psychologists from a Local Health Agency in Turin, Italy. The results of the playability study are positive: All children had fun playing GNomon-based video games, and seven of eight were able to interact and play autonomously. The results of the rehabilitation-suitability study also entail that GNomon-based games can be exploited in training hand-eye coordination and maintenance of selective attention over time. The article finally offers critical hindsight and reflections and shows possible new future game concepts. © 2017 ACM.",doi,10.1145/3085957,Scopus,ACM Transactions on Accessible Computing,"López S.A., Corno F., De Russis L.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Designing Agents That Recognise And Respond To Players' Emotions,"Giving agents the ability to sense, recognise and appropriately respond to the human emotions is one of the main methods to make the agents more believable. In intelligent tutoring systems, learners' affective states have been incorporated in providing adaptive feedback. In game industry, however, emotions of players have not been paid enough attention. Games normally do not take into account of players' emotions when they play games. Non-player characters do not respond to players' emotional status. We argue that adapting to players' emotions can make the non-player characters more believable and the game more enjoyable. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.",doi,10.1007/978-3-642-29934-6_19,Scopus,"Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies",Chen W.,2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Determinants Of Adoption Of Mobile Games Under Mobile Broadband Wireless Access Environment,"Rapid advancements in technology and changes in cost have made the game industry a profitable area. Recently, Mobile Broadband Wireless Access technology-based (MBWA) games have been introduced into the marketplace. They are superior to current mobile games in terms of transmission speed and price and to older online games that have limited mobility. Since MBWA technologies, such as High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA), Wireless Broadband (WiBro), and Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) have been developed, customers can enjoy games whenever and wherever they like. We decided to analyze the factors that influence potential users' adoption of MBWA games using an extension of TAM. Most previous game-related studies lack a comprehensive approach to both technological and psychological aspects of game adoption and do not reflect a variety of consumer preferences. We therefore extended TAM to include an emotion variable and measured the moderating effects of gender, age, and prior experience on game adoption. Overall, the results revealed that the effect of perceived enjoyment was very important but that usefulness did not influence an individual's attitude. In addition, we also find that age can be key moderator of game acceptance. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

,Determinants Of Left Ventricular Mass In Normotensive Children,"Left ventricular hypertrophy has been shown to be an independent predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Few studies have examined the determinants of left ventricular mass (LVM) in normotensive children. Eighty-four healthy children, blacks and whites, girls and boys, between 6 and 18 years of age, all with positive family histories of essential hypertension, participated in the study. Demographic and anthropometric characteristics, physical activity, and hemodynamic responses at rest and in response to the stress of forehead cold stimulation and a challenging video game were related to M^mode échocardiographie determined LVM indexed by two indices of body habitus. Hierarchical stepwise multiple regression analysis indicated that the significant independent correlates of LVM per body surface area were gender (boys were greater), baseline systolic blood pressure and heart rate, a physical activity index (sweat episodes per week) and peak systolic blood pressure responses to the forehead cold stressor (final model r2 = 0.49). For LVM/height2 × 7 significant independent corre-lates were adiposity index (weight z score — height z score), gender (boys were greater), age, resting systolic pressure, and systemic vascular resistance reactivity to forehead cold stimulation (final model r2 = 0.42). These findings with normotensive children corroborate other findings that have typically involved hypertensive children, indicating that resting heart rate and systolic pressure, gender, and adiposity are early determinants of LVM indices in children. In addition, the current findings indicate that hemodynamic responses to stress also appear to play a role in the early development of LVM. Results are discussed in terms of future research needs in establishing a standard index for body habitus and the need for longitudinal evaluations of the role of such determinants in the development of essential hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy. © 1993 by the American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd.",doi,10.1093/ajh/6.6.505,Scopus,American Journal of Hypertension,"Trieber F.A., McCaffrey F., Pflieger K., Austin Raunikar R., Strong W.B., Davis H.",1993,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Developing A Relational View Of The Organizing Role Of Objects: A Study Of The Innovation Process In Computer Games,"Innovation processes create distinctive challenges for coordination. Objects are seen as supporting coordination in such settings by enabling the emergent action needed to deal with a dynamic and uncertain process. Thus, previous work has highlighted the role of different types of objects in coordinating the collaborative tasks undertaken by expert groups, either by motivating the creation of new knowledge or through the translation of understanding. Through an empirical study of innovation processes in the computer games sector, our paper adds to this previous work by finding that the relations between objects, and not the objects alone, help to orchestrate multiple collaborative tasks towards a final outcome within temporal and resource constraints. The relational view which emerges from this study shows how such a ‘system of objects’ is able to stabilize coordination of the process while preserving the emergence and autonomy of games developer practices needed to achieve innovation. © The Author(s) 2014.",doi,10.1177/0170840614557213,Scopus,Organization Studies,"Scarbrough H., Panourgias N.S., Nandhakumar J.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,"Developing A Triangulation System For Digital Game Events, Observational Video, And Psychophysiological Data To Study Emotional Responses To A Virtual Character","Game researchers are currently lacking comprehensive data analysis tools that triangulate game events, event-related survey data, and psychophysiological data. Such a tool would allow a comprehensive analysis of player engagement in digital games. The development of this tool was motivated by an experimental psychology study that asked whether emotional reactions to congruent and incongruent emotional stimuli within an intrinsically motivated game task are the same as within the traditional experimental picture-viewing paradigm. To address the needs of our study, we used the Source SDK (Valve Corporation) for creating a system that automates event logging, video management psychophysiological data markup.

,Different Slopes For Different Folks: Alpha And Delta Eeg Power Predict Subsequent Video Game Learning Rate And Improvements In Cognitive Control Tasks,"We hypothesized that control processes, as measured using electrophysiological (EEG) variables, influence the rate of learning of complex tasks. Specifically, we measured alpha power, event-related spectral perturbations (ERSPs), and event-related brain potentials during early training of the Space Fortress task, and correlated these measures with subsequent learning rate and performance in transfer tasks. Once initial score was partialled out, the best predictors were frontal alpha power and alpha and delta ERSPs, but not P300. By combining these predictors, we could explain about 50% of the learning rate variance and 10%-20% of the variance in transfer to other tasks using only pretraining EEG measures. Thus, control processes, as indexed by alpha and delta EEG oscillations, can predict learning and skill improvements. The results are of potential use to optimize training regimes. © 2012 Society for Psychophysiological Research.",doi,10.1111/j.1469-8986.2012.01474.x,Scopus,Psychophysiology,"Mathewson K.E., Basak C., Maclin E.L., Low K.A., Boot W.R., Kramer A.F., Fabiani M., Gratton G.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,"Dissonance, Truth And The Political Limits Of Possibility In Mmos","This article argues and synthesizes two fundamental points about the Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMO), with World of Warcraft and Star Wars: The Old Republic serving as the chief examples of the genre. The first is that the use of ethical dilemmas in MMOs is a content-level manifestation of their unique fit to the current moment of late capitalism insofar as such dilemmas stage freedom of choice and action within a structure that restricts autonomy. The second is that the ludonarrative dissonance (via both Lukacs and Hocking) instigated by the merger of the closed, 'epic' form of the video game and the open-ended social aspects introduced in the MMO is a formal aesthetic response to late capitalism. These two threads of argument dovetail into a conclusion on the status of the MMO as a tool of hegemony - a cultural product that manifests and reinforces the norms of the present moment and at the same time has the potential to be repurposed for liberatory ends. © 2015 Intellect Ltd Article.",doi,10.1386/jgvw.7.2.141_1,Scopus,Journal of Gaming and Virtual Worlds,Weihl H.,2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Distributed Power Control For Multiuser Cognitive Radio Networks With Quality Of Service And Interference Temperature Constraints,"One of the most challenging problems in dynamic resource allocation for cognitive radio networks is to adjust transmission power of secondary users (SUs) while quality of service needs of both SUs and primary users (PUs) are guaranteed. Most power control algorithms only consider interference temperature constraint in single user scenario while ignoring the interference from PUs to SUs and minimum signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) requirement of SUs. In this paper, a distributed power control algorithm without user cooperation is proposed for multiuser underlay CNRs. Specifically, we focus on maximizing total throughput of SUs subject to both maximum allowable transmission power constraint and SINR constraint, as well as interference temperature constraint. To reduce the burden of information exchange and computational complexity, an average interference constraint is proposed. Parameter range and convergence analysis are given for feasible solutions. The resource allocation is transformed into a convex optimization problem, which is solved by using Lagrange dual method. In computer simulations, the effectiveness of our proposed scheme is shown by comparing with distributed constrained power control algorithm and Nash bargaining power control game algorithm.

,Does Emotional Arousal Influence Swearing Fluency?,"This study assessed the effect of experimentally manipulated emotional arousal on swearing fluency. We hypothesised that swear word generation would be increased with raised emotional arousal. The emotional arousal of 60 participants was manipulated by having them play a first-person shooter video game or, as a control, a golf video game, in a randomised order. A behavioural measure of swearing fluency based on the Controlled Oral Word Association Test was employed. Successful experimental manipulation was indicated by raised State Hostility Questionnaire scores after playing the shooter game. Swearing fluency was significantly greater after playing the shooter game compared with the golf game. Validity of the swearing fluency task was demonstrated via positive correlations with self-reported swearing fluency and daily swearing frequency. In certain instances swearing may represent a form of emotional expression. This finding will inform debates around the acceptability of using taboo language. © 2017, The Author(s).",doi,10.1007/s10936-016-9473-8,Scopus,Journal of Psycholinguistic Research,"Stephens R., Zile A.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Dual-Circle Self-Localization For Soccer Robots With Omnidirectional Vision,"A self-localization method entitled dual-circle self-localization (DCSL) for mobile robots in a soccer robot game field is proposed in this article. To evaluate the performance of the proposed localization method, an omnidirectional vision device is installed on top of the robot to capture images for recognizing objects in the environment via a hybrid scanning method. Three reliable objects recognized are then chosen as landmarks to calculate the position of the robot in the game field via the proposed DCSL based on relative positions between the robot and landmarks in the omnidirectional images. Since only simple geometric manipulations are required for the DCSL algorithm, localization efficiency can be significantly improved while maintaining a relatively smaller mean error in comparison to Monte Carlo localization techniques as demonstrated in both simulation results and practical experiments in this article. © 2012 The Chinese Institute of Engineers.",doi,10.1080/02533839.2012.701835,Scopus,"Journal of the Chinese Institute of Engineers, Transactions of the Chinese Institute of Engineers,Series A/Chung-kuo Kung Ch'eng Hsuch K'an","Hsu C.-C., Wong C.-C., Teng H.-C., Ho C.-Y.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Dynamic Dazzle Distorts Speed Perception,"Static high contrast ('dazzle') patterns, such as zigzags, have been shown to reduce the perceived speed of an object. It has not escaped our notice that this effect has possible military applications and here we report a series of experiments on humans, designed to establish whether dynamic dazzle patterns can cause distortions of perceived speed sufficient to provide effective defence in the field, and the extent to which these effects are robust to a battery of manipulations. Dynamic stripe patterns moving in the same direction as the target are found to increase the perceived speed of that target, whilst dynamic stripes moving in the opposite direction to the target reduce the perceived speed. We establish the optimum position for such dazzle patches; confirm that reduced contrast and the addition of colour do not affect the performance of the dynamic dazzle, and finally, using the CO2 challenge, show that the effect is robust to stressful conditions. © 2016 Hall et al.

,Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment On Moba Games,"This paper addresses the dynamic difficulty adjustment on MOBA games as a way to improve the players entertainment. Although MOBA is currently one of the most played genres around the world, it is known as a game that offer less autonomy, more challenges and consequently more frustration. Due to these characteristics, the use of a mechanism that performs the difficulty balance dynamically seems to be an interesting alternative to minimize and/or avoid that players experience such frustrations. In this sense, this paper presents a dynamic difficulty adjustment mechanism for MOBA games. The main idea is to create a computer controlled opponent that adapts dynamically to the player performance, trying to offer to the player a better game experience. This is done by evaluating the performance of the player using a metric based on some game features and switching the difficulty of the opponent's artificial intelligence behavior accordingly. Quantitative and qualitative experiments were performed and the results showed that the system is capable of adapting dynamically to the opponent's skills. In spite of that, the qualitative experiments with users showed that the player's expertise has a greater influence on the perception of the difficulty level and dynamic adaptation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",doi,10.1016/j.entcom.2016.10.002,Scopus,Entertainment Computing,"Silva M.P., Silva V.D.N., Chaimowicz L.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali

,Effect Of Divergent Self-Monitoring Strategies On Motor Performance And Emotion As A Function Of Alternating Task Complexity,"The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of implementing different self-monitoring (SM) strategies as a function of varying task complexity on a computer game, 'Shufflepuck'. Self-monitoring theory suggests that positive self-monitoring (PSM) results in better performance for difficult tasks, whereas negative self-monitoring (NSM) is preferable for easy tasks. When SM was tested under easy and complex task conditions, it was found that performance effectiveness was a function of matching appropriate task difficulty with the SM strategy. Unpaired t-tests compared the first set of 100 trials (pre-task) with the second set of 100 trials (post-task) on a computer skills game requiring hand-eye coordination. The results showed that subjects who changed from the difficult task/PSM condition to the easy task/PSM condition (different task, same SM strategy) performed significantly poorer (P < 0.001) than subjects who changed from the difficult task/PSM condition to the easy task/NSM condition (different task, different SM strategy). A second unpaired t-test comparing the two sets of difference performance scores indicated that performance was significantly superior for subjects using the PSM than the NSM strategy while performing the difficult task (P < 0.05). That is, changing from the easy task/NSM condition to the difficult task/NSM condition produced poorer performance than changing from the easy task/NSM to the difficult task/PSM condition. In terms of subjects' emotions, the use of NSM and PSM when performing easy and difficult tasks, respectively, resulted in markedly less negative affect (P < 0.01), but did not influence positive affect, on pre- and post-task comparisons. Finally, correlations between affect and performance, based on pre- and post-performance and affect scores, were moderate to high. Implications of the present results for slumps in sport performance are offered. © 1996 E. & F.N.

,"Effect Of Game Format On Heart Rate, Activity Profile, And Player Involvement In Elite And Recreational Youth Players","The purpose of this study was to evaluate activity profile, aerobic load, and player involvement in two game formats of recreational and elite youth football for two age groups. A total of 152 youth players participated, with 45 U10 players playing 5v5 and 8v8 games, and 41 U13 players playing 8v8 and 11v11 (20min) games. Activity profile, heart rate (HR), and technical actions were measured during all games using 10Hz GPS, video filming, and HR monitors. For U10, no difference was found in total distance covered (1754±237 vs 1771±314m, P=0.650, d=0.06), whereas mean HR (174±10 vs 168±12bpm, P=0.001, d=0.59) and number of technical actions (65.1±24.0 vs 36.9±20.4, P<0.001, d=1.27) were higher in 5v5 than in 8v8. For U13, lower total distance covered (1821±325 vs 2038±328m, P<0.001, d=0.66) and higher number of technical actions (36.2±14.9 vs 26.9±14.1, P<0.001, d=0.64) were observed in 8v8 than in 11v11, with no difference in mean HR (170±10 vs 171±10bpm, P=0.679, d=0.10). In conclusion, HR is high in youth football matches irrespective of the level of play and the game format. Playing with fewer players on smaller pitches results in minor changes to the physical loading but elevates the technical involvement of youth players both at elite level and recreational level. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

,Effectiveness And Feasibility Of Virtual Reality And Gaming System Use At Home By Older Adults For Enabling Physical Activity To Improve Health-Related Domains: A Systematic Review,"Background: use of virtual reality and commercial gaming systems (VR/gaming) at home by older adults is receiving attention as a means of enabling physical activity. Objective: to summarise evidence for the effectiveness and feasibility of VR/gaming system utilisation by older adults at home for enabling physical activity to improve impairments, activity limitations or participation. Methods: A systematic review searching 12 electronic databases from 1 January 2000-10 July 2012 using key search terms. Two independent reviewers screened yield articles using pre-determined selection criteria, extracted data using customised forms and applied the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool and the Downs and Black Checklist to rate study quality. Results: Fourteen studies investigating the effects of VR/gaming system use by healthy older adults and people with neurological conditions on activity limitations, body functions and physical impairments and cognitive and emotional well-being met the selection criteria. Study quality ratings were low and, therefore, evidence was not strong enough to conclude that interventions were effective. Feasibility was inconsistently reported in studies. Where feasibility was discussed, strong retention (≥70%) and adherence (≥64%) was reported. Initial assistance to use the technologies, and the need for monitoring exertion, aggravation of musculoskeletal symptoms and falls risk were reported. Conclusions: Existing evidence to support the feasibility and effectiveness VR/gaming systems use by older adults at home to enable physical activity to address impairments, activity limitations and participation is weak with a high risk of bias. The findings of this review may inform future, more rigorous research. © The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the British Geriatrics Society.

,Effects Of An Exercise Intervention Using Dance Dance Revolution On Endothelial Function And Other Risk Factors In Overweight Children,"Objective. To determine whether an exercise intervention using an active video game (Dance Dance Revolution™ [DDR]) is effective in improving endothelial dysfunction (EDF) and other risk factors in overweight children. Design. Thirty-five children (Body mass index ≥ 85th percentile, mean age 10.21±1.67 years, 17 females) with EDF were assessed for flow-mediated dilation (FMD), lipids, insulin, glucose, NO2+NO3, asymmetric dimethylarginine, symmetric dimethylarginine, l-arginine, height, weight, aerobic fitness, and blood pressure. In a subsample, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, and adiponectin were also assessed. Subjects were randomly assigned to 12-weeks of aerobic exercise (EX) using DDR or to a non-exercising delayed-treatment control group (DTC). Results. EX had significant improvements in FMD ( 5.56±5.04% compared with 0.263±4.54%, p=0.008), exercise time on the graded exercise test (53.59±91.54 compared with -12.83±68.10 seconds, p=0.025), mean arterial pressure (MAP) (-5.62±7.03 compared with-1.44±2.16 mmHg, p=0.05), weight (0.91±1.53 compared with 2.43±1.80 kg, p=0.017) and peak VO2 (2.38±3.91 compared with-1.23±3.18 mg/kg/min, p=0.005) compared with the DTC. Thirteen EX subjects achieved normal EDF while ten did not. These groups differed at baseline with regard to total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Conclusion. Twelve weeks of DDR-use improved FMD, aerobic fitness, and MAP in overweight children. Improvements occurred without changes in inflammatory markers or nitric oxide production. The results document the need to explore relationships between obesity, endothelial function, inflammation, lipids, exercise intensity, and gender in a larger sample of overweight children. © 2009 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved.",doi,10.3109/17477160902846187,Scopus,International Journal of Pediatric Obesity,"Murphy E.C.-S., Carson L., Neal W., Baylis C., Donley D., Yeater R.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Effects Of Automation And Task Load On Task Switching During Human Supervision Of Multiple Semi-Autonomous Robots In A Dynamic Environment,"The present study assessed the impact of task load and level of automation (LOA) on task switching in participants supervising a team of four or eight semi-autonomous robots in a simulated 'capture the flag' game. Participants were faster to perform the same task than when they chose to switch between different task actions. They also took longer to switch between different tasks when supervising the robots at a high compared to a low LOA. Task load, as manipulated by the number of robots to be supervised, did not influence switch costs. The results suggest that the design of future unmanned vehicle (UV) systems should take into account not simply how many UVs an operator can supervise, but also the impact of LOA and task operations on task switching during supervision of multiple UVs. The findings of this study are relevant for the ergonomics practice of UV systems. This research extends the cognitive theory of task switching to inform the design of UV systems and results show that switching between UVs is an important factor to consider.",doi,10.1080/00140139.2010.489969,Scopus,Ergonomics,"Squire P.N., Parasuraman R.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Effects Of Different Post-Match Recovery Interventions On Subsequent Athlete Hormonal State And Game Performance,"We tested the effects of different post-match recovery interventions on the subsequent hormonal responses to a physical stress-test and game performance in professional rugby union players. On four occasions, participants (n = 12) completed a video session (1. h each) with accompanying coach feedback the day after a rugby union match. The interventions showed either video footage of player mistakes with negative coach feedback (NCF1) or player successes with positive feedback (PCF1). Both approaches were repeated (NCF2 and PCF2). In the following week, participants were assessed for their free testosterone (T) and cortisol (C) responses to a physical stress-test, pre-game T and game-ranked performance. The PFC1 and PCF2 approaches were both associated with significantly (p< 0.01) greater free T (36% to 42%) responses to the stress-test when compared to NCF1 and NCF2 (16% to - 3%), respectively. The PCF interventions were also associated with higher (28% to 51%) pre-game T concentrations and superior game-ranked performances than the NCF approaches (p< 0.01). In conclusion, the post-game presentation of specific video footage combined with different coach feedbacks appeared to influence the free hormonal state of rugby players and game performance several days later. Therefore, within the sporting context, future behaviour and performance might be modified through the use of simple psychological strategies. These data are applicable to generalised human stress responses and their modifiability by prior exposure to a stressor. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",doi,10.1016/j.physbeh.2012.03.015,Scopus,Physiology and Behavior,"Crewther B.T., Cook C.J.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Effects Of Interactive Video Game Cycling On Overweight And Obese Adolescent Health,"The purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy of interactive video game stationary cycling (GameBike) in comparison with stationary cycling to music on adherence, energy expenditure measures, submaximal aerobic fitness, body composition, and cardiovascular disease risk markers in overweight and obese adolescents, using a randomized controlled trial design. Thirty overweight (with at least 1 metabolic complication) or obese adolescents aged 12-17 years were stratified by gender and randomized to video game or music condition, with 4 participants (2 per group) failing to complete the twice weekly 60 min sessions of the 10-week trial. The music group had a higher rate of attendance compared with the video game group (92% vs. 86%, p < 0.05). Time spent in minutes per session at vigorous intensity (80%-100% of predicted peak heart rate) (24.9 ± 20 min vs. 13.7 ± 12.8 min, p < 0.05) and average distance (km) pedaled per session (12.5 ± 2.8 km vs. 10.2 ± 2.2 km, p < 0.05) also favoured the music group. However, both interventions produced significant improvements in submaximal indicators of aerobic fitness as measured by a graded cycle ergometer protocol. Also, when collapsed, the exercise modalities reduced body fat percentage and total cholesterol. The present study indicates that cycling to music was just as effective as stationary cycling while playing video games at improving fitness, body composition, and cholesterol profiles in overweight and obese teens, and resulted in increased attendance, vigorous intensity of physical activity, and distance pedaled. Therefore, our data support the superiority of cycling to music and indicate investing in the more expensive GameBike may not be worth the cost.",doi,10.1139/H10-078,Scopus,"Applied Physiology, Nutrition and Metabolism","Adamo K.B., Rutherford J.A., Goldfield G.S.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Effects Of Media Violence On Health-Related Outcomes Among Young Men,"Objective: To test the effects of media violence exposure on blood pressure, negative affect, hostile social information processing, uncooperative behavior, and attitudes toward health risk behaviors among young men varying in lifetime violence exposure within the home and community. Design: Experimental laboratory study. Setting: University campus situated within an urban environment. Participants: One hundred male undergraduates aged 18 to 21 years. Intervention: Men who had previously reported differing amounts of lifetime home and community violence were randomly assigned to play The Simpsons: Hit and Run (low-violence condition) or Grand Theft Auto III (high-violence condition). Main Outcome Measures: Systolic and diastolic blood pressure; negative affect; hostile social information processing; uncooperative behavior; and permissive attitudes toward violence, alcohol use, marijuana use, and sexual activity without condom use. Results: Men randomly assigned to play Grand Theft Auto III exhibited greater increases in diastolic blood pressure from a baseline rest period to game play, greater negative affect, more permissive attitudes toward using alcohol and marijuana, and more uncooperative behavior in comparison with men randomly assigned to play The Simpsons. Only among participants with greater exposure to home and community violence, play of Grand Theft Auto III led to elevated systolic blood pressure in comparison with play of The Simpsons (mean, 13 vs 5 mm Hg). Conclusions: Media violence exposure may play a role in the development of negative attitudes and behaviors related to health. Although youth growing up in violent homes and communities may become more physiologically aroused by media violence exposure, all youth appear to be at risk for potentially negative outcomes. ©2006 American Medical Association.

,"Effects Of Race, Sex, And Socioeconomic Status Upon Cardiovascular Stress Responsivity And Recovery In Youth","Cardiovascular (CV) responsivity to and recovery from acute laboratory stressors, as derived from aggregate scores of CV functioning during and after postural change, video game challenge, social competence interview, and parent-child conflict discussion, were evaluated in 272 youths [mean age 13.5 ± 2.6 years; 162 Blacks (77 males, 85 females), 110 Whites (60 males, 50 females)], all with a positive family history of essential hypertension. Blacks demonstrated greater systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP) and lower heart rate responsivity compared to Whites (all P values < 0.05). A race by neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) interaction for SBP responsivity was also observed where low SES Whites and high SES Blacks had the greatest responsivity compared to their same race cohorts. Additionally, upper SES Whites had the lowest total peripheral resistance responsivity. For recovery, Blacks and males exhibited higher SBP during recovery compared to Whites and females, respectively. These findings extend previous studies and provide further support for the hypothesis that recovery from stress is a potentially informative component of the contribution of stress responsivity to cardiovascular disease.",doi,10.1016/S0167-8760(98)00044-0,Scopus,International Journal of Psychophysiology,"Jackson R.W., Treiber F.A., Turner J.R., Davis H., Strong W.B.",1999,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,"Effects Of Short-Term Active Video Game Play On Community Adults: Under International Classification Of Functioning, Disability And Health Consideration","Background The effects of active video game play on healthy individuals remain uncertain. A person's functional health status constitutes a dynamic interaction between components identified in the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF). The aim of this study was to investigate the short-term effects of active video game play on community adults using the ICF. Methods Sixty community adults with an average age of 59.3 years and without physical disabilities were recruited. Over 2 weeks, each adult participated in six sessions of active video game play lasting 20 minutes each. Participants were assessed before and after the intervention. Variables were collected using sources related to the ICF components, including the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory, Biodex Stability System, chairrising time, Frenchay Activity Index, Rivermead Mobility Index, Chronic Pain Grade Questionnaire, Work Ability Index, and World Health Organization Quality of Life-Brief Version. Results Compared to baseline data, significantly reduced risk of a fall measured by Biodex Stability System and improvements in disability scores measured by the Chronic Pain Grade Questionnaire were noted. There was no significant change in the other variables measured.

,Elite Futsal Refereeing: Activity Profile And Physiological Demands,"Rebelo, AN, Ascensao, AA, Magalhaes, JF, Bischoff, R, Bendiksen, M, and Krustrup, P. Elite futsal refereeing: activity profile and physiological demands. J Strength Cond Res 25(4): 980-987, 2011-The purpose of this study was to determine the physiological demands and to establish the relationship between activity profile and endurance capacity of futsal referees. Eighteen elite futsal referees (33.0 6 5.1 years, 173 6 5 cm, and 73.2 6 8.4 kg) were studied. Video filming (n = 18) and heart rate (HR) recordings were performed throughout games. Blood lactate (n = 14) was determined at rest and after the game. Endurance capacity was determined with the Yo-Yo IE2. The number of activity changes was as high as 1,395 6 218 (6SD). Total distance covered, high-intensity running (HIR), sprinting (SPR), and sideways running were 5.89 6 0.56, 0.96 6 0.29, 0.09 6 0.07, and 0.91 6 0.46 km, respectively. The number of HIR and SPR bouts was 129 6 41 and 9 6 8, respectively, with a mean duration of ∼1.4 seconds. Blood lactate content was 1.0 6 0.3 and 1.5 6 0.5 mM before and after the game. The amount of HIR performed during the match correlated significantly (r = 0.77; p < 0.05) with the Yo-Yo IE2 performance.

,Emotion Regulation And Mania Risk: Differential Responses To Implicit And Explicit Cues To Regulate,"Background and objectives People prone to mania use emotion regulation (ER) strategies well when explicitly coached to do so in laboratory settings, but they find these strategies ineffective in daily life. We hypothesized that, compared with control participants, mania-prone people would show ER deficits when they received implicit, but not explicit, cues to use ER. Methods Undergraduates (N = 66) completed the Hypomanic Personality Scale (HPS) and were randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions: automatic ER (scrambled sentence primes), deliberate ER (verbal instructions), or control (no priming or instructions to use ER). Then, participants played a videogame designed to evoke anger. Emotion responses were measured with a multi-modal assessment of self-reported affect, psychophysiology, and facial expressions. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) was used to index ER. Results The videogame effectively elicited subjective anger, angry facial expressions, and heart rate increases when keys malfunctioned. As hypothesized, persons who were more mania prone showed greater RSA increases in the deliberate ER condition than in the automatic or control conditions. Limitations One potential limitation is the use of an analog sample. Conclusions Findings suggest that those at risk for mania require more explicit instruction to engage ER effectively. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

,Emotional Expressivity As A Signal Of Cooperation,"Previous research has suggested that the spontaneous display of positive emotion may be a reliable signal of cooperative tendency in humans. Consistent with this proposition, several studies have found that self-reported cooperators indeed display higher levels of positive emotions than non-cooperators. In this study, we defined cooperators and non-cooperators in terms of their behavior as the proposer in an ultimatum game, and video-taped their facial expressions as they faced unfair offers as a responder. A detailed analysis of the facial expressions displayed by participants revealed that cooperators displayed greater amounts of emotional expressions, not limited to positive emotional expression, when responding to unfair offers in the ultimatum game. These results suggest that cooperators may be more emotionally expressive than non-cooperators. We speculate that emotional expressivity can be a more reliable signal of cooperativeness than the display of positive emotion alone. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

,Emotional Journeys In Game Design Teams,"There is little research into the emotional dimension of creative industry personnel, such as computer game designers, and how emotions relate to their creative practices and work-related events. Such socioemotional work is the focus of this chapter. There is a practice-centered relevance to this topic too - it is reported that there exists a poor quality of life in many global game studios. Given our deficient knowledge of emotions in computer game development, and the practical resonance of this topic, our key research question is: What emotions, creative practices and work-related events characterize emotional journeys in computer game design teams, and how do these characteristics inter-relate? To explore and answer this research question, we draw on an in-depth field study of a computer games studio in Singapore. The chapter offers a theory of emotion-mediated improvisation as a coping model for the tumultuous emotional journeys that game developers endure. © 2011, IGI Global.",doi,10.4018/978-1-60960-567-4.ch014,Scopus,"Business, Technological, and Social Dimensions of Computer Games: Multidisciplinary Developments","Stacey P., Nandhakumar J.",2011,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Emotional Responses To Victory And Defeat As A Function Of Opponent,"The experiment with 33 participants showed that the social relationship between players (playing a first-person shooter game against a friend or a stranger, and in single-player mode) influences phasic emotion-related psychophysiological responses to digital game events representing victory and defeat. Irrespective of opponent type, a defeat elicited increasing positive affect and decreasing negative affect (supporting earlier results), but it was most arousing when the opponent was a friend. Surprisingly, victory - in addition to positive emotion when playing against either human opponent - also elicited a negative response when the opponent was a friend. Responses to defeat in a single-player game were similar, but to a victory almost neutral. These results show that the social context affects not only the general experience, but also individual emotional responses, which has implications for adaptive game systems, experience research, and game design alike. © 2010-2012 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/T-AFFC.2013.12,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing,"Kivikangas J.M., Ravaja N.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Energy Expenditure And Exercise Intensity Of Interactive Video Gaming In Individuals Poststroke,"Background. Off-the-shelf activity-promoting video games (AVGs) are proposed as a tool for promoting regular physical activity among individuals poststroke. Objective. To characterize the energy expenditure (EE), exercise intensity, and energy metabolism of individuals poststroke, while playing AVGs in different positions, from different consoles, and to compare the performance with comfortable walking and with able-bodied individuals. Methods. Eleven poststroke and 8 able-bodied participants played in standing Wii-Boxing Xbox-Boxing, Wii-Run and Penguin, and also Wii-Boxing in sitting. EE (expressed as metabolic equivalents [METs]); exercise intensity (expressed as %predicted maximal heart rate [HR]), rate of perceived exertion (RPE), and respiratory exchange ratio (RER) were used to characterize the games. Results. Participants' poststroke EE ranged from 1.81 ± 0.74 to 3.46 ± 1.3 METs and was lower compared with able-bodied participants for Xbox-Boxing (P =.001), Wii-Boxing in standing (P =.01), Run (P <.001), and Penguin (P =.001). Participants' poststroke exercise intensity ranged from 49.8 ± 9.3 to 64.7 ± 9.3 %predicted maximal HR and was lower compared with able-bodied participants for Xbox-Boxing (P =.007) and Run (P =.005). For participants poststroke, EE of walking at a comfortable did not differ from boxing games in standing or Run. For able-bodied participants only, the EE for Xbox-Boxing was higher than Wii-Boxing (6.5 ± 2.6 vs 4.4 ± 1.1, P =.02). EE was higher in standing versus sitting for poststroke (P =.04) and able-bodied (P =.03) participants. There were no significant group differences for RPEs. RER of playing in sitting approached anaerobic metabolism. Conclusions. Playing upper extremity (ie, Boxing) or mobility (ie, Run) AVGs in standing resulted in moderate EE and intensity for participants poststroke. EE was lower for poststroke than for able-bodied participants. © 2013 The Author(s).",doi,10.1177/1545968313497100,Scopus,Neurorehabilitation and Neural Repair,"Kafri M., Myslinski M.J., Gade V.K., Deutsch J.E.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Energy Expenditure And Intensity In Healthy Young Adults During Exergaming,"Objectives: To examine and compare the energy expenditure (EE) and intensity of Xbox 360 Kinect exergames in healthy young adults. Methods: Seventeen young adults (22.0±2.9 years; 7 men) were enrolled and asked to complete 6 exergames using Xbox 360 Kinect. Oxygen consumption (VO2) and heart rate (HR) were measured throughout each exergame, and metabolic equivalents (METs) and EE were calculated from VO2. Results: Boxing (6.8±1.9 METs) and soccer (6.2±1.7 METs) provided vigorous intensity of physical activity, which was significantly greater than track and field, ping-pong, and bowling (5.0±1.5, 4.0±1.6, and 2.6±0.8 METs, respectively; all p <.01). Beach volleyball (5.7±1.8 METs) was greater than ping-pong and bowling (both p <.01). EE exhibited a similar pattern. These results remained after adjusting for participants' previous exergaming experience and resting HR. Conclusions: Kinect Sports from Xbox 360 Kinect is capable of providing a moderate-tovigorous level of physical activity in young healthy adults. These exergames may be used as an alternative mode of exercise to promote physical activity participation in this population. Future research that evaluates the feasibility of using exergames as an alternative mode of exercise in other populations is warranted.",doi,10.5993/AJHB.39.4.12,Scopus,American Journal of Health Behavior,"Wu P.-T., Wu W.-L., Chu I.-H.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Enhancing The Therapy Experience Using Principles Of Video Game Design,"Purpose: This article considers the potential benefits that applying design principles from contemporary video games may have on enhancing therapy experiences. Method: Six principles of video game design are presented, and their relevance for enriching clinical experiences is discussed. Results: The motivational and learning benefits of each design principle have been discussed in the education literature as having positive impacts on student motivation and learning and are related here to aspects of clinical practice. The essential experience principle suggests connecting all aspects of the experience around a central emotion or cognitive connection. The discovery principle promotes indirect learning in focused environments. The risktaking principle addresses the uncertainties clients face when attempting newly learned skills in novel situations. The generalization principle encourages multiple opportunities for skill transfer. The reward system principle directly relates to the scaffolding of frequent and varied feedback in treatment. Last, the identity principle can assist clients in using their newly learned communication skills to redefine self-perceptions. Conclusion: These principles highlight areas for research and interventions that may be used to reinforce or advance current practice. © 2016 American Speech-Language-Hearing Association.",doi,10.1044/2015_AJSLP-14-0059,Scopus,American Journal of Speech-Language Pathology,"Folkins J.W., Brackenbury T., Krause M., Haviland A.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,"Estradiol, Progesterone, And Cardiovascular Response To Stress","The present study examined the relationship between endogenous estradiol and progesterone levels and cardiovascular activity at rest and during stress in healthy young women. Subjects were tested in both the follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle. Results indicated that, during the luteal phase, higher levels of estradiol were associated with lower levels of cardiac output responses to the combined video game and speech tasks, and lower levels of heart rate and systolic blood pressure responses to the cold pressor; estradiol levels were also associated positively wit PEP responses to the cold pressor but only under high levels of progesterone. Additionally, during the luteal phase, higher levels of progesterone were associated with higher TPR and lower stroke volume responses to the cold pressor. In contrast, during the follicular phase, higher levels of progesterone were associated with lower vascular resistance responses to the cold pressor. Consistent with data from studies using exogenous estrogens, these results suggest that estradiol may contribute to a lowering of cardiovascular responses to stress.",doi,10.1016/0306-4530(95)00053-4,Scopus,Psychoneuroendocrinology,"Sita A., Miller S.B.",1996,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Eternal Triangulation: Case Studies In The Evaluation Of Educational Software By Classroom-Based Teacher Groups,"The paper begins by reviewing some problematic issues in the evaluation of educational software. Special attention is drawn to the formal and practical difficulties associated with ""classical"" input/output evaluation paradigms. These problems are especially acute in the case of the vast range of computer-based materials which do not readily fall into the conventional CAL mould. Such software includes adventure games, word processors, spreadsheets etc. We examine the evaluation process in terms of its clientele. We suggest that administrators, working at the strategic level of decision making, and teachers working at the tactical level, have needs for rather different types of information, which cannot necessarily be met through the application of any single approach to evaluation. We identify our particular clientele as being classroom teachers, and we discuss the implications of this targeting for the design of evaluation procedures. We discuss the central role of the practitioners themselves in generating an appropriate richness and variety of information. We describe the development of ""IN-CITES"": a classroom-based case study approach to software evaluation intended for application by autonomous self-programming groups of teachers. This approach is based on the so-called ""triangulation"" methodology, and employs both methodological triangulation (using a range of techniques) and observational triangulation (using a variety of observational perspectives). Our approach is designed to provide teachers with a framework for software evaluation, rather than a rigidly denned set of procedures. We acknowledge that many teachers have specialised knowledge and skills which they will wish to bring to bear on their own problems, and we have worked to provide the outlines of a disciplined approach to the evaluation process analogous to the case history method in routine medical practice. © 1988.",doi,10.1016/0360-1315(88)90070-X,Scopus,Computers and Education,"Smith D., Keep R.",1988,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Evaluating The Efficacy Of Simulators And Multimedia For Refreshing Acls Skills In India,"Objective: Data on the efficacy of the simulation and multimedia teaching modalities is limited, particularly in developing nations. This study evaluates the effectiveness of simulator and multimedia educational tools in India. Methods: Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) certified paramedic students in India were randomized to either Simulation, Multimedia, or Reading for a 3-h ACLS refresher course. Simulation students received a lecture and 10 simulator cases. The Multimedia group viewed the American Heart Association (AHA) ACLS video and played a computer game. The Reading group independently read with an instructor present. Students were tested prior to (pre-test), immediately after (post-test), and 3 weeks after (short-term retention test), their intervention. During each testing stage subjects completed a cognitive, multiple-choice test and two cardiac arrest scenarios. Changes in exam performance were analyzed for significance. A survey was conducted asking students' perceptions of their assigned modality. Results: One hundred and seventeen students were randomized to Simulation (n = 39), Multimedia (n = 38), and Reading (n = 40). Simulation demonstrated greater improvement managing cardiac arrest scenarios compared to both Multimedia and Reading on the post-test (9% versus 5% and 2%, respectively, p < 0.05) and Reading on the short-term retention test (6% versus -1%, p < 0.05). Multimedia showed significant improvement on cognitive, short-term retention testing compared to Simulation and Reading (5% versus 0% and 0%, respectively, p < 0.05). On the survey, 95% of Simulation and 84% of Multimedia indicated they enjoyed their modality. Conclusion: Simulation and multimedia educational tools were effective and may provide significant additive benefit compared to reading alone.

,Evaluation Of A Manual Wheelchair Interface To Computer Games,"The sedentary lifestyle of many people with spinal cord injury (SCI) has lead to cardiovascular diseases being a major health concern. A suitable exercise program may help improve the SCI individual's cardiovascular fitness level. GAMEWheels is an in terface between a custom wheelchair roller system and a computer that enables an individual to control computer video games by driving his or her wheelchair. The purpose of Phase 1 was to evaluate the design of the GAMEwhccls system and to determine the type of computer video game that is likely to motivate wheelchair users to exercise. Phase 2 included physiologic testing of wheelchair users and the GAMEWheels system to investigate whether the system elicits an exercise training re sponse. Thirty-five subjects were recruited to evaluate the GAMEWheels by playing three commercial computer games (Phase 1) and to identify the computer game that they would prefer to use when exercising. The feedback from Phase 1 was used with test subjects to verify that the GAMEWheels system elicits an exercise training effect (Phase 2). Phase 2 included 10 subjects using the GAMEWheels system to play Need for Speed II. During game play, physiologic data were collected and the subjects' oxy gen consumption and heart rate were analyzed. Analysis showed that the GAMEWheels system induced nine subjects to reach their training zone, defined as 50% and 60% of their maximum oxygen consumption and heart rate, respectively. This study demon strates that the GAMEWheels system elicits an exercise training response. © 2000, Sage Publications.

,Event-Related Potential Correlates Of Interference Effects On Recognition Memory,"The question of interference (how new learning affects previously acquired knowledge and vice versa) is a central theoretical issue in episodic memory research, but very few human neuroimaging studies have addressed this question. Here, we used event-related potentials (ERPs) to test the predictions of the complementary learning systems (CLS) model regarding how list strength manipulations (strengthening some, but not all, items on a study list) affect recognition memory. Our analysis focused on the FN400 old-new effect, a hypothesized ERP correlate of familiarity-based recognition, and the parietal old-new effect, a hypothesized ERP correlate of recollection-based recognition. As is predicted by the CLS model, increasing list strength selectively reduced the ERP correlate of recollection-based discrimination, leaving the ERP correlate of familiarity-based discrimination intact. In a second experiment, we obtained converging evidence for the CLS model's predictions, using a remember/know test: Increasing list strength reduced recollection-based discrimination but did not reduce familiarity-based discrimination.

,"Examining Desensitization Using Facial Electromyography:violent Videogames, Gender, And Affective Responding","The results of research investigating the effects of violent videogames have been inconsistent. Some evidence suggests that exposure to violent videogames decreases physiological arousal and results in desensitization to subsequent exposure to violent stimuli. Other research does not support these findings. This study examined physiological and affective desensitization to violent videogame play. Participants played a violent or non-violent videogame and then viewed aggressive, pleasant, and neutral images. Participants' negative affect in response to the images was assessed by examining activity in the brow muscle region (i.e., corrugator supercilii), heart rate (HR), self-reported affect, and self-reported arousal. Based on previous research regarding the General Aggression Model (GAM), we expected that participants who played the violent videogame would demonstrate desensitization as evidenced by less reactivity in the corrugator supercilii region and less HR reactivity in response to violent images than participants who played the nonviolent videogame. We also expected that participants who played the violent videogame would rate the aggressive images as less aversive than those who played the nonviolent game. Contrary to our expectations, the findings were not consistent with the hypotheses based on the GAM. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

,Exercise Videogames For Physical Activity And Fitness: Design And Rationale Of The Wii Heart Fitness Trial,"Introduction: Despite numerous health benefits, less than half of American adults engage in regular physical activity. Exercise videogames (EVG) may be a practical and attractive alternative to traditional forms of exercise. However there is insufficient research to determine whether EVG play alone is sufficient to produce prolonged engagement in physical activity or improvements in cardiovascular fitness and overall health risk. The goal of the present study is to test the efficacy of exercise videogames to increase time spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and to improve cardiovascular risk indices among adults. Methods: Wii Heart Fitness is a rigorous 3-arm randomized controlled trial with adults comparing three 12-week programs: (1) supervised EVGs, (2) supervised standard exercise, and (3) a control condition. Heart rate is monitored continuously throughout all exercise sessions. Assessments are conducted at baseline, end of intervention (week 12), 6 and 9. months. The primary outcome is time spent in MVPA physical activity. Secondary outcomes include changes in cardiovascular fitness, body composition, blood lipid profiles and maintenance of physical activity through six months post-treatment. Changes in cognitive and affective constructs derived from Self Determination and Social Cognitive Theories will be examined to explain the differential outcomes between the two active treatment conditions. Conclusion: The Wii Heart Fitness study is designed to test whether regular participation in EVGs can be an adequate source of physical activity for adults. This study will produce new data on the effect of EVGs on cardiovascular fitness indices and prolonged engagement with physical activity. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",doi,10.1016/j.cct.2015.04.007,Scopus,Contemporary Clinical Trials,"Bock B.C., Thind H., Dunsiger S.I., Serber E.R., Ciccolo J.T., Cobb V., Palmer K., Abernathy S., Marcus B.H.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Exergames For Older Adults With Subthreshold Depression: Does Higher Playfulness Lead To Better Improvement In Depression?,"Objective: The use of exergames is increasingly prevalent in the healthcare promotion among older adults. The current study aimed to examine whether the playfulness may influence the antidepressant effect of exergames on older adults. Method: Two experimental conditions, high playfulness (Wii™ Sport games) and low playfulness (Wii Fit™ training), were implemented in a 6-week randomized controlled study. A manipulation check was conducted first to confirm the significant difference in playfulness between the two conditions. A total of 49 community-dwelling older adults diagnosed with subthreshold depression have finished the study. Their depression, positive emotions, and self-efficacy were measured at both pre- and post-test. A multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) was then conducted between two conditions, with age and gender as the covariates. Results: Findings suggest that older adults in both two exergame conditions have improvements in subthreshold depression [t(48) = 9.48, P < 0.001], positive emotions [t(48) = -12.04, P < 0.001], and self-efficacy [t(48) = -9.78, P < 0.001]. Significant effect of playfulness in exergames was found on positive emotions among older adults [F(3, 47) = 20.82, P < 0.001], although not on subthreshold depression and self-efficacy. Conclusion: Results gained from the study will assist in the future implementation and development of exergames that aim to improve mental health among older adults. © Copyright 2016, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016.",doi,10.1089/g4h.2015.0100,Scopus,Games for Health Journal,"Li J., Theng Y.-L., Foo S.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Explicit And Implicit Anti-Fat Attitudes In Children And Their Relationships With Their Body Images,"Objective: This study aimed to explore the prevalence of negative attitudes toward overweight peers among children using different explicit and implicit measures, and to analyze their relationships with some aspects of their body image. Method: A total of 120 children aged 6-11 years were interviewed using a computer program that simulated a game containing several tasks. Specifically, we have applied multiple measures of explicit attitudes toward average-weight/overweight peers, several personal body attitudes questions and a child-oriented version of the Implicit Association Test. Results: Our participants showed important prejudice and stereotypes against overweight children, both at the explicit and implicit levels. However, we found important differences in the intensity of prejudice and its developmental course as a function of the tasks and the type of measurement used to assess it. Conclusions: Children who grow up in Western societies idealize thinness from an early age and denigrate overweight, to which they associate explicitly and implicitly a series of negative traits that have nothing to do with the weight. As they grow older, they seem to reduce their levels of explicit prejudice, but not the intensity of implicit bias. More research is needed to study in depth prejudice and discrimination toward overweight children from a developmental point of view. Copyright © 2010 S.

,Exposure In Vivo Of Obsessive-Compulsives Under Distracting And Attention-Focusing Conditions: Replication And Extension,"Exposure to feared situations has been found to result in decrement in subjective anxiety and heart rate (HR) for anxiety-disordered patients. In a preliminary study using a crossover design, obsessive-compulsives experienced less return of fear during in vivo exposure when attention was focused on their feared obsessional stimuli than when it was distracted from them. Thus, attention seemed to facilitate between-session but not within-session habituation. The present study was conducted to replicate and extend the previous investigation using a between-groups design. Seventeen obsessive-compulsives with washing rituals were exposed to their most feared contaminant for two consecutive 90-min sessions under either distracting (playing a video game) or attention-focusing (observing and discussing the contaminant) conditions. Consistent with our earlier findings, HR response reduced substantially during attention-focusing but remained elevated during distraction. However, on subjective anxiety greater reduction was observed in the distraction condition, particularly during the first exposure session. Results are discussed in light of findings by other investigators regarding procedural manipulations during exposure. © 1986.",doi,10.1016/0005-7967(86)90013-6,Scopus,Behaviour Research and Therapy,"Grayson J.B., Foa E.B., Stekette G.S.",1986,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Extent Of Lactic Anaerobic Metabolism In Handballers.,"The authors investigated lactic anaerobic metabolism in handball players during practice games. Seven players aged 18-21, belonging to second division league clubs, took part in the study. In the laboratory, VO2 max and the onset of blood lactate accumulation (OBLA) were determined with progressive maximal ergocycle tests. On the field, video recordings, cardiotelemetry, and rectal temperature measurements made during the first half of the game were used to quantify exertion. An intravenous catheter worn permanently was used to draw blood for lactate measurements at the 5th, 10th, 15th, 20th, and 30th min of play and after a 10-min rest period. The results confirmed earlier observations showing the need for an excellent maximal aerobic power and capacity in handballers. However, the maximal lactate levels observed (4-9 mmol X l-1) were above those that could be expected from samples drawn only at the end of play. These findings indicate that players must be trained to tolerate high lactate levels to preserve their maximal efficiency throughout the game. Finally, lactate production increased with player exertion and with increasing OBLA.",doi,10.1055/s-2008-1025641,pubmed,International journal of sports medicine,"Delamarche, P; Gratas, A; Beillot, J; Dassonville, J; Rochcongar, P; Lessard, Y",1987,NA,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Factors Underlying Male And Female Use Of Violent Video Games,"Research has consistently shown that males play violent video games more frequently than females, but factors underlying this gender gap have not been examined to date. This approach examines the assumption that males play violent video games more because they anticipate more enjoyment and less guilt from engaging in virtual violence than females. This may be because males are less empathetic, tend to morally justify physical violence more and have a greater need for sensation and aggression in video game play than females. Results of a path model based on survey data of 444 respondents and using multi-step multiple mediation analyses confirm these assumptions. Taken together, the findings of this study shed further light on the gender gap in violent video game use. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014.",doi,10.1177/1461444814533067,Scopus,New Media and Society,"Hartmann T., Möller I., Krause C.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Fair Play Doesn't Matter: Mep Modulation As A Neurophysiological Signature Of Status Quo Bias In Economic Interactions,"Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies show that watching others' movements enhances motor evoked potential (MEPs) amplitude of the muscles involved in the observed action (motor facilitation, MF). MF has been attributed to a mirror neuron system mediated mechanism, causing an excitability increment of primary motor cortex. It is still unclear whether the meaning an action assumes when performed in an interpersonal exchange context could affect MF.This study aims at exploring this issue by measuring MF induced by the observation of the same action coupled with opposite reward values (gain vs loss) in an economic game. Moreover, the interaction frame was manipulated by showing the same actions within different economic games, the Dictator Game (DG) and the Theft Game (TG). Both games involved two players: a Dictator/Thief and a receiver. Experimental participants played the game always as receivers whereas the Dictator/Thief roles were played by our confederates. In each game Dictator/Thief's choices were expressed by showing a grasping action of one of two cylinders, previously associated with fair/unfair choices. In the DG the dictator decides whether to share (gain condition) or not (no-gain condition) a sum of money with the receiver, while in TGs the thief decides whether to steal (loss condition) or not to steal (no-loss condition) it from the participants. While the experimental subjects watched the videos showing these movements, a single TMS pulse was delivered to their motor hand area and a MEP was recorded from the right FDI muscle.Results show that, in the DG, MF was enhanced by the status quo modification, i.e. MEP amplitude increased when the dictator decided to change the receivers' status quo and share his/her money, and this was true when the status quo was more salient. The same was true for the TG, where the reverse happened: MF was higher for trials in which the thief decided to steal the participants' money, thus changing the status quo, in the block in which the status quo maintenance occurred more often. Data support the hypothesis that the economic meaning of the observed actions differently modulates MEP amplitude, pointing at an influence on MF exerted by a peculiar interaction between economic outcomes and variation of the subjects' initial status quo. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",doi,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.06.056,Scopus,NeuroImage,"Pisoni A., Lo Gerfo E., Ottone S., Ponzano F., Zarri L., Vergallito A., Romero Lauro L.J.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Family History Of Hypertension And Left Ventricular Mass In Youth: Possible Mediating Parameters,"Whether positive family history (FH) of essential hypertension (EH) in normotensive youth is associated with increased left ventricular mass (LVM) and hemodynamic, anthropometric, and demographic parameters previously associated with increased LVM in adults is unknown. To examine these issues, 323 healthy youth (mean age, 13.6 ± 1.3 years), 194 with positive FH of EH (61% African Americans, 39% whites) and 129 with negative FH of EH (33% African Americans, 67% whites) were evaluated. Hemodynamics were measured at rest and during four stressors (ie, postural change, car driving simulation, video game, forehead cold). Echocardiographic-derived measures of LVM were indexed separately to body surface area and height2.7. Controlling for age and race differences (ie, 74% of African Americans v 47% of whites had positive FH), the positive FH group exhibited greater LVM/height2.7, LVM/body surface area, higher systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressures (DBP), and total peripheral resistance index (TPRI) and lower cardiac index at rest (P &lt; .05 for all). The positive FH group also displayed higher peak SBP or DBP and higher TPRI increases to each stressor and came from lower socioeconomic status backgrounds (P &lt; .05 for all). Regression analyses indicated that FH of EH was not a significant determinant of LVM/height2.7 after accounting for contributions of gender (greater in men), general adiposity, resting cardiac index and blood pressure (BP), and TPRI responsivity to video game and cold stimulation (P &lt; .05 for all). Thus, greater LVM index in positive FH of EH youth appears in part related to their greater BP and TPRI at rest and during stress. © 2001 American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd.",doi,10.1016/S0895-7061(00)01275-9,Scopus,American Journal of Hypertension,"Cook B.B., Treiber F.A., Mensah G., Jindal M., Davis H.C., Kapuku G.K.",2001,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Feedback-Based Event-Driven Parts Moving,"A collection of unactuated disk-shaped ""parts"" must be brought by an actuated manipulator robot into a specified configuration from arbitrary initial conditions. The task is cast as a noncooperative game played among the parts - which in turn yields a feedback-based event-driven approach to plan generation and execution. The correctness of this approach, an open question, has been demonstrated in simpler settings and is further suggested by the extensive experiments reported here using an actual working implementation with EDAR - a mobile robot operating in a purely feedback-based event-driven manner.

,"Fight Fire With Rainbows: The Effects Of Displayed Violence, Difficulty, And Performance In Digital Games On Affect, Aggression, And Physiological Arousal","There is a large amount of variables that need to be taken into account when studying the effects of violent content in digital games; one of those being difficulty. In the current study participants played a modified first-person shooter in one of four different conditions, with either high or low difficulty and high or low violent game content. We assessed number of kills and number of deaths as game performance. Neither the difficulty nor the displayed violence had an effect on psychophysiological arousal during play, post-game aggressive cognitions, nor aggressive behavior. Thus, this study corroborates previous research indicating that violence in games does not substantially influence human behavior or experience, and other game characteristics deserve more attention in game effects studies. In addition, findings showed that challenge manipulated by game difficulty is of main importance for post-game emotions: Number of deaths predicted positive affect, but only in the low difficulty condition while number of kills was a positive predictor for positive affect and a negative predictor for negative affect. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

,Fmri Study Of Social Anxiety During Social Ostracism With And Without Emotional Support,"Social anxiety is characterized by an excessive fear of being embarrassed in social interactions or social performance situations. Emotional support can help to decrease or diminish social distress. Such support may play an important role at different points of social interaction. However, it is unclear how the beneficial effects of social support are represented in the brains of socially anxious individuals. To explore this, we used the same paradigm previously used to examine the effects of emotional support on social pain caused by exclusion. Undergraduates (n = 46) showing a wide range of social anxiety scores underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while participating in a Cyberball game. Participants were initially included and later excluded from the game. In the latter half of the session in which participants were excluded, they were provided with supportive messages. In line with our previous work, we found that social exclusion led to increased anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activity, whereas emotional support led to increased left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) activity. Despite validation of the paradigm, social anxiety was not associated with increased ACC activity during social exclusion, or during perceived emotional support. Instead, fear of negative evaluation as assessed by the Brief Fear of Negative Evaluation (BFNE) scale showed positive associations with left DLPFC activation while receiving emotional support, compared to while being socially excluded. The more socially anxious an individual was, the greater was the left DLPFC activity increased during receipt of messages. This suggests that highly socially anxious people still have the ability to perceive social support, but that they are nevertheless susceptible to negative evaluation by others. © 2015 Nishiyama et al.

,Fnirs Evidence Of Prefrontal Regulation Of Frustration In Early Childhood,"The experience of frustration is common in early childhood, yet some children seem to possess a lower tolerance for frustration than others. Characterizing the biological mechanisms underlying a wide range of frustration tolerance observed in early childhood may inform maladaptive behavior and psychopathology that is associated with this construct. The goal of this study was to measure prefrontal correlates of frustration in 3-5-year-old children, who are not readily adaptable for typical neuroimaging approaches, using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). fNIRS of frontal regions were measured as frustration was induced in children through a computer game where a desired and expected prize was ""stolen"" by an animated dog. A fNIRS general linear model (GLM) was used to quantify the correlation of brain regions with the task and identify areas that were statistically different between the winning and frustrating test conditions. A second-level voxel-based ANOVA analysis was then used to correlate the amplitude of each individual's brain activation with measure of parent-reported frustration. Experimental results indicated increased activity in the middle prefrontal cortex during winning of a desired prize, while lateral prefrontal cortex activity increased during frustration. Further, activity increase in lateral prefrontal cortex during frustration correlated positively with parent-reported frustration tolerance. These findings point to the role of the lateral prefrontal cortex as a potential region supporting the regulation of emotion during frustration. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",doi,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.04.057,Scopus,NeuroImage,"Perlman S.B., Luna B., Hein T.C., Huppert T.J.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Frequency And Electrode Discrimination In Children With Cochlear Implants,"The objective of this study was to develop reliable pediatric psychophysical methodologies in order to address the limits of frequency and electrode discrimination in children with cochlear implants. Discrimination was measured with a two-alternative, adaptive, forced choice design using a video game graphical user interface. Implanted children were compared to normal-hearing children in the same age ranges. Twenty-nine implanted children and 68 children with normal-hearing performed frequency discrimination studies at varying frequencies. Electrode discrimination was assessed in thirty-four implanted children at varying electrode locations and stimulation intensities. Older children had better frequency discrimination than younger children, both for implanted and hearing subjects. Implanted children had worse frequency discrimination overall and exhibited learning effects at older ages than hearing children. Frequency discrimination Weber fractions were smallest in low frequencies. Electrode discrimination improved with stimulus intensity level for older but not younger children at all electrode locations. These results support the premise that developmental changes in signal processing contribute to discrimination of simple acoustic stimuli. For implanted children, auditory discrimination improved at lower frequencies and with electrodes at higher intensity. These findings imply that spatial separation may not be the key determinant in creating discriminable electrical stimuli for this population. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",doi,10.1016/j.heares.2010.05.006,Scopus,Hearing Research,"Kopelovich J.C., Eisen M.D., Franck K.H.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali

,Frontal Midline Theta Rhythm And Eyeblinking Activity During A Vdt Task And A Video Game: Useful Tools For Psychophysiology In Ergonomics,"The necessity of psychophysiological research in ergonomics has gradually been recognized in Japan. In this paper, frontal midline theta rhythm (Fm-theta) and eyeblinking are recommended as tools in this field, especially for assessing workers' attention concentration, mental workload, fatigue, and interest during VDT work at the workplace and playing video games at home. In experiment 1, Fm-theta and eyeblink rates were measured in 10 Japanese abacus experts (Group E) and 10 normal students (Group C) during a visual search task with VDT. Memory load affected all measures. The amount of Fm-theta appeared more in Group E than Group C, but blink rate was lower in Group E than in Group C, As abacus experts have such highly developed skills in concentration, the result indicates that the amount of Fm-theta would be a good index of attention concentration in VDT workers. The second experiment was done with 10 school-aged children as subjects during three visual tasks: video game, mental test and animation. Amounts of Fm-theta and the degree of blink inhibition were maximum while playing the video game, which all subjects reported they most preferred, and minimum while watching animation, which eight subjects reported to be most boring. An interesting task would seem to provoke Fm-theta and inhibit eyeblink activity. From these two experiments, Fm-theta and eyeblink rate would appear to be good indices of attention concentration and task pleasantness of a mental task using VDT.The necessity of psychophysiological research in ergonomics has gradually been recognized in Japan.

,Fusing Visual And Behavioral Cues For Modeling User Experience In Games,"Estimating affective and cognitive states in conditions of rich human-computer interaction, such as in games, is a field of growing academic and commercial interest. Entertainment and serious games can benefit from recent advances in the field as, having access to predictors of the current state of the player (or learner) can provide useful information for feeding adaptation mechanisms that aim to maximize engagement or learning effects. In this paper, we introduce a large data corpus derived from 58 participants that play the popular Super Mario Bros platform game and attempt to create accurate models of player experience for this game genre. Within the view of the current research, features extracted both from player gameplay behavior and game levels, and player visual characteristics have been used as potential indicators of reported affect expressed as pairwise preferences between different game sessions. Using neuroevolutionary preference learning and automatic feature selection, highly accurate models of reported engagement, frustration, and challenge are constructed (model accuracies reach 91%, 92%, and 88% for engagement, frustration, and challenge, respectively). As a step further, the derived player experience models can be used to personalize the game level to desired levels of engagement, frustration, and challenge as game content is mapped to player experience through the behavioral and expressivity patterns of each player. © 2013 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TCYB.2013.2271738,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,"Shaker N., Asteriadis S., Yannakakis G.N., Karpouzis K.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Game-Theoretic Modeling And Control Of Military Operations With Partially Emotional Civilian Players,"Civilians are not just passively static but might purposefully take actions to help one side in a battle.

Strength Cond. Res. 21(3):909-914.2007. - The aim of this study was to describe the game characteristics and energy requirement in elite squash. Seven players (ranked 1-25 in their national federation, including the world number 1) performed a squash-specific incremental test to volitional exhaustion and 3 squash ga mes simulating competition. Pulmonary gas exchanges, heart ra te (HR), and blood lactate concentration ([LA]) were recorded by portable analyzers. Energy expenditure (EEV̇o2 ) was evaluated by indirect calorimetry. Temporal structure was determined from video recordings. The mean oxygen uptake (V̇o2), HR, EEV̇o2, and [LA] were 54.4 ± 4.8 ml·min-1·kg-1 (86 ± 9% of V̇o2max reached in the incremental squash test), 177 ± 10 beats·min-1 (92 ± 3% of HRmax), 4,933 ± 620 kJ·h-1, and 8.3 ± 3.4 mmol·L-1, respectively. Time spent &gt;90% of V̇o3max and HRmax was 24 ± 29% and 69 ± 18% of the total match duration, respectively. [LA] was correlated (R = 0.87; p = 0.01) with time spent &gt;90% of V̇o 2max. The mean rally duration yielded 18.6 ± 4.6 s, and 34.6% of the rallies were &lt;10 s, and 32.6% were &gt;21 s. The effective playing time was 69.7 ± 4.7%. World-standard squash is predominantly a high-intensity aerobic activity with great emphasize on the anaerobic energy systems and a high uncertainty in the course of match play. To improve squash results, coaches should plan training according to the characteristics of the sport. By showing the contribution of the different energy pathways and variables easily controllable during training sessions (e.g., HR, rally duration, lactate), the accurate prescription of conditioning session is improved. © 2007 National Strength &amp; Conditioning Association.",doi,10.1519/R-20306.1,Scopus,Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research,"Girard O., Chevalier R., Habrard M., Sciberras P., Hot P., Millet G.P.",2007,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali

,Gender Differences In Cardiovascular Reactivity And Game Performance Related To Sensory Modality In Violent Video Game Play,"This study examined the gender-specific cardiovascular and performance responses to playing the violent video game ""DOOM"" with and without the soundtrack. Men and women equally rated the game as more violent with the soundtrack. Men performed the game about twice as well with the soundtrack. Women's performance did not change at all. Only men's heart rates were significantly greater with the soundtrack, indicative of arousal. Only women's systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly greater with the soundtrack, indicative of stress. The game seemed to appeal more to men than to women. Moreover, women may possibly avoid violent video games, in part because they represent an undesirable stressor. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing, Inc.",doi,10.1111/j.1559-1816.2007.00248.x,Scopus,Journal of Applied Social Psychology,Tafalla R.J.,2007,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Gibberish Speech As A Tool For The Study Of Affective Expressiveness For Robotic Agents,"Recent technological advancements bring virtual agents, avatars, and social robotic characters into our daily lives. These characters must acquire the ability to express (simulated) emotions vocally and gesturally. In the vocal channel, Natural Language Interaction technologies today have some limitations when used in real-world natural environments and the models of expressivity of text to speech synthesis engines are not yet mature enough. To address these limitations, an alternative form of vocal communication - gibberish speech - is introduced in this paper. Gibberish speech consists of vocalizations of meaningless strings of speech sounds, and thus has no semantic meaning. It is occasionally used by performing artists or for cartoon animations and games to express intended emotions (e.g. Teletubbies and The Sims). In this paper, our approach for constructing expressive gibberish speech is described and the experimental evaluations with its intended robotic agents are reported. It is shown that the generated gibberish speech can contribute to a significant extent to studies concerning emotion expression for robotic agents and can be further utilized in affective human-robot interaction studies. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",doi,10.1007/s11042-014-2165-1,Scopus,Multimedia Tools and Applications,"Yilmazyildiz S., Verhelst W., Sahli H.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,"Graphic Gambling Warnings: How They Affect Emotions, Cognitive Responses And Attitude Change","The present study focuses on the effects of graphic warnings related to excessive gambling. It is based upon a theoretical model derived from both the Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) and the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM). We focus on video lottery terminal (VLT), one of the most hazardous format in the gaming industry. Our cohort consisted of 103 actual gamblers who reported previous gambling activity on VLT's on a regular basis. We assess the effectiveness of graphic warnings vs. text-only warnings and the effectiveness of two major arguments (i.e., family vs. financial disruption). A 2 × 2 factorial design was used to test the direct and combined effects of two variables (i.e., warning content and presence vs. absence of a graphic). It was found that the presence of a graphic enhances both cognitive appraisal and fear, and has positive effects on the Depth of Information Processing. In addition, graphic content combined with family disruptions is more effective for changing attitudes and complying with the warning than other combinations of the manipulated variables. It is proposed that ELM and PMT complement each other to explain the effects of warnings. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",doi,10.1007/s10899-012-9319-8,Scopus,Journal of Gambling Studies,"Muñoz Y., Chebat J.-C., Borges A.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Graphics Processing Unit-Based Bioheat Simulation To Facilitate Rapid Decision Making Associated With Cryosurgery Training,"This study focuses on the implementation of an efficient numerical technique for cryosurgery simulations on a graphics processing unit as an alternative means to accelerate runtime. This study is part of an ongoing effort to develop computerized training tools for cryosurgery, with prostate cryosurgery as a developmental model. The ability to perform rapid simulations of various test cases is critical to facilitate sound decision making associated with medical training. Consistent with clinical practice, the training tool aims at correlating the frozen region contour and the corresponding temperature field with the target region shape. The current study focuses on the feasibility of graphics processing unit-based computation using C++ accelerated massive parallelism, as one possible implementation. Benchmark results on a variety of computation platforms display between 3-fold acceleration (laptop) and 13-fold acceleration (gaming computer) of cryosurgery simulation, in comparison with the more common implementation on a multicore central processing unit. While the general concept of graphics processing unit-based simulations is not new, its application to phase-change problems, combined with the unique requirements for cryosurgery optimization, represents the core contribution of the current study. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.",doi,10.1177/1533034615580694,Scopus,Technology in Cancer Research and Treatment,"Keelan R., Zhang H., Shimada K., Rabin Y.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Gt-Cfs: A Game Theoretic Coalition Formulation Strategy For Reducing Power Loss In Micro Grids,"In recent years, research attention on smart grid comprising distributed power generators has increased. To produce electricity in the smart grid, many micro grids (MGs) may exploit various renewable energy resources. Because the production capacity of renewable resources cannot be controlled, the MGs often require the power plants to provide power for them. However, the power loss between each MG and the power plant is larger than that among the MGs. To alleviate this power loss, we propose a game theoretic coalition formulation strategy for the MGs dubbed GT-CFS. Our proposed GT-CFS allows the MGs (belonging to the same macro station (MS)) to autonomously cooperate and self-organize into a partition composed of disjoint MG coalitions. Also, GT-CFS enables the MGs, in a distributed manner, to decide whether they will remain in the coalitions or not upon environmental changes, e.g., the variation of the power demand of the MGs. Within every coalition, MGs coordinate the power transfer among themselves as well as with the MS, in a fashion to optimize a utility function, which captures the total losses over the power distribution lines. MGs in the same coalition will distribute the extra profits (i.e., payoff) produced from forming coalitions by their 'Shapley value.' Through computer simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed GT-CFS reduces the average power loss per MG significantly in contrast with the conventional noncooperative approach. © 2013 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TPDS.2013.178,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,"Wei C., Fadlullah Z.M., Kato N., Takeuchi A.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Health Status And Behavior Among Middle-School Children In A Midwest Community: What Are The Underpinnings Of Childhood Obesity?,"Background: Childhood obesity is one of the nation's foremost health challenges. How much of this is due to lifestyle choices? The objective of the study was to determine health behaviors that contribute to obesity in sixth-grade children. Methods: To assess which health habits contribute to childhood obesity, we studied body mass index, blood pressure, lipid profile, glucose, and heart rate recovery after a 3-minute step test among sixth-grade children enrolled in a school-based intervention study from 2004 to 2009, comparing health behaviors and physiologic markers in obese versus nonobese children. Univariate associations with obesity (P values ≤.10) were entered into a stepwise logistic regression to identify independent predictors. Results: Among 1,003 sixth graders (55% white, 15% African American; average age 11.5 years), 150 (15%) were obese. Obese students had higher levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, blood pressure, and recovery heart rates. They consumed more regular soda and school lunches but were less likely to engage in physical activities. Obese students were more likely to watch TV ≥2 hours per day. Independent predictors were watching TV or video games (odds ratio [OR] 1.19, 95% CI 1.06-1.33) and school lunch consumption (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.02-1.64); moderate exercise was protective (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82-0.98). Conclusions: Obesity is present in 15% of our sixth graders and is associated with major differences in cardiovascular risk factors. Opportunities to improve childhood health should emphasize programs that increase physical activity, reduce recreational screen time, and improve nutritional value of school lunches. Whether genetic or not, childhood obesity can be attacked. © 2010 Mosby, Inc.",doi,10.1016/j.ahj.2010.09.019,Scopus,American Heart Journal,"Eagle T.F., Gurm R., Goldberg C.S., Durussel-Weston J., Kline-Rogers E., Palma-Davis L., Aaronson S., Fitzgerald C.M., Mitchell L.R., Rogers B., Bruenger P., Jackson E.A., Eagle K.A.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Heart Rate Reactivity To Laboratory Tasks And Ambulatory Heart Rate In Daily Life,"This study investigated relationships between laboratory task-related heart rate reactivity and ambulatory heart rate responses and variability during daily life. Sixty-two healthy, young men completed one laboratory session consisting of pretask rest, reaction time, video game, and mental arithmetic, and one 24-hour ambulatory heart rate monitoring day. After controlling for ambulatory physical activity, laboratory reactivity measured as basal-to-task increase correlated significantly with ambulatory minimum, mean, and maximum increases from basal during wakefulness and with awake mean square successive difference. After controlling for ambulatory physical activity, laboratory reactivity measured as pretask-to-task increase correlated significantly only with awake mean square successive difference. These results support the hypothesis that individual differences in heart rate responses to laboratory tasks reflect similar differences in heart rate responses and variability during daily life. Results are compared in their degree of support for two theoretical models describing the generalization of individual differences in laboratory reactivity to reactivity during daily life.",doi,10.1097/00006842-199101000-00003,Scopus,Psychosomatic Medicine,Pollak M.H.,1991,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Hostility Among Adolescents In Switzerland. Multivariate Relations Between Excessive Media Use And Forms Of Violence.,"purpose To determine what kind of violence-related behavior or opinion is directly related to excessive media use among adolescents in Switzerland.
Methods A national representative sample of 4222 schoolchildren (7th- and 8th-graders; mean age 13.9 years) answered questions on the frequency of television-viewing, electronic game-playing, feeling unsafe at school, bullying others, hitting others, and fighting with others, as part of the Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children (HBSC) international collaborative study protocol. The Chi-square tests and multiple logistic regression analyses were applied to high-risk groups of adolescents. Results For the total sample, all bivariate relationships between television-viewing/electronic game-playing and each violence-related variable are significant. In the multivariate comparison, physical violence among boys ceases to be significant. For girls, only television-viewing is linked to indirect violence. Against the hypothesis, females’ electronic game-playing only had a bearing on hitting others. Conclusions Experimental designs are needed that take into account gender, different forms of media, and violence to answer the question of whether excessive media use leads to violent behavior. With the exception of excessive electronic game-playing among girls, this study found that electronic media are not thought to lead directly to real-life violence but to hostility and indirect violence.",doi,10.1016/j.jadohealth.2003.05.001,anderson2010,Journal of Adolescent Health,"Kuntsche, E.

,Human-Computer Interface Studies For Semi-Autonomous Unmanned Surface Vessels,"A series of four experiments were performed during an iterative design evolution of the human-computer interface (HCI) to a small unmanned surface vehicle (USV). The baseline control system was compared to several alternate designs using a simulated naval mission. User tasks included the monitoring and control of one or two vessels simultaneously. Faults and hazards were included to stimulate emergency responses during vessel transit. Alternate HCI designs varied across these factors: visual integration, synthetic audio feedback, sizing and placement of alerts, and use of a hand-held game controller as a primary input device. Results for N=32 sailors across the four studies indicated that for single or dual USV control conditions, the interface features added to the baseline design significantly improved speed and accuracy across multiple mission tasks. However, all design configurations still yielded some collision errors indicating that operator visual monitoring and manual control may be inadequate in complex, cluttered transit environments. Therefore, on-board automatic obstacle avoidance systems may be needed to safely support multiple vessel operations in cluttered complex transit environments. © 2015 The Authors",doi,10.1016/j.promfg.2015.07.154,Scopus,Procedia Manufacturing,"Osga G.A., McWilliams M.R.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Humans Deceived By Predatory Stealth Strategy Camouflaging Motion.,"Motion camouflage is a stealth strategy that allows a predator to conceal its apparent motion as it approaches a moving prey. Although male hoverflies have been observed to move in a manner consistent with motion camouflage to track females, the successful application of the technique has not previously been demonstrated. This article describes the implementation and results of a psychophysical experiment suggesting that humans are susceptible to motion camouflage. The experiment masqueraded as a computer-game competition. The basis of the competition was a game designed to test the comparative success of different predatory-approach strategies. The experiment showed that predators were able to approach closer to their prey (the player of the game) before being detected when using motion camouflage than when using other approach strategies tested. For an autonomous predator, the calculation of a motion-camouflage approach is a non-trivial problem. It was, therefore, of particular interest that in the game the players were deceived by motion-camouflage predators controlled by artificial neural systems operating using realistic levels of input information. It is suggested that these results are especially of interest to biologists, visual psychophysicists, military engineers and computer-games designers.",doi,10.1098/rsbl.2003.0030,pubmed,Proceedings.

,Imitation Learning Of Car Driving Skills With Decision Trees And Random Forests,"Machine learning is an appealing and useful approach to creating vehicle control algorithms, both for simulated and real vehicles. One common learning scenario that is often possible to apply is learning by imitation, in which the behavior of an exemplary driver provides training instances for a supervised learning algorithm. This article follows this approach in the domain of simulated car racing, using the TORCS simulator. In contrast to most prior work on imitation learning, a symbolic decision tree knowledge representation is adopted, which combines potentially high accuracy with human readability, an advantage that can be important in many applications. Decision trees are demonstrated to be capable of representing high quality control models, reaching the performance level of sophisticated pre-designed algorithms. This is achieved by enhancing the basic imitation learning scenario to include active retraining, automatically triggered on control failures. It is also demonstrated how better stability and generalization can be achieved by sacrificing human-readability and using decision tree model ensembles. The methodology for learning control models contributed by this article can be hopefully applied to solve real-world control tasks, as well as to develop video game bots. © 2014 by Paweł Cichosz.",doi,10.2478/amcs-2014-0042,Scopus,International Journal of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science,"Cichosz P., Pawełczak L.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Impact Of A Web Based Interactive Simulation Game (Pulse) On Nursing Students' Experience And Performance In Life Support Training - A Pilot Study,"The delivery of effective life support measures is highly associated with the quality, design and implementation of the education that underpins it. Effectively responding to a critical event is a requirement for all nurses illustrating the need for effective educational approaches from pre-registration training through to enhancing and maintaining life support skills after qualification. This paper reports the findings of utilising a web-based multimedia simulation game PULSE (Platform for Undergraduate Life Support Education). The platform was developed to enhance the student experience of life support education, to motivate on-going learning and engagement and to improve psychomotor skills associated with the provision of Intermediate Life Support (ILS) training. Pre training participants played PULSE and during life support training data was collected from an intervention and a control group of final year undergraduate nursing students (N = 34). Quantitative analysis of performance took place and qualitative data was generated from a questionnaire assessing the learning experience. A statistically significant difference was found between the competence the groups displayed in the three skills sets of checking equipment, airway assessment and the safe/effective use of defibrillator at ILS level, and PULSE was positively evaluated as an educational tool when used alongside traditional life support training. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.nedt.2011.09.013,Scopus,Nurse Education Today,"Cook N.F., McAloon T., O'Neill P., Beggs R.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali

,Implementation Of A Multiagent Systems For Competitive Environments On The Www,"Agents have been receiving a lot of attention as software which behaves autonomously and efficiently on a network and supports human social interactions. Various agent systems have already been proposed. A conventional agent-based system is based on the assumption that all interacting agents are trustworthy. In practice, however, there are many instances in which agents must compete in an environment in which the other agents cannot be trusted. Thus, in this paper the authors discuss the development of an electronic commerce system which uses agents that behave competitively. The agents in this system can determine autonomously the level of uncertainty in a transaction, then make decisions flexibly. In addition, the authors argue for the validity of their system using operational examples in which their system is used in various market scenarios.",doi,10.1002/scj.10032,Scopus,Systems and Computers in Japan,"Onjo H., Far B.H.",2002,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Improved Metabolic And Cardiorespiratory Fitness During A Recreational Training Program In Obese Children,"Physical activity may protect from the adverse effects of obesity. In obese children, an increased adherence and a decreased drop-out rate during exercise could be achieved with adaptated activities. We studied a recreational 12-week controlled training program for sedentary obese children, including interactive video games. We enrolled 22 obese subjects (13.23±1.76 years) in an exercise program, implemented twice a week for a 12-week period. The program consisted of a combination of circuit-based aerobics, strength and resistance exercises; specifically soccer, rugby, volleyball and basketball and interactive video game exercises. Outcome measurements included body composition, metabolic profile and cardiorespiratory fitness. During the 12-week training program there was a significant decrease in body mass index (BMI) (p=0.002), SDS-BMI (p=0.003), waist circumference (p=0.004), waist circumference/height ratio (p=0.001),% fat mass (p=0.001), blood glucose (p=0.001), homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (p=0.04), triglycerides (p=0.03) and systolic pressure (p=0.04) before and after exercise. Improvement in estimated maximum oxygen consumption (VO 2max ) (p &lt; 0.001) correlated with a decrease in fat mass (p=0.01), triglycerides (p=0.04) and insulin resistance (p=0.02). Exercise improved metabolic and cardiorespiratory fitness in obese children.

,Improving Empathic Communication Skills In Adults With Autism Spectrum Disorder,"The literature suggests that many individuals diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) experience challenges with recognizing and describing emotions in others, which may result in difficulties with the verbal expression of empathy during communication. Thus, there is a need for intervention techniques targeting this area. Using a multiple baseline across participants design, this study examined the effectiveness of a video-feedback intervention with a visual framework component to improve verbal empathetic statements and questions during conversation for adults with ASD. Following intervention, all participants improved in verbal expression of empathetic statements and empathetic questions during conversation with generalization and maintenance of gains. Furthermore, supplemental assessments indicated that each participant improved in their general level of empathy and confidence in communication skills. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",doi,10.1007/s10803-015-2633-0,Scopus,Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders,"Kern Koegel L., Ashbaugh K., Navab A., Koegel R.L.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Increased Frequency Of Social Interaction Is Associated With Enjoyment Enhancement And Reward System Activation,"Positive social interactions contribute to the sense that one's life has meaning. Enjoyment of feelings associated through social interaction motivates humans to build social connections according to their personal preferences. Therefore, we hypothesized that social interaction itself activates the reward system in a manner that depends upon individual interaction preferences. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study in which 38 participants played a virtual ball-toss game in which the number of ball tosses to the participant was either similar to (normal-frequency condition) or higher than (high-frequency condition) the number of tosses to the other players. Participants reported greater-than-anticipated enjoyment during the high-frequency condition, suggesting that receiving a social reward led to unexpected positive feelings. Consistent with this, the high-frequency condition produced stronger activation in the ventral striatum, which is part of the reward system, and the precuneus, representing positive self-image, which might be translated to social reward. Furthermore, ventral striatal activation covaried with individual participants' preference for interactions with others. These findings suggest that an elevated frequency of social interaction is represented as a social reward, which might motivate individuals to promote social interaction in a manner that is modulated by personal preference.",doi,10.1038/srep24561,Scopus,Scientific Reports,"Kawamichi H., Sugawara S.K., Hamano Y.H., Makita K., Kochiyama T., Sadato N.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Induced Mood And Persistence At Gaming,"Aims. Using the affect infusion model (AIM), this study aimed to assess the impact of prior mood on gaming persistence in regular and non-regular gamblers (assumed to be motivated and heuristic decision-makers, respectively). Design, measures and setting. A 2 × 3 experimental design in a laboratory setting employed factors of gambler type (regular, non-regular) and prior mood (happy, neutral, depressed). Measures were number of trials played on a gambling game, and mood ratings (post-mood induction, during and after play). Participants and intervention. Sixty regular and 60 non-regular gamblers (all male students) were assigned randomly to watch a video inducing one of the three mood conditions. They were then given AUD$10.00 to gamble in a computerized card-cutting game. Findings. AIM predictions were supported: prior mood did not affect gaming persistence for regular gamblers, but non-regulars showed reduced persistence across happy, neutral and depressed moods. After-play mood ratings were related to winnings for regulars, and losing regulars were significantly more unhappy after-play compared to during-play, and compared to both their winning counterparts and non-regulars. Mood and winnings were unrelated for non-regulars, with little during- to after-play mood change. Conclusions. The findings speak to depression as a causal factor in addictive gambling. Depressed mood did not enhance persistence in regular gamblers, but rather failed to have the inhibitory effect observed in non-regular gamblers. Evidence of mood changes during gambling was obtained, although multiple measures (self-report, physiological indicators, anticipated states) of both affective valence and arousal are advocated for future studies.",doi,10.1046/j.1360-0443.2001.961116299.x,Scopus,Addiction,"Hills A.M., Hill S., Mamone N., Dickerson M.",2001,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Integration Of Vision And Walking Skills Together With High-Level Strategies For Quadruped Robots To Play Soccer,"Legged robots taking part in real multi-agent activities represent a very innovative challenge. This domain of research requires developments in three main areas. First, without any feedback informationfrom the environment, there is no way for robots to achieve some tasks autonomously. Fortunately, the quadruped 'Sony' prototypes on which all experiments are carried out are equipped with an enhanced visionsystem; thanks to its CCD camera located in its head, the robot can obtain color images of the scene around it. Extracting relevant information from the images captured is not easy since it must be doneonboard in real time. Moreover, image treatment procedures should have high process rates for the robot to react quickly in front of unexpected events. A special vision module composed of three parts hasbeen designed for these purposes. The second point to focus on is the walking ability of the robot. Quadrupeds are designed to move efficiently and rapidly on flat ground. The objective of the walking moduleis to generate appropriate walking patterns allowing the machine to walk in the desired direction. Walking gaits are produced like reflexes by the robot itself to adapt to the situation. With regard tothe design of these gaits, emphasis has been put on increasing speed and mastering transitions. Finally, the machine should be given a minimum of intelligence since it has to manage vision information andits walking gaits by itself. When involved in situations of cooperation or competition or both, like in a soccer game, a high-level supervision task is welcome. This paper presents detailed developmentsof these three points and describes how they are implemented on a real robot. © 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",doi,10.1163/156855300741401,Scopus,Advanced Robotics,"Hugel V., Bonnin P., Bouramoué J.C., Blazevic P.",2e3,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,"Intelligent Adaptive Cyber-Physical Ecosystem For Aerospace Engineering Education, Training, And Accelerated Workforce Development","Transformative changes are on the horizon in aerospace engineering education and learning in general. These changes are attributable, in part, to the developments of a number of aerospace, learning and other leading-edge technologies and their synergistic combinations and convergence. The related technologies include ubiquitous, cloud, and petascale/exascale computing; ultrahigh-bandwidth networks; pervasive wireless communication; intelligent autonomous robotics; artificial general intelligence; powerful game engines and facilities; networked immersive virtual environments and virtual worlds; augmented and enhanced reality; and novel human-technology interfaces.

,Intention Modulates The Effect Of Punishment Threat In Norm Enforcement Via The Lateral Orbitofrontal Cortex,"Although economic theories suggest that punishment threat is crucial for maintaining social norms, counterexamples are noted in which punishment threat hinders norm compliance. Such discrepancy may arise from the intention behind the threat: unintentionally introduced punishment threat facilitates, whereas intentionally introduced punishment threat hinders, norm compliance. Here, we combined a dictator game and fMRI to investigate how intention modulates the effect of punishment threat on norm compliance and the neural substrates of this modulation. Wealso investigated whether this modulation can be influenced by brain stimulation. Humanparticipants divided an amount of money between themselves and a partner. The partner (intentionally) or a computer program (unintentionally) decided to retain or waive the right to punish the participant upon selfish distribution. Compared with the unintentional condition, participants allocated more when the partner intentionally waived the power of punishment, but less when the partner retained such power. The right lateral orbitofrontal cortex (rLOFC) showed higher activation when the partner waived compared with when the computer waived or when the partner retained the power. The functional connectivity between the rLOFC and the brain network associated with intention/mentalizing processing was predictive of the allocation difference induced by intention. Moreover, inhibition or activation of the rLOFC by brain stimulation decreased or increased, respectively, the participants’ reliance on the partner’s intention during monetary allocation. These findings demonstrate that the perceived intention of punishment threat plays a crucial role in norm compliance and that the LOFC is casually involved in the implementation of intention-based cooperative decisions. © 2016 the authors.",doi,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0595-16.2016,Scopus,Journal of Neuroscience,"Zhang Y., Yu H., Yin Y., Zhou X.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Interactive Effects Of Anger Expression And Et-1 Lys198asn Polymorphism On Vasoconstriction Reactivity To Behavioral Stress,"Background: Ineffective anger expression has been associated with essential hypertension (EH) and with blood pressure (BP) reactivity to stress. The ET-1/Lys198Asn polymorphism has been associated with increased resting BP and exaggerated vasoconstrictive mediated BP reactivity. African Americans (AAs) are at particular risk for development of EH, report greater anger difficulties, and exhibit greater vasoconstrictive reactivity than their European American (EA) counterparts. Purpose: The objective is to investigate a gene-environment model of stress reactivity in which anger expression, particularly in combination with ET-1 T allele carrier status and AA ethnicity, would be associated with the greatest vasoconstrictive reactivity in response to a behavioral stressor. Methods: One hundred ninety-one AA and 197 EA normotensive young adults (M age = 18.8 ± 2.5 years) participated in the study. Total peripheral resistance index (TPRI) reactivity was assessed during a 10-min video game challenge. Anger expression was measured using Spielberger's Anger Expression Scale. Results: A multiple regression model with TPRI reactivity as the dependent variable revealed a three-way interaction effect for anger management (i.e., AM = anger control minus anger out scores), ethnicity, and ET-1 polymorphism. Specifically, AA carriers of the ET-1 polymorphism with poor AM skills exhibited the greatest TPRI reactivity. Conclusions: Individuals with a genetic predisposition for exaggerated vasoconstriction who also display low AM skills may be at particular risk for development of stress-induced EH. Such individuals may particularly benefit from anger management training. © 2005 by The Society of Behavioral Medicine.",doi,10.1207/s15324796abm3001_10,Scopus,Annals of Behavioral Medicine,"Rabineau K.M., Treiber F.A., Poole J., Ludwig D.",2005,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Interactive Technologies For Autistic Children: A Review,"Recently, there have been considerable advances in the research on innovative information communication technology (ICT) for the education of people with autism. This review focuses on two aims: (1) to provide an overview of the recent ICT applications used in the treatment of autism and (2) to focus on the early development of imitation and joint attention in the context of children with autism as well as robotics. There have been a variety of recent ICT applications in autism, which include the use of interactive environments implemented in computers and special input devices, virtual environments, avatars and serious games as well as telerehabilitation. Despite exciting preliminary results, the use of ICT remains limited. Many of the existing ICTs have limited capabilities and performance in actual interactive conditions. Clinically, most ICT proposals have not been validated beyond proof of concept studies. Robotics systems, developed as interactive devices for children with autism, have been used to assess the child’s response to robot behaviors; to elicit behaviors that are promoted in the child; to model, teach and practice a skill; and to provide feedback on performance in specific environments (e.g., therapeutic sessions). Based on their importance for both early development and for building autonomous robots that have humanlike abilities, imitation, joint attention and interactive engagement are key issues in the development of assistive robotics for autism and must be the focus of further research. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",doi,10.1007/s12559-014-9276-x,Scopus,Cognitive Computation,"Boucenna S., Narzisi A., Tilmont E., Muratori F., Pioggia G., Cohen D., Chetouani M.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Interactive Video Dance Games For Healthy Older Adults,"Background: Physical activity promotes health in older adults but participation rates are low. Interactive video dance games can increase activity in young persons but have not been designed for use with older adults. The purpose of this research was to evaluate healthy older adults' interest and participation in a dance game adapted for an older user. Methods: Healthy older adults were recruited from 3 senior living settings and offered three months of training and supervision using a video dance game designed for older people. Before and after the program, data was collected on vital signs, physical function and self reported quality of life. Feedback was obtained during and after training. Results: Of 36 persons who entered (mean age 80.1 + 5.4 years, 83 % female), 25 completed the study. Completers were healthier than noncompleters. Completers showed gains in narrow walk time, self-reported balance confidence and mental health. While there were no serious adverse events, 4 of 11 noncompleters withdrew due to musculoskeletal complaints. Conclusions: Adapted Interactive video dance is feasible for some healthy older adults and may help achieve physical activity goals. © 2010 Serdi and Springer Verlag France.",doi,10.1007/s12603-010-0119-5,Scopus,"Journal of Nutrition, Health and Aging","Studenski S., Perera S., Hile E., Keller V., Spadola-Bogard J., Garcia J.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Interactive Video Game Cycling Leads To Higher Energy Expenditure And Is More Enjoyable Than Conventional Exercise In Adults,"Background: Despite the widely accepted health benefits of regular physical activity, only a small percentage of the population meets the current recommendations. The reasons include a wide use of technology and a lack of enjoyment while exercising. The purpose of this study was to compare the physiological, perceptual and enjoyment responses between a single bout of (I) conventional cycling and (II) interactive cycling video game at a matched workload. Methods: A cross-sectional study in 34 healthy participants was performed. Initially, participants completed an incremental maximal cycling test to measure peak oxygen uptake and to determine ventilatory threshold. In random order, participants carried out a 30 min interactive cycling trial and a 30 min conventional cycling trial at 55% of peak power output. During the trials, oxygen uptake and energy expenditure were measured by open-circuit spirometry and heart rate was measured by radiotelemetry. RPE and enjoyment were measured every 10 minutes with Borg scale and a modified PACES scale. Results: Interactive cycling resulted in a significantly greater %VO2Reserve (68.2% ± 9.2% vs 64.7% ± 8.1%), rate of energy expenditure (505.8±75.2 vs 487.4±81.2 j·kg-1·min-1), and enjoyment (63.4% ± 17 vs 42% ± 13.6), P<0.05. Participants were working at a higher intensity in relation to the individual's ventilatory threshold during the interactive cycling video game trial (M = 11.86, SE = 3.08) than during the Conventional cycling trial (M = 7.55, SE = 3.16, t(33) = -2.69, P<0.05, r =.42). No significant differences were found for heart rate reserve (72.5 ± 10.4 vs 71.4±10.1%) and RPE (13.1 ± 1.8 vs 13.2 ± 1.7). Conclusion: Interactive cycling games can be a valid alternative to conventional exercise as they result in a higher exercise intensity than conventional cycling and a distraction from aversive cognitive and physiological states at and above the ventilatory threshold. © 2015 Monedero et al.",doi,10.1371/journal.pone.0118470,Scopus,PLoS ONE,"Monedero J., Lyons E.J., O'Gorman D.J.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,"Internet Addiction, Psychological Distress, And Coping Responses Among Adolescents And Adults","As Internet use grows, so do the benefits and also the risks. Thus, it is important to identify when individuals' Internet use is problematic. In the present study, 449 participants aged from 16 to 71 years of age were sourced from a wide range of English-speaking Internet forums, including social media and self-help groups. Of these, 68.9% were classified as nonproblematic users, 24.4% as problematic users, and 6.7% as addictive Internet users. High use of discussion forums, high rumination levels, and low levels of self-care were the main contributing factors to Internet addiction (IA) among adolescents. For adults IA was mainly predicted through engagement in online video gaming and sexual activity, low email use, as well as high anxiety and high avoidant coping. Problematic Internet users scored higher on emotion and avoidance coping responses in adults and higher on rumination and lower on self-care in adolescents. Avoidance coping responses mediated the relationship between psychological distress and IA. These findings may assist clinicians with designing interventions to target different factors associated with IA. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",doi,10.1089/cyber.2016.0669,Scopus,"Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking","McNicol M.L., Thorsteinsson E.B.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,"Internet Game Addiction, Depression, And Escape From Negative Emotions In Adulthood: A Nationwide Community Sample Of Korea","The aim of this study was to investigate the association between adult Internet game addiction (IGA) and mental disorders. A total of 1401 adults aged between 18 and 74 years participated in this study. The IGA group had significantly younger patients, and it showed a higher proportion of unmarried and unemployed adults, and higher rates of suicidal ideation, plan, and attempt than the non-IGA group. Multivariate logistic regression indicated that IGA was significantly associated with major depressive disorder, dysthymia, and depressive disorders adjusting for all variables. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score was significantly higher in the IGA group than in the non-IGA group for both young adults and middle groups. ""Escape from negative emotions like nervousness, sadness, and anger"" was the only significant item associated with depression among symptoms of IGA. This study suggests that adults with IGA and depression may use Internet games to escape from negative emotions. Copyright © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

,"Intra-Individual Psychological And Physiological Responses To Acute Laboratory Stressors Of Different Intensity. Psychoneuroendocrinology, 51, 227–36.","The phenomenon of stress is understood as a multidimensional concept which can be captured by psychological and physiological measures. There are various laboratory stress protocols which enable stress to be investigated under controlled conditions. However, little is known about whether these protocols differ with regard to the induced psycho-physiological stress response pattern. METHODS: In a within-subjects design, 20 healthy young men underwent four of the most common stress protocols (Stroop test [Stroop], cold pressor test [CPT], Trier Social Stress Test [TSST], and bicycle ergometer test [Ergometer]) and a no-stress control condition (rest) in a randomized order. For the multidimensional assessment of the stress response, perceived stress, endocrine and autonomic biomarkers (salivary cortisol, salivary alpha-amylase, and heart rate) were obtained during the experiments. RESULTS: All stress protocols evoked increases in perceived stress levels, with the highest levels in the TSST, followed by Ergometer, Stroop, and CPT. The highest HPA axis response was found in the TSST, followed by Ergometer, CPT, and Stroop, whilst the highest autonomic response was found in the Ergometer, followed by TSST, Stroop, and CPT. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that different stress protocols differentially stimulate various aspects of the stress response. Physically demanding stress protocols such as the Ergometer test appear to be particularly suitable for evoking autonomic stress responses, whereas uncontrollable and social-evaluative threatening stressors (such as the TSST) are most likely to elicit HPA axis stress responses. The results of this study may help researchers in deciding which stress protocol to use, depending on the individual research question.",doi,10.1016/j.psyneuen.2014.10.002,nagy2015,Psychoneuroendocrinology,"Skoluda, N., Strahler, J., Schlotz, W., Niederberger, L., Marques, S., Fischer, S., … Nater, U.

,Intraoperative Image Navigation: Experimental Study Of The Feasibility And Surgeon Preference Between A Sterile Encased Nintendo Wiitm Remote And Standard Wireless Computer Mouse,"Diagnostic imaging plays an important role in the operating room, providing surgeons with a reference and surgical plan. Surgeon autonomy in the operating room has been suggested to decrease errors that stem from communication mistakes. A standard computer mouse was compared to a wireless remote-control style controller for computer game consoles (Wiimote) for the navigation of diagnostic imaging studies by sterile personnel in this prospective survey study. Participants were recruited from a cohort of residents and faculty that use the surgical suites at our institution. Outcome assessments were based on survey data completed by study participants following each use of either the mouse or Wiimote, and compared using an analysis of variance. The mouse was significantly preferred by the study participants in the categories of handling, accuracy and efficiency, and overall satisfaction (P <0.05). The mouse was preferred to both the Wiimote and to no device, when participants were asked to rank options for image navigation. This indicates the need for the implementation of intraoperative image navigation devices, to increase surgeon autonomy in the operating room. © 2017 American College of Veterinary Radiology",doi,10.1111/vru.12479,Scopus,Veterinary Radiology and Ultrasound,"Appleby R., zur Linden A., Sears W.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Intrinsic Motivation And Introspection In Reinforcement Learning,"Incorporating intrinsic motivation with reinforcement learning can permit agents to independently choose, which skills they will develop, or to change their focus of attention to learn different skills at different times. This implies an autonomous developmental process for skills in which a skill-acquisition goal is first identified, then a skill is learned to solve the goal. The learned skill may then be stored, reused, temporarily ignored or even permanently erased. This paper formalizes the developmental process for skills by proposing a goal-lifecycle using the option framework for motivated reinforcement learning agents. The paper shows how the goal-lifecycle can be used as a basis for designing motivational state-spaces that permit agents to reason introspectively and autonomously about when to learn skills to solve goals, when to activate skills, when to suspend activation of skills or when to delete skills. An algorithm is presented that simultaneously learns: 1) an introspective policy mapping motivational states to decisions that change the agent's motivational state, and 2) multiple option policies mapping sensed states and actions to achieve various domain-specific goals. Two variations of agents using this model are compared to motivated reinforcement learning agents without introspection for controlling non-player characters in a computer game scenario. Results show that agents using introspection can focus their attention on learning more complex skills than agents without introspection. In addition, they can learn these skills more effectively. © 2009-2011 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TAMD.2012.2208457,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Autonomous Mental Development,Merrick K.E.,2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Investigation Of Frontal Lobe Activation With Fnirs And Systemic Changes During Video Gaming.,"Frontal lobe activation caused by tasks such as videogames can be investigated using multichannel near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), sometimes called optical topography. The aims of this study are to investigate the effects of video gaming (fighting and puzzle games) in the brain and the systemic physiology and to determine whether systemic responses during the gaming task are associated with the measurement of localised cerebral haemodynamic changes as measured by fNIRS. We used a continuous-wave 8-channel fNIRS system to measure the changes in concentration of oxy-haemoglobin (HbO2) and deoxy-haemoglobin (HHb) and changes in total haemoglobin (ΔtHb = ΔHbO2 + ΔHHb) over the frontal lobe in 30 healthy volunteers. The Portapres system was used to measure mean blood pressure (MBP) and heart rate (HR), and a laser Doppler was employed to measure the changes in scalp blood flow (or flux). Even though we observed significant changes in systemic variables during gaming, in particular in scalp flow, we also managed to see localised activation patterns over the frontal polar (FP1) region. However, in some channels over the frontal lobe, we also observed significant correlations between the HbO2 and systemic variables.",doi,10.1007/978-1-4614-7411-1_13,pubmed,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,"Tachtsidis, Ilias; Papaioannou, Antonis",2014,NA,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,"Investigation Of The Relationship Between Social Isolation, Self-Esteem, Aggression And Computer Game Play In Japanese Adolescents.","Some support for expressed concern over the negative consequences of computer game play was obtained by Colwell and Payne (2000) in a questionnaire survey of UK adolescents. A second study was carried out in Tokyo, Japan, to test for generality of findings. There was strong evidence of similarity in relation to play patterns, but in contrast to the UK sample, number of good friends and self-esteem did not relate to game play. A principal components analysis of a scale to measure needs met by game play resulted in the same two previously obtained factors; ‘companionship’ and ‘prefer to friends’. However, in contrast to the UK sample, ‘companionship’ did not relate to play. A positive relation between the ‘prefer to friends’ factor and play was obtained for both boys and girls (boys only in the UK), thus providing support for the ‘electronic friendship’ hypothesis. There was evidence of a positive relation between play and aggression, but a preference for aggressive games was associated with lower aggression scores, and this raises questions for the ‘causal hypothesis’.",doi,10.1111/1467-839X.t01-1-00017,anderson2010,Asian Journal of Social Psychology,"Colwell, J., Kato, M.",2003,NA,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Involuntary Memories After A Positive Film Are Dampened By A Visuospatial Task: Unhelpful In Depression But Helpful In Mania?,"Spontaneous negative mental images have been extensively researched due to the crucial role they play in conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder. However, people can also experience spontaneous positive mental images, and these are little understood. Positive images may play a role in promoting healthy positive mood and may be lacking in conditions such as depression. However, they may also occur in problematic states of elevated mood, such as in bipolar disorder. Can we apply an understanding of spontaneous imagery gained by the study of spontaneous negative images to spontaneous positive images? In an analogue of the trauma film studies, 69 volunteers viewed an explicitly positive (rather than traumatic) film. Participants were randomly allocated post-film either to perform a visuospatial task (the computer game 'Tetris') or to a no-task control condition. Viewing the film enhanced positive mood and immediately post-film increased goal setting on a questionnaire measure. The film was successful in generating involuntary memories of specific scenes over the following week. As predicted, compared with the control condition, participants in the visuospatial task condition reported significantly fewer involuntary memories from the film in a diary over the subsequent week. Furthermore, scores on a recognition memory test at 1week indicated an impairment in voluntary recall of the film in the visuospatial task condition. Clinical implications regarding the modulation of positive imagery after a positive emotional experience are discussed. Generally, boosting positive imagery may be a useful strategy for the recovery of depressed mood. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",doi,10.1002/cpp.1800,Scopus,Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy,"Davies C., Malik A., Pictet A., Blackwell S.E., Holmes E.A.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Is The Relationship Between Sedentary Behaviour And Cardiometabolic Health In Adolescents Independent Of Dietary Intake? A Systematic Review,"Screen time, but not overall sedentary behaviour, is consistently related to cardiometabolic health in adolescents. Because of the associations screen time has with dietary intake, diet may be an important factor in the screen time and health relationship; however, evidence has not previously been synthesized. Thus, the aim of this systematic review was to explore whether the associations between various sedentary behaviours and cardiometabolic risk markers are independent of dietary intake in adolescents. Online databases and personal libraries were searched for peer-reviewed original research articles published in English before March 2014. Included studies assessed associations between sedentary behaviour and cardiometabolic markers in 12- to 18-year-olds and adjusted for dietary intake. Twenty-five studies met the inclusion criteria. From the 21 studies examining sedentary behaviour and adiposity, the majority found significant positive associations between television viewing, screen time and self-reported overall sedentary behaviour with markers of adiposity, independent of dietary intake. No significant associations between screen time with blood pressure and cholesterol were reported. Sedentary behaviour appears to be associated with adiposity in adolescents, irrespective of dietary intake. However, the variability of dietary variables between studies suggests further work is needed to understand the role of dietary intake when examining these associations in youth. © 2015 World Obesity.",doi,10.1111/obr.12302,Scopus,Obesity Reviews,"Fletcher E., Leech R., Mcnaughton S.A., Dunstan D.W., Lacy K.E., Salmon J.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Lean Adolescents Achieve Higher Intensities But Not Higher Energy Expenditure While Playing Active Video Games Compared With Obese Ones,"Background While decreased physical activity and increased sedentary behaviours are incriminated for their role in the progression of obesity, active video games (AVG) may offer a new alternative to increase energy expenditure in youth. This study is the first to examine the effect of a 1-h AVG play on lean and obese adolescents' energy expenditure. Methods Body composition and aerobic fitness were assessed in 19 obese and 12 lean adolescent boys (12-15 years old). Participants performed a 1-h AVG session (Kinect Sports technology) while wearing a portable indirect calorimeter (K4b2) to assess their energy expenditure and heart rate. Results Body weight (91.0 ± 9.5 vs. 58.5 ± 12.4 kg), body mass index (32.2 ± 3.1 vs. 20.3 ± 1.6 kg m-2) and body fat (38.1 ± 2.7 vs. 13.4 ± 3.9%) were significantly higher in obese adolescents (P &lt; 0.001). Absolute energy expenditure was significantly higher in obese (P &lt; 0.05) but not when corrected for body composition. Maximal heart rate reached during AVG was significantly higher in lean adolescents (190 ± 25 vs. 183 ± 28 bpm, P &lt; 0.05). Time spent between 3 and 6 METs (Metabolic Equivalent Task) was not different between groups but time spent above 6 METs was higher in lean adolescents (P &lt; 0.05). Conclusion Although lean and obese adolescent boys experienced similar energy expenditure relative to their body size during a 1-h Kinect AVG session, lean adolescents spent more time in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. © 2015 World Obesity.",doi,10.1111/ijpo.12027,Scopus,Pediatric Obesity,"Chaput J.P., Genin P.M., Le Moel B., Pereira B., Boirie Y., Duclos M., Thivel D.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Learning Sensor-Based Navigation Of A Real Mobile Robot In Unknown Worlds,"In this paper, we address the problem of navigating an autonomous mobile robot in an unknown indoor environment. The parti-game multiresolution learning approach is applied for simultaneous and cooperative construction of a world model, and learning to navigate through an obstacle-free path from a starting position to a known goal region. The paper introduces a new approach, based on the application of the fuzzy ART neural architecture, for on-line map building from actual sensor data. This method is then integrated, as a complement, on the parti-game world model, allowing the system to make a more efficient use of collected sensor information. Then, a predictive on-line trajectory filtering method, is introduced in the learning approach. Instead of having a mechanical device moving to search the world, the idea is to have the system analyzing trajectories in a predictive mode, by taking advantage of the improved world model. The real robot will only move to try trajectories that have been predicted to be successful, allowing lower exploration costs. This results in an overall improved new method for goal-oriented navigation. It is assumed that the robot knows its own current world location - a simple dead-reckoning method is used for localization in our experiments. It is also assumed that the robot is able to perform sensor-based obstacle detection (not avoidance) and straight-line motions. Results of experiments with a real Nomad 200 mobile robot will be presented, demonstrating the effectiveness of the discussed methods.",doi,10.1109/3477.752791,Scopus,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B: Cybernetics","Araújo R., De Almeida A.T.",1999,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Learning To Multitask: Effects Of Video Game Practice On Electrophysiological Indices Of Attention And Resource Allocation,"Changes in attention allocation with complex task learning reflect processing automatization and more efficient control. We studied these changes using ERP and EEG spectral analyses in subjects playing Space Fortress, a complex video game comprising standard cognitive task components. We hypothesized that training would free up attentional resources for a secondary auditory oddball task. Both P3 and delta EEG showed a processing trade-off between game and oddball tasks, but only some game events showed reduced attention requirements with practice. Training magnified a transient increase in alpha power following both primary and secondary task events. This contrasted with alpha suppression observed when the oddball task was performed alone, suggesting that alpha may be related to attention switching. Hence, P3 and EEG spectral data are differentially sensitive to changes in attentional processing occurring with complex task training.© 2011 Society for Psychophysiological Research.",doi,10.1111/j.1469-8986.2011.01189.x,Scopus,Psychophysiology,"Maclin E.L., Mathewson K.E., Low K.A., Boot W.R., Kramer A.F., Fabiani M., Gratton G.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Locally Noisy Autonomous Agents Improve Global Human Coordination In Network Experiments,"Coordination in groups faces a sub-optimization problem and theory suggests that some randomness may help to achieve global optima. Here we performed experiments involving a networked colour coordination game in which groups of humans interacted with autonomous software agents (known as bots). Subjects (n = 4,000) were embedded in networks (n = 230) of 20 nodes, to which we sometimes added 3 bots. The bots were programmed with varying levels of behavioural randomness and different geodesic locations. We show that bots acting with small levels of random noise and placed in central locations meaningfully improve the collective performance of human groups, accelerating the median solution time by 55.6%. This is especially the case when the coordination problem is hard. Behavioural randomness worked not only by making the task of humans to whom the bots were connected easier, but also by affecting the gameplay of the humans among themselves and hence creating further cascades of benefit in global coordination in these heterogeneous systems. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

,Logic-Based Robot Control In Highly Dynamic Domains,"In this paper, we present the robot programming and planning language Readylog, a Golog dialect, which was developed to support the decision making of robots acting in dynamic real-time domains, such as robotic soccer. The formal framework of Readylog, which is based on the situation calculus, features imperative control structures such as loops and procedures, allows for decision-theoretic planning, and accounts for a continuously changing world. We developed high-level controllers in Readylog for our soccer robots in RoboCup's Middle-size league, but also for service robots and for autonomous agents in interactive computer games. For a successful deployment of Readylog on a real robot it is also important to account for the control problem as a whole, integrating the low-level control of the robot (such as localization, navigation, and object recognition) with the logic-based high-level control. In doing so, our approach can be seen as a step towards bridging the gap between the fields of robotics and knowledge representation. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Results showed a significant increase from baseline in hostility and aggression (based on two of the three story stems), which is consistent with the General Aggression Model.

,Mario Becomes Cognitive,"In line with Allen Newell's challenge to develop complete cognitive architectures, and motivated by a recent proposal for a unifying subsymbolic computational theory of cognition, we introduce the cognitive control architecture SEMLINCS. SEMLINCS models the development of an embodied cognitive agent that learns discrete production rule-like structures from its own, autonomously gathered, continuous sensorimotor experiences. Moreover, the agent uses the developing knowledge to plan and control environmental interactions in a versatile, goal-directed, and self-motivated manner. Thus, in contrast to several well-known symbolic cognitive architectures, SEMLINCS is not provided with production rules and the involved symbols, but it learns them. In this paper, the actual implementation of SEMLINCS causes learning and self-motivated, autonomous behavioral control of the game figure Mario in a clone of the computer game Super Mario Bros. Our evaluations highlight the successful development of behavioral versatility as well as the learning of suitable production rules and the involved symbols from sensorimotor experiences. Moreover, knowledge- and motivation-dependent individualizations of the agents’ behavioral tendencies are shown. Finally, interaction sequences can be planned on the sensorimotor-grounded production rule level. Current limitations directly point toward the need for several further enhancements, which may be integrated into SEMLINCS in the near future.

,Match Analysis Of Elite Adolescent Team Handball Players,"Chelly, MS, Hermassi, S, Aouadi, R, Khalifa, R, Van den Tillaar, R, Chamari, K, and Shephard, RJ. Match analysis of elite adolescent team handball players. J Strength Cond Res 25(9): 2410-2417, 2011-The purposes of this study were to examine the activity profile of elite adolescent players during regular team handball games and to compare the physical and motor performance of players between the first and second halves of a match. Activity patterns (video analysis) and heartrate (HR) responses (telemetry) were monitored in top nationaldivision adolescent players (18 men, aged 15.1 ± 0.6 years) throughout 6 regulation games (25-minute halves with a 10- minute interval). The total distance covered a meraged 1,777 ± 264 m per game (7.4% less in the second than in the first half, p &gt; 0.05). Players ran 170 ± 24 m at high intensity and 866 12 m at maximal speed, with 3266 bouts of running (duration 2.36 0.3 seconds) at speeds &gt; 18 km·h -1; they stood still for 16% of the playing time. The mean HR during play was 172 ± 2 b·min -1 (82 ± 3% of maximal HR). Blood lactate concentrations at the end of the first and second halves were 9.7 ± 1.1 and 8.3 ± 0.9 mmol·L -1, respectively (difference p &lt; 0.05). We conclude that adolescent handball players cover less distance and engage in fewer technical actions in the second half of a match. This indicates that team handball is physiologically very demanding. The practical implication is that coaches should seek to sustain performance in the second period of a game by modifying playing tactics and maximizing both aerobic and anaerobic fi ness duringtraining sessions. © 2011 National Strength and Conditioning Association.",doi,10.1519/JSC.0b013e3182030e43,Scopus,Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research,"Chelly M.S., Hermassi S., Aouadi R., Khalifa R., Tillaar R.V.D., Chamari K., Shephard R.J.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Meaningful Video Games: Drama-Based Video Games As Transformational Experience,"The development of more meaningful video games is becoming increasingly possible by recent advances in video game technologies, neurosciences, and biofeedback. In the near future, meaningful video games will be designed to facilitate personal-psychological transformation. Unlike ""serious games"" that focus on education and ""conditioning"" the mind, meaningful games will cultivate emotional intelligence, somatic awareness, and archetypal integration in order to ""un-condition"" the mind and thereby facilitate psychologically meaningful personal transformations. Meaningful game research will access the dynamics of psychological transformation in order to enhance archetypal awareness, intuition, and insight on the part of players. Within the genre of meaningful video games, Drama-Based Games (DBG) add an unprecedented dimension for psychological engagement and decision-making. Because they extend psychological player immersion to the dimension of ""physical"" interactivity, (DBG) incorporate the full range of psychological functions defined by Carl Jung. Because psychological experiences are correlated with physiological processes, DBG may be used as research instruments for quantifying diverse biometric-psychological interactions that occur during game play. Advances in electronics now enable the real-time and non-intrusive capturing of physiological data such as brain waves (e.g., electroencephalography), heart-rate variability, skin response, and facial expression. This data can provide an objective basis for measuring dimensions of the cognitive unconscious in test subjects as they respond to game experiences. The ultimate goal of research is to provide veridical data relative to the psychological parameters of an increasingly mediated global environment-a Psychecology-and to study the ensuing world-view. © 2011, IGI Global.",doi,10.4018/978-1-60960-567-4.ch019,Scopus,"Business, Technological, and Social Dimensions of Computer Games: Multidisciplinary Developments","Schafer S.B., Yu G.",2011,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Measuring Game Engagement: Multiple Methods And Construct Complexity,"Background. Engagement has been identified as a crucial component of learning in games research. However, the conceptualization and operationalization of engagement vary widely in the literature. Many valuable approaches illuminate ways in which presence, flow, arousal, participation, and other concepts constitute or contribute to engagement. However, few studies examine multiple conceptualizations of engagement in the same project.Method. This article discusses the results of two experiments that measure engagement in five different ways: survey self-report, content analyses of player videos, electro-dermal activity, mouse movements, and game click logs. We examine the relationships among these measures and assess how they are affected by the technical characteristics of a 30-minute, custom-built, educational game: use of a customized character, level of narrative complexity, and level of art complexity.Results. We found that the five measures of engagement correlated in limited ways, and that they revealed substantially different relationships with game characteristics. We conclude that engagement as a construct is more complex than is captured in any of these measures individually and that using multiple methods to assess engagement can illuminate aspects of engagement not detectable by a single method of measurement. © 2014 SAGE Publications.",doi,10.1177/1046878114553575,Scopus,Simulation and Gaming,"Martey R.M., Kenski K., Folkestad J., Feldman L., Gordis E., Shaw A., Stromer-Galley J., Clegg B., Zhang H., Kaufman N., Rabkin A.N., Shaikh S., Strzalkowski T.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Media Enjoyment As Need Satisfaction: The Contribution Of Hedonic And Nonhedonic Needs,Most early research on entertainment defines media enjoyment in functional terms as the satisfaction of hedonic needs. Two studies demonstrate the value of including nonhedonic and hedonic need satisfaction in defining enjoyment. Both studies find support for a need-satisfaction model showing that hedonic (arousal and affect) and nonhedonic (competence and autonomy) need satisfaction account for unique variance in enjoyment experienced during video game play. Study 2 extends the findings of Study 1 to account for noninteractive media entertainment enjoyment. Results show hedonic and nonhedonic need satisfaction to be distinct but complementary components of media enjoyment. Discussion focuses on the advantage of a needs-based approach for understanding positive valuations of media and offers a new perspective on the enjoyment-appreciation distinction. © 2011 International Communication Association.,doi,10.1111/j.1460-2466.2011.01593.x,Scopus,Journal of Communication,"Tamborini R., Grizzard M., David Bowman N., Reinecke L., Lewis R.J., Eden A.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,"Mediators And Moderators Of Long-Term Effects Of Violent Video Games On Aggressive Behavior Practice, Thinking, And Action","IMPORTANCE Although several longitudinal studies have demonstrated an effect of violent video game play on later aggressive behavior, little is known about the psychological mediators and moderators of the effect. OBJECTIVE To determine whether cognitive and/or emotional variables mediate the effect of violent video game play on aggression and whether the effect is moderated by age, sex, prior aggressiveness, or parental monitoring. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Three-year longitudinal panel study. A total of 3034 children and adolescents from 6 primary and 6 secondary schools in Singapore (73%male) were surveyed annually. Children were eligible for inclusion if they attended one of the 12 selected schools, 3 of which were boys' schools. At the beginning of the study, participants were in third, fourth, seventh, and eighth grades, with a mean (SD) age of 11.2 (2.1) years (range, 8-17 years). Study participation was 99% in year 1. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The final outcome measurewas aggressive behavior, with aggressive cognitions (normative beliefs about aggression, hostile attribution bias, aggressive fantasizing) and empathy as potential mediators. RESULTS Longitudinal latent growth curve modeling demonstrated that the effects of violent video game play are mediated primarily by aggressive cognitions. This effect is not moderated by sex, prior aggressiveness, or parental monitoring and is only slightly moderated by age, as younger children had a larger increase in initial aggressive cognition related to initial violent game play at the beginning of the study than older children. Model fit was excellent for all models.

,Meta-Analysis Of Digital Game And Study Characteristics Eliciting Physiological Stress Responses,"Digital games have been used as stressors in a range of disciplines for decades. Nonetheless, the underlying characteristics of these stressors and the study in which the stressor was applied are generally not recognized for their moderating effect on the measured physiological stress responses. We have therefore conducted a meta-analysis that analyzes the effects of characteristics of digital game stressors and study design on heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, in studies carried out from 1976 to 2012. In order to assess the differing quality between study designs, a new scale is developed and presented, coined reliability of effect size. The results show specific and consistent moderating functions of both game and study characteristics, on average accounting for around 43%, and in certain cases up to 57% of the variance found in physiological stress responses. Possible cognitive and physiological processes underlying these moderating functions are discussed, and a new model integrating these processes with the moderating functions is presented. These findings indicate that a digital game stressor does not act as a stressor by virtue of being a game, but rather derives its stressor function from its characteristics and the methodology in which it is used. This finding, together with the size of the associated moderations, indicates the need for a standardization of digital game stressors. © 2015 Society for Psychophysiological Research.",doi,10.1111/psyp.12431,Scopus,Psychophysiology,"van der Vijgh B., Beun R.-J., Van Rood M., Werkhoven P.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Metabolic Requirements Of Interactive Video Game Cycling,"Background: Interactive video game exercise leads to improved exercise adherence and health-related physical fitness in comparison to traditional stationary cycling. It has been postulated that interactive video game exercise has greater metabolic requirements than traditional cycling; however, this has not been tested to date. Purpose: To examine the metabolic requirements of interactive video game exercise in comparison to traditional stationary cycling at matched incremental workloads. Methods: Fourteen participants (seven males and seven females) were examined during three separate sessions: 1) incremental cycle ergometer exercise for the assessment of maximal aerobic power and peak workload; 2) traditional cycling on a cycle ergometer using 5-min constant workloads of 25%, 50%, and 75% of maximal power output; and 3) cycling using identical constant, relative workloads while playing interactive video games. Measurements of oxygen consumption, heart rate, and rating of perceived exertion were assessed throughout. Results: During interactive video game exercise, steady-state heart rate (26% ± 18% and 14% ± 13%), energy expenditure (61% ± 41% and 25% ± 21%), and oxygen consumption (34% ± 17% and 18% ± 12%) were significantly higher at the constant submaximal workloads of 25% and 50%, respectively. There was no significant difference in rating of perceived exertion between conditions at any workload. Conclusions: Interactive video game cycling results in greater metabolic requirements (despite similar perceptions of exertion) at submaximal constant workloads than traditional cycling. This form of training may be a novel and an attractive intervention in the battle against physical inactivity and associated health complications. © 2009 The American College of Sports Medicine.",doi,10.1249/MSS.0b013e31819012bd,Scopus,Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise,"Warburton D.E.R., Sarkany D., Johnson M., Rhodes R.E., Whitford W., Esch B.T.A., Scott J.M., Wong S.C., Bredin S.S.D.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Methodology Of Affective Intervention Design For Intelligent Systems,"This paper concerns how intelligent systems should be designed to make adequate, valuable and natural affective interventions. The article proposes a process for choosing an affective intervention model for an intelligent system. The process consists of 10 activities that allow for step-by-step design of an affective feedback loop and takes into account the following factors: expected and desired emotional states, characteristics of the system and available input channels for emotion recognition. The proposed method is supported with three examples of intelligent systems that have used the process to design or to describe affective intervention. Two of them are case studies of affective video games that were designed with the proposed approach and evaluated against the non-affective versions. Another example described in the article is the affective tutoring system Gerda, which exemplifies a more complex and sophisticated intervention model. © 2016 The Author 2016.

,Microcomputer Analysis And Display Of Canine Small Intestinal Electrical Activity,"A system combining analogue filtering and digital counting was used to study the canine intestinal EMG. Recordings were made in conscious dogs from electrodes previously sutured to the serosa of the small intestine at operation under halothane/nitrous oxide anaesthesia. Signals recorded on cassette tape were replayed 60 times faster than the recording speed. After filtering the output was half-wave rectified and passed to Schmitt triggers with variable gain for adjustment of the input voltage. This triggered a monostable multivibrator which produced a 1 ms output pulse. The pulses were taken to three flag switches of the Apple lle Games Controller An Assembler program read the value at the flag locations every millisecond, incremented a temporary store and transferred the contents of the counter into a memory location when an interrupt was received every second by a clock. The data were displayed to show patterns of EMG activity and used for quantification of the results. This system provides a low-cost, flexible method of analysing intestinal EMG which avoids analogue-to-digital conversion. © 1987 IFMBE.",doi,10.1007/BF02447337,Scopus,Medical & Biological Engineering & Computing,"Barnett T.G., Koeze T.H., Pilot M.A., Qin X.Y.",1987,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Mobile Agents For Economic Market Simulation,"This paper reports on the development of an economic market simulator using mobile agents. Agents are specialized software programs that can move autonomously between supporting platforms. Agents can be used to model the preferences of users wishing to buy or sell items on a global marketplace. Users can select a number of options that will guide the agents in their quest for an optimal trade. Besides the price range, users can determine the way in which the agents will bargain, thus fine-tuning the tradeoffs involved in deciding whether a price in the price range requires further negotiation or is acceptable. The simulation developed is realized entirely in Java, and takes advantage of TEEMA, an extensible, general-purpose mobile agent execution environment, dedicated to the purpose of exploring the capabilities of mobile agents. TEEMA has been realized to provide a testbed for agent applications without having to be limited by proprietary application suites or inaccessible low-level interfaces. It is completely configurable and easily extensible as it is built around a microkernel that supports primitive agent operations and a set of services that provide high-level agent support. The paper starts with the description of the infrastructure necessary to define a marketplace as a combination of service agents. Then, trader agents are explained. The simulation environment is then introduced, and analyzed. The architecture emerging from the simulation environment is then examined, together with its advantages and disadvantages. Finally, the simulation parameters are presented. An analysis of the results shows that the simulation environment can provide a suitable platform for economic simulation based on empirical analysis or more formal systems such as game theory.

,Modeling Believable Agents Using A Descriptive Approach,"The concept of believable agents in game and simulator design has become increasingly important. This is because the improved realism offered by synthetic agents can lead to the increased popularity and prolonged life of electronic games. This paper offers a model for the development of believable agents. Specifically, this paper proposes the use of a descriptive approach to agent design. Using this approach, in-game agents are designed to learn human emotional responses from real world data. To achieve this, training data was collected and fed to the descriptive learning believable agent model. Further, we conducted a comparative study to determine whether agents designed using this approach were more believable than agents designed using more traditional approaches. The findings from this study revealed that the descriptive learning agent was perceived by study participants to be more believable than the agent that was programmed according to the specifications of two third-party agent developers. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",doi,10.1016/j.bica.2015.09.004,Scopus,Biologically Inspired Cognitive Architectures,"Harris T., Gittens C.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Modelling Human Emotions For Tactical Decision-Making Games,"The training of tactical decision making increasingly occurs through serious computer games. A challenging aspect of designing such games is the modelling of human emotions. Two studies were performed to investigate the relation between fidelity and human emotion recognition in virtual human characters. Study 1 compared five versions of a virtual character that expressed emotions through different combinations of posture, facial expression, and tone of voice. Results showed that emotion recognition was best when all three behavioural cues were present; posture + face and posture + tone of voice were joint second best. In study 2, these three versions were supplemented with contextual information. Cross-variant comparisons yielded marginal differences in emotion recognition and no differences in tactical decision making. Together, these findings suggest that the combination of posture with either facial expression or tone of voice is sufficient to ensure recognition of human emotions in tactical decision-making games. © 2012 The Authors.

,Modulation Of Attentional Inhibition By Norepinephrine And Cortisol After Psychological Stress,"Two of the most salient physiological responses to stress are increased norepinephrine (NE) and cortisol (CORT) activities. However, it is unclear how these neurochemical events affect cognition, especially attention. We examined the effects of mild psychological stress on selective attention, as assessed by the negative priming (NP) paradigm. Salivary measures of the stress hormone CORT and α-amylase (a correlate of NE) were assayed to probe the relationship between the stress response and attentional inhibition. Healthy subjects (N=20) engaged in the attention task, which was then followed by 15 min of a stressful video game before a return to the attentional task. Baseline saliva samples were obtained before the experiment began, 1 min after the video-game stressor, and 20 min post-stress. Subjects showed a significant reduction in NP and a decrease in reaction time (RT) after the video game. Moreover, α-amylase levels increased significantly after the stressor, indicating the role of NE in the acute stress response. While CORT levels remained unchanged after stress, CORT correlated significantly with both NP scores and RT after the stressor. These results imply that mild psychological stress can significantly alter attentional processes. Given the increase in α-amylase and the correlation between attention and CORT after stress, it seems likely that attentional processes are under tight control by brain systems which mediate the fight-or-flight response.

,Mood Swings: Expressive Speech Animation,"Motion capture-based facial animation has recently gained popularity in many applications, such as movies, video games, and human-computer interface designs. With the use of sophisticated facial motions from a human performer, animated characters are far more lively and convincing. However, editing motion data is difficult, limiting the potential of reusing the motion data for different tasks. To address this problem, statistical techniques have been applied to learn models of the facial motion in order to derive new motions based on the existing data. Most existing research focuses on audio-to-visual mapping and reordering of words, or on photo-realistically matching the synthesized face to the original performer. Little attention has been paid to modifying and controlling facial expression, or to mapping expressive motion onto other 3D characters. This article describes a method for creating expressive facial animation by extracting information from the expression axis of a speech performance. First, a statistical model for factoring the expression and visual speech is learned from video. This model can be used to analyze the facial expression of a new performance or modify the facial expressions of an existing performance. With the addition of this analysis of the facial expression, the facial motion can be more effectively retargeted to another 3D face model. The blendshape retargeting technique is extended to include subsets of morph targets that belong to different facial expression groups. The proportion of each subset included in a final animation is weighted according to the expression information. The resulting animation conveys much more emotion than if only the motion vectors were used for retargeting. Finally, since head motion is very important in adding liveness to facial animation, we introduces an audio-driven synthesis technique for generating new head motion. © 2005 ACM.",doi,10.1145/1061347.1061355,Scopus,ACM Transactions on Graphics,"Chuang E., Bregler C.",2005,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Motivations In Personalisation Behaviour,"A number of emerging technologies including mobile phones and services, on-line shopping and portals, and games and communities are designed to provide users with control over appearance and functioning. Understanding why users personalise could help design personalisation features so that they promote the acceptance and adoption of information and communication technology (ICT). This paper examines the psychological underpinnings of users' willingness to expend effort to personalise ICT. The important role of the basic need of self-determination [Deci, E.L., Ryan, R.M., 2000. The""what"" and ""why"" of goal pursuits: Human needs and the self-determination of behaviour. Psychological Inquiry 11, 227-268] is argued for. Personalisation features can align the psychological resources with the user's action and therefore enhance performance and enjoyment of use. First, they can promote autonomy and the sense of being an origin and therefore transform technology to 'my technology.' Second, personalisation features can support competence by increasing the effectiveness of user's actions. At its best, personalisation becomes rewarding activity in itself regardless of the achieved effects, for example when personalisable features participate in flow experiences. Third, through its appearance functions, technology can support the basic need of relatedness through expression of emotion and identity, ego-involvement, and territory marking. Several positive effects can be identified: engagement, performance, persistence, identity, social acceptance, and social status. The paper concludes by discussing implications to design. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

,Multiagent Cooperation And Competition With Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Evolution of cooperation and competition can appear when multiple adaptive agents share a biological, social, or technological niche. In the present work we study how cooperation and competition emerge between autonomous agents that learn by reinforcement while using only their raw visual input as the state representation. In particular, we extend the Deep Q-Learning framework to multiagent environments to investigate the interaction between two learning agents in the well-known video game Pong. By manipulating the classical rewarding scheme of Pong we show how competitive and collaborative behaviors emerge. We also describe the progression from competitive to collaborative behavior when the incentive to cooperate is increased. Finally we show how learning by playing against another adaptive agent, instead of against a hard-wired algorithm, results in more robust strategies. The present work shows that Deep Q-Networks can become a useful tool for studying decentralized learning of multiagent systems coping with high-dimensional environments. © 2017 Tampuu et al.

,Multimodal Ptsd Characterization Via The Startlemart Game,"Computer games have recently shown promise as a diagnostic and treatment tool for psychiatric rehabilitation. This paper examines the potential of combining multiple modalities for detecting affective responses of patients interacting with a simulation built on game technology, aimed at the treatment of mental diagnoses such as post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). For that purpose, we couple game design and game technology to create a game-based tool for exposure therapy and stress inoculation training that utilizes stress detection for the automatic profiling and potential personalization of PTSD treatments. The PTSD treatment game we designed forces the player to go through various stressful experiences while a stress detection mechanism profiles the severity and type of PTSD by analyzing the physiological responses to those in-game stress elicitors in two separate modalities: skin conductance (SC) and blood volume pulse (BVP). SC is often used to monitor stress as it is connected to the activation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). By including BVP into the model we introduce information about para-sympathetic activation, which offers a more complete view of the psycho-physiological experience of the player; in addition, as BVP is also modulated by SNS, a multimodal model should be more robust to changes in each modality due to particular drugs or day-to-day bodily changes. Overall, the study and analysis of 14 PTSD-diagnosed veteran soldiers presented in this paper reveals correspondence between diagnostic standard measures of PTSD severity and SC and BVP responsiveness and feature combinations thereof. The study also reveals that these features are significantly correlated with subjective evaluations of the stressfulness of experiences, represented as pairwise preferences. More importantly, the results presented here demonstrate that using the modalities of SC and BVP captures a more nuanced representation of player stress responses than using SC alone. We conclude that the results support the use of the simulation as a relevant treatment tool for stress inoculation training, and suggest the feasibility of using such a tool to profile PTSD patients. The use of multiple modalities appears to be key for an accurate profiling, although further research and analysis are required to identify the most relevant physiological features for capturing user stress. © 2014, OpenInterface Association.",doi,10.1007/s12193-014-0160-5,Scopus,Journal on Multimodal User Interfaces,"Holmgård C., Yannakakis G.N., Martínez H.P., Karstoft K.-I., Andersen H.S.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali

,Negotiating Uneven Terrain With A Compliant Designed Unmanned Ground Vehicle Equipped With Locomotive Master-Slave Operation,"In recent years, a number operational unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) have been developed that can negotiate irregular terrain. They have a number of degrees-of-freedom (DOF) giving them enhanced mobility, e.g., the ability to climb stairs and over obstacles. However, operating them remotely is complicated because their controllers are similar to conventional control pads or joysticks used in computer games or toys. It is hard for the operator to achieve an intuitive and natural feel, thus mistakes are common. To intuitively control the locomotion of a UGV with many DOFs, a master-slave operation was implemented. A novel UGV called Kurogane, which consists of a typical crawler combined with a human-like torso section, was developed. The torso section is controlled via a wearable controller interface. In addition, the UGV is equipped with models of muscle viscoelasticity and stretch reflex, called the involuntary autonomous adaptation system, inspired by the adaptive compliance of animals. The proposed system can autonomously and flexibly react and adapt to irregular terrain in real time. Therefore, the operation of Kurogane is simple and does not require great skill or precision. Experimental results show that it performs well over a fixed step, stairs, and rough outdoor terrain. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",doi,10.1002/rob.21449,Scopus,Journal of Field Robotics,"Fukuoka Y., Hoshi K., Kurosawa R.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Neural Correlate Of Human Reciprocity In Social Interactions,"Reciprocity plays a key role maintaining cooperation in society. However, little is known about the neural process that underpins human reciprocity during social interactions. Our neuroimaging study manipulated partner identity (computer, human) and strategy (random, tit-for-tat) in repeated prisoner's dilemma games and investigated the neural correlate of reciprocal interaction with humans. Reciprocal cooperation with humans but exploitation of computers by defection was associated with activation in the left amygdala. Amygdala activation was also positively and negatively correlated with a preference change for human partners following tit-for-tat and random strategies, respectively. The correlated activation represented the intensity of positive feeling toward reciprocal and negative feeling toward non-reciprocal partners, and so reflected reciprocity in social interaction. Reciprocity in social interaction, however, might plausibly be misinterpreted and so we also examined the neural coding of insight into the reciprocity of partners. Those with and without insight revealed differential brain activation across the reward-related circuitry (i.e., the right middle dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and dorsal caudate) and theory of mind (ToM) regions [i.e., ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) and precuneus]. Among differential activations, activation in the precuneus, which accompanied deactivation of the VMPFC, was specific to those without insight into human partners who were engaged in a tit-for-tat strategy. This asymmetric (de)activation might involve specific contributions of ToM regions to the human search for reciprocity. Consequently, the intensity of emotion attached to human reciprocity was represented in the amygdala, whereas insight into the reciprocity of others was reflected in activation across the reward-related and ToM regions. This suggests the critical role of mentalizing, which was not equated with reward expectation during social interactions. © 2013 Sakaiya, Shiraito, Kato, Ide, Okada, Takano and Kansaku.",doi,10.3389/fnins.2013.00239,Scopus,Frontiers in Neuroscience,"Sakaiya S., Shiraito Y., Kato J., Ide H., Okada K., Takano K., Kansaku K.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Neural Correlates Of Wishful Thinking,"Wishful thinking (WT) implies the overestimation of the likelihood of desirable events. It occurs for outcomes of personal interest, but also for events of interest to others we like. We investigated whether WT is grounded on low-level selective attention or on higher level cognitive processes including differential weighting of evidence or response formation. Participants in our MRI study predicted the likelihood that their favorite or least favorite team would win a football game. Consistent with expectations, favorite team trials were characterized by higher winning odds. Our data demonstrated activity in a cluster comprising parts of the left inferior occipital and fusiform gyri to distinguish between favorite and least favorite team trials. More importantly, functional connectivities of this cluster with the human reward system were specifically involved in the type of WT investigated in our study, thus supporting the idea of an attention bias generating WT. Prefrontal cortex activity also distinguished between the two teams.

,Neural Mechanisms Of Social Decision-Making In The Primate Amygdala,"Social decisions require evaluation of costs and benefits to oneself and others. Long associated with emotion and vigilance, the amygdala has recently been implicated in both decision-making and social behavior. The amygdala signals reward and punishment, as well as facial expressions and the gaze of others. Amygdala damage impairs social interactions, and the social neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) influences human social decisions, in part, by altering amygdala function. Here we show inmonkeys playing amodified dictator game, inwhich one individual can donate or withhold rewards from another, that basolateral amygdala (BLA) neurons signaled social preferences both across trials and across days. BLA neurons mirrored the value of rewards delivered to self and others when monkeys were free to choose but not when the computer made choices for them. We also found that focal infusion of OT unilaterally into BLA weakly but significantly increased both the frequency of prosocial decisions and attention to recipients for context-specific prosocial decisions, endorsing the hypothesis that OT regulates social behavior, in part, via amygdala neuromodulation. Our findings demonstrate both neurophysiological and neuroendocrinological connections between primate amygdala and social decisions.",doi,10.1073/pnas.1514761112,Scopus,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,"Chang S.W.C., Fagan N.A., Toda K., Utevsky A.V., Pearson J.M., Platt M.L., Gazzaniga M.S.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Neural Responses To Unfairness And Fairness Depend On Self-Contribution To The Income,"Self-contribution to the income (individual achievement) was an important factor which needs to be taken into individual's fairness considerations. This study aimed at elucidating the modulation of self-contribution to the income, on recipient's responses to unfairness in the Ultimatum Game. Eighteen participants were scanned while they were playing an adapted version of the Ultimatum Game as responders. Before splitting money, the proposer and the participant (responder) played the ball-guessing game. The responder's contribution to the income was manipulated by both the participant's and the proposer's accuracy in the ball-guessing game. It turned out that the participants more often rejected unfair offers and gave lower fairness ratings when they played a more important part in the earnings. At the neural level, anterior insula, anterior cingulate cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and temporoparietal junction showed greater activities to unfairness when self-contribution increased, whereas ventral striatum and medial orbitofrontal gyrus showed higher activations to fair (vs unfair) offers in the other-contributed condition relative to the other two. Besides, the activations of right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during unfair offers showed positive correlation with rejection rates in the self-contributed condition. These findings shed light on the significance of self-contribution in fairness-related social decision-making processes. © The Author (2013).

,Neural Substrates Of Intention–Consequence Integration And Its Impact On Reactive Punishment In Interpersonal Transgression,"When evaluating interpersonal transgressions, people take into account both the consequential damage and the intention of the agent. The intention and consequence, however, do not always match, as is the case with accidents and failed attempts. We combined an interactive game and functional MRI to investigate the neural substrates underlying the processing of intention and consequence, and its bearing on reactive punishment. The participant interacted with anonymous partners, who decided to deliver pain stimulation either to himself/herself or to the participant to earn a monetary reward. In some cases, the decision was reversed by the computer. After pain delivery, the partner’s intention was revealed. Unbeknownst to the partner, the participant was then allowed to punish the partner by reducing his/her monetary reward. Behaviorally, the punishment was lower in the accidental condition (unintended harm relative to intended harm) but higher in the failed-attempt condition (unintended no-harm relative to intended no-harm). Neurally, the left amygdala/hippocampus was activated in the conditions with blameworthy intention (i.e., intentional harm and failed attempt). The accidental (relative to intentional) harm activated the right temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and the anterior inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), while the failed attempt (relative to genuine no-harm) activated the anterior insula (AI) and the posterior IFG. Effective connectivity analysis revealed that in the unintentional conditions (i.e., accidental and failed attempt) the IFG received input from the TPJ and AI, and sent regulatory signals to the amygdala. These findings demonstrate that the processing of intention may gate the emotional responses to transgression and regulate subsequent reactive punishment. © 2015 the authors.",doi,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3536-14.2015,Scopus,Journal of Neuroscience,"Yu H., Li J., Zhou X.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,New Ocular Movement Detector System As A Communication Tool In Ventilator-Assisted Werdnig-Hoffmann Disease,"A non-contact communication system was developed for a ventilator-assisted patient with Werdnig-Hoffmann disease who had lost all voluntary movements except for those of the eye. The system detects the extraocular movements and converts them to either a 'yes' signal (produced by one lateral eyeball movement) or a 'no' signal (produced by two successive lateral eyeball movements) using a video camera placed outside the patient's visual field. The patient is thus able to concentrate on performing a task without any intrusion from the detection system. Once the setting conditions of the device have been selected, there is no need for any resetting, as the patient is unable to move his body. In addition to playing television games, the child can use the device to select television channels, compose music, and learn written Japanese and Chinese characters. This seems to broaden the patient's daily world and promote mental development.",doi,10.1017/S0012162200000116,Scopus,Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology,"Kubota M., Sakakihara Y., Uchiyama Y., Nara A., Nagata T., Nitta H., Ishimoto K., Oka A., Horio K., Yanagisawa M.",2e3,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,No Unified Reward Prediction Error In Local Field Potentials From The Human Nucleus Accumbens: Evidence From Epilepsy Patients,"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), cyclic voltammetry, and single-unit electrophysiology studies suggest that signals measured in the nucleus accumbens (Nacc) during value-based decision making represent reward prediction errors (RPEs), the difference between actual and predicted rewards. Here, we studied the precise temporal and spectral pattern of reward-related signals in the human Nacc. We recorded local field potentials (LFPs) from the Nacc of six epilepsy patients during an economic decision-making task. On each trial, patients decided whether to accept or reject a gamble with equal probabilities of a monetary gain or loss. The behavior of four patients was consistent with choices being guided by value expectations. Expected value signals before outcome onset were observed in three of those patients, at varying latencies and with nonoverlapping spectral patterns. Signals after outcome onset were correlated with RPE regressors in all subjects. However, further analysis revealed that these signals were better explained as outcome valence rather than RPE signals, with gamble gains and losses differing in the power of beta oscillations and in evoked response amplitudes. Taken together, our results do not support the idea that postsynaptic potentials in the Nacc represent a RPE that unifies outcome magnitude and prior value expectation. We discuss the generalizability of our findings to healthy individuals and the relation of our results to measurements of RPE signals obtained from the Nacc with other methods. © 2015 the American Physiological Society.",doi,10.1152/jn.00260.2015,Scopus,Journal of Neurophysiology,"Stenner M.-P., Rutledge R.B., Zaehle T., Schmitt F.C., Kopitzki K., Kowski A.B., Voges J., Heinze H.-J., Dolan R.J.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Novel Integrative Virtual Rehabilitation Reduces Symptomatology Of Primary Progressive Aphasia - A Case Report,"Purpose: BrightBrainer™ integrative cognitive rehabilitation system evaluation in an Adult Day Program by a subject with Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA) assumed to be of the mixed nonfluent/logopenic variant, and for determination of potential benefits. Methods: The subject was a 51-year-old Caucasian male diagnosed with PPA who had attended an Adult Day Program for 18 months prior to BrightBrainer training. The subject interacted with therapeutic games using a controller that measured 3D hand movements and flexion of both index fingers. The computer simulations adapted difficulty level based on task performance; results were stored on a remote server. The clinical trial consisted of 16 sessions, twice/week for 8 weeks. The subject was evaluated through neuropsychological measures, therapy notes and caregiver feedback forms. Results: Neuropsychological testing indicated no depression (BDI 0) and severe dementia (BIMS 1 and MMSE 3). The 6.5 h of therapy consisted of games targeting Language comprehension; Executive functions; Focusing; Short-term memory; and Immediate/working memory. The subject attained the highest difficulty level in all-but-one game, while averaging 1300-arm task-oriented active movement repetitions and 320 index finger flexion movements per session. While neuropsychological testing showed no benefits, the caregiver reported strong improvements in verbal responses, vocabulary use, speaking in complete sentences, following one-step directions and participating in daily activities. This corroborated well with therapy notes. Conclusions: Preliminary findings demonstrate a meaningful reduction of PPA symptoms for the subject, suggesting follow-up imaging studies to detail neuronal changes induced by BrightBrainer system and controlled studies with a sufficiently large number of PPA subjects.

,"Obesity And Cardiovascular Risk Factors In School Children From Sorocaba, Sp.","To verify the prevalence of obesity, systemic arterial hypertension (SAH), waist circumference and acanthosis nigricans (AN) in school children from Sorocaba, in 2009 and associate them with risk factors. A probabilistic sample study was carried out with 680 children (7-11 years) from 13 public schools from the city of Sorocaba, SP. A questionnaire containing questions on physical activity, time spent watching television, playing with video games and computers (TV/VG/PC), student and parental antecedents of arterial hypertension, renal or cardiac disease, and economic level was applied. On physical examination, weight, height, waist circumference (WC) and blood pressure (BP) were measured; presence of AN was observed. The prevalence of nutritional disorders, SAH, WC increase and presence of AN were calculated. To associate body mass index (BMI) > P85 and BP > P90 with the other variables, chi square or Fisher's exact test (significance p < 0.05) and crude and adjusted prevalence odds ratio (POR) were used. The prevalence of BMI > P85 was 22.1% [95% CI: 19.0-25.3%], of BP > P90 10.9% [95% CI: 8.6- 13.5%], increased WC 15.4% [95% CI: 12.9-17.9%] and AN 3.8% [95% CI: 2.6-5.6%]. Paternal antecedents were associated with weight excess in both analysis (POR: 1.76; 95% CI: 1.05-2.95; p = 0.02). High blood pressure was associated with female sex (POR: 1.90; 95% CI: 1.12-3.23; p = 0.01), more time spent with TV/VG/PC (POR: 1.82; 95% CI: 1.00-3.36; p = 0.03), AN (POR: 8.18; 95% CI: 3.37-19.80; p < 0.00), obesity (POR: 4.09; 95% CI: 2.41-6.94; p < 0.00) and WC (POR: 4.83; 95% CI: 2.77-8.41; p < 0.00). After the multivariate analysis, the female sex (adjusted POR = 2.15; 95% CI: 1.17-3.93) and obesity (adjusted POR = 9.51; 95% CI: 4.77-18.97) remained. The prevalence of weight excess, SAH, increased WC and AN in these school children was relevant.

,Online Monitoring Of The Social Presence Effects In A Two-Person-Like Driving Video Game Using Near-Infrared Spectroscopy,"We examined how a friend's presence affects a performer's prefrontal activation in daily-life activities using two wireless portable near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) devices. Participants played a driving video game either solely in the single group or with a friend in the paired group. The two groups (single and paired) were subdivided according to their game proficiency (low and high). The NIRS data demonstrated a significant interaction of group by proficiency. Low-proficiency players in the paired group showed lower activation than those in the single group, but high-proficiency players did not. In the paired group, high-proficiency players showed higher activation than low-proficiency players, but not in the single group. These results suggest that NIRS detects social presence effects in everyday situations: decreasing prefrontal activation in low-proficiency performers due to tension reduction and increasing prefrontal activation in high-proficiency performers due to increased arousal. © 2015 Japanese Psychological Association.",doi,10.1111/jpr.12080,Scopus,Japanese Psychological Research,"Liu T., Saito H., Oi M.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Operationalizing Engagement With Multimedia As User Coherence With Context,"Traditional approaches for assessing user engagement within multimedia environments rely on methods that are removed from the human computer interaction itself, such as surveys, interviews and baselined physiology. We propose a context coherence approach that operationalizes engagement as the amount of independent user variation that covaries in time with multimedia contextual events during unscripted interactions. This can address questions about the features of multimedia users are most engaged and how engaged users are without the need for prescribed interactions or baselining. We assessed the validity of this approach in a psychophysiological study. Forty participants played interactive video games. Intake and post-stimulus questionnaires collected subjective engagement reports that provided convergent and divergent validity criteria to evaluate our approach. Estimates of coherence between physiological variation and in-game contextual events predicted subjective engagement and added information beyond physiological metrics computed from baselines taken outside of the multimedia context. Our coherence metric accounted for task-dependent engagement, independent of predispositions; this was not true of a baselined physiological approach that was used for comparison. Our findings show compelling evidence that a context-sensitive approach to measuring engagement overcomes shortcomings of traditional methods by making best use of contextual information sampled from multimedia in time-series analyses. © 2010-2012 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TAFFC.2015.2512867,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing,"Poore J.C., Webb A.K., Cunha M.G., Mariano L.J., Chappell D.T., Coskren M.R., Schwartz J.L.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Opportunities For Multiagent Systems And Multiagent Reinforcement Learning In Traffic Control,"The increasing demand for mobility in our society poses various challenges to traffic engineering, computer science in general, and artificial intelligence and multiagent systems in particular. As it is often the case, it is not possible to provide additional capacity, so that a more efficient use of the available transportation infrastructure is necessary. This relates closely to multiagent systems as many problems in traffic management and control are inherently distributed. Also, many actors in a transportation system fit very well the concept of autonomous agents: the driver, the pedestrian, the traffic expert; in some cases, also the intersection and the traffic signal controller can be regarded as an autonomous agent. However, the iagentification"" of a transportation system is associated with some challenging issues: the number of agents is high, typically agents are highly adaptive, they react to changes in the environment at individual level but cause an unpredictable collective pattern, and act in a highly coupled environment. Therefore, this domain poses many challenges for standard techniques from multiagent systems such as coordination and learning. This paper has two main objectives: (i) to present problems, methods, approaches and practices in traffic engineering (especially regarding traffic signal control); and (ii) to highlight open problems and challenges so that future research in multiagent systems can address them. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",doi,10.1007/s10458-008-9062-9,Scopus,Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems,Bazzan A.L.C.,2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Overapproximating Reachable Sets By Hamilton-Jacobi Projections,"In earlier work, we showed that the set of states which can reach a target set of a continuous dynamic game is the zero sublevel set of the viscosity solution of a time dependent Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) partial differential equation (PDE). We have developed a numerical tool - based on the level, set methods of Osher and Sethian - for computing these sets, and we can accurately calculate them for a range of continuous and hybrid systems in which control inputs are pitted against disturbance inputs. The cost of our algorithm, like that of all convergent numerical schemes, increases exponentially with the dimension of the state space. In this paper, we devise and implement a method that projects the true reachable set of a high dimensional system into a collection of lower dimensional subspaces where computation is less expensive. We formulate a method to evolve the lower dimensional reachable sets such that they are each an overapproximation of the full reachable set, and thus their intersection will also be an overapproximation of the reachable set. The method uses a lower dimensional HJI PDE for each projection with a set of disturbance inputs augmented with the unmodeled dimensions of that projection's subspace, We illustrate our method on two examples in three dimensions using two dimensional projections, and we discuss issues related to the selection of appropriate projection subspaces.",doi,10.1023/A:1025364227563,Scopus,Journal of Scientific Computing,"Mitchell I.M., Tomlin C.J.",2003,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali

,Personality Differences Between High And Low Electronic Video Game Users.,"In recent months a controversy has emerged in the United States over the possible effects video game usage has on the individual personality. At present no empirical data exist to indicate whether there are any personality differences between high- and low-use video game players. High and low users of video games (N = 280) were compared by sex. No significant differences were found between groups for either sex on the personality dimensions of: 1) self-esteem–self-degradation, 2) social deviancy–social conformity, 3) hostility–kindness, 4) social withdrawal–gregariousness, 5) obsessive–compulsive, and 6) achievement motivation. Correlations between the six personality variables and the weekly amount of time spent playing video games yielded no significant relationships for either sex.

,"Personality, Psychopathology And Developmental Issues In Male Adolescent Video Game Use.","This paper presents an empirical study of the relationship of heavy video game use in adolescent male subjects to personality and psychopathological factors. Based on the nature of the games and on developmental theory, it was hypothesized that heavy video game use plays a role in managing developmental conflicts, particularly with regard to the discharge of aggression and the open expression of competition, and does not result in increased neuroticism, social withdrawal, or escape into fantasy. Heavy video game users were also hypothesized to have lower frustration tolerance. A study of 208 adolescent male subjects supported these hypotheses. The results were discussed in terms of the need for mastery of experiences, and in terms of the reawakening of Oedipal conflicts in adolescence as described by Blos. It was stressed that much of the anxiety about video games represents a parental issue, akin to parental overreactions to other adolescent outlets.",doi,10.1016/S0002-7138(09)61094-3,anderson2010,Journal of the American Academy of Child Psychiatry,"Kestenbaum, G.

,Phase Diagrams For An Evolutionary Prisoner's Dilemma Game On Two-Dimensional Lattices,The effects of payoffs and noise on the maintenance of cooperative behavior are studied in an evolutionary prisoner's dilemma game with players located on the sites of different two-dimensional lattices. This system exhibits a phase transition from a mixed state of cooperators and defectors to a homogeneous one where only the defectors remain alive. Using Monte Carlo simulations and the generalized mean-field approximations we have determined the phase boundaries (critical points) separating the two phases on the plane of the temperature (noise) and temptation to choose defection. In the zero temperature limit the cooperation can be sustained only for those connectivity structures where three-site clique percolation occurs. © 2005 The American Physical Society.,doi,10.1103/PhysRevE.72.047107,Scopus,"Physical Review E - Statistical, Nonlinear, and Soft Matter Physics","Szabó G., Vukov J., Szolnoki A.",2005,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Physical Activities In Adolescent Girls. Variability In Energy Expenditure,"Background: Understanding interindividual variability of energy expended in common activities is important for determining precise estimates of energy expenditure in surveillance studies and clinical trials. The purpose of this study was to describe the variability in energy expenditure for selected physical activities among adolescent girls. Methods: Seventy-four adolescent girls (aged 13 to 14 years) participated in this cross-sectional investigation. Data were collected in 2001 and analyzed in 2004. Energy expenditure was measured by indirect calorimetry for ten activities and during a submaximal cycle ergometer test, which was used to estimate cardiorespiratory fitness. Variability in energy expended for the various activities was expressed by standard deviation, coefficient of variation, and range for three different energy expenditure variables: relative VO2 (milliliters per kilogram per minute), absolute VO2 (liters per minute-1), and calculated metabolic rate (kilojoules per minute). Results: Depending on the expression of energy expenditure, coefficients of variation ranged from a low of 13.2% for climbing stairs to a high of 38.4% for playing a computer game. Some lower-intensity activities were associated with greater variability in energy expenditure. Bicycling showed consistently higher coefficients of variation across expressions of energy expenditure (29.1%, 37.7%, and 33.5% for relative VO2, absolute VO2, and calculated metabolic rate, respectively). Conclusions: Energy expenditure for common activities is highly variable in adolescent girls. The coefficient of variation was higher in some activities of lower intensity, regardless of energy expenditure expression. This variance may influence the evaluation of physical activity interventions, particularly with regard to issues such as a prescribed dose of activity and the statistical power to detect change. © 2006 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.",doi,10.1016/j.amepre.2006.06.002,Scopus,American Journal of Preventive Medicine,"Pfeiffer K.A., Schmitz K.H., McMurray R.G., Treuth M.S., Murray D.M., Pate R.R.",2006,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,"Physical Demands Of Elite Rugby League Referees, Part Two: Heart Rate Responses And Implications For Training And Fitness Testing","The purpose of this study was to assess whether any characteristic patterns of heart rate (HR) responses could be identified in National Rugby League (NRL) referees (n= 6) during matches played in the 2001 season. The data have been plotted and discussed, in order that exercise program planning practitioners may gain improved understandings of the physiological requirements for referees. Some specific training suggestions have also been made. Methods: The HR was recorded every five seconds throughout six competition NRL matches; using a heart rate monitor with a built-in memory. Results: The specific magnitudes of referees' HR mean values varied between individuals, possibly due to specific game intensities, referee fitness, and age. All referees however exhibited similar HR response patterns; characterised by frequent (13-20 per match) large transient upward and downward shifts (&gt;20 beats.minute-1). Periods of elevated HR extended for between five sec and eight min at a time, and were further characterised as a typical cyclic wave of HR elevation and recovery (ranging from 99.2±12.4 beats.minute-1 to 176.5±11.8 beats.minute-1 [mean ±95% CI]), with a work to rest ratio of 2:1. Steady state HR was not achieved at any time during any match. Conclusions: The findings of the present study, taken together with a recent motion analysis, indicate that Rugby League refereeing is a highly intermittent, variable intensity activity. Significant anaerobic contribution to performance appears likely. It is suggested that training and fitness assessment of athletes should reflect their specific demands; some specific recommendations have therefore been provided.",doi,10.1016/S1440-2440(04)80006-9,Scopus,Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport,"Kay B., Gill N.D.",2004,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali

,Physiological And Brain Activity After A Combined Cognitive Behavioral Treatment Plus Video Game Therapy For Emotional Regulation In Bulimia Nervosa: A Case Report,"Background: PlayMancer is a video game designed to increase emotional regulation and reduce general impulsive behaviors, by training to decrease arousal and improve decision-making and planning. We have previously demonstrated the usefulness of PlayMancer in reducing impulsivity and improving emotional regulation in bulimia nervosa (BN) patients. However, whether these improvements are actually translated into brain changes remains unclear. Objective: The aim of this case study was to report on a 28-year-old Spanish woman with BN, and to examine changes in physiological variables and brain activity after a combined treatment of video game therapy (VGT) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Methods: Ten VGT sessions were carried out on a weekly basis. Anxiety, physiological, and impulsivity measurements were recorded. The patient was scanned in a 1.5-T magnetic resonance scanner, prior to and after the 10-week VGT/CBT combined treatment, using two paradigms: (1) an emotional face-matching task, and (2) a multi-source interference task (MSIT). Results: Upon completing the treatment, a decrease in average heart rate was observed. The functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) results indicated a post-treatment reduction in reaction time along with high accuracy. The patient engaged areas typically active in healthy controls, although the cluster extension of the active areas decreased after the combined treatment. Conclusions: These results suggest a global improvement in emotional regulation and impulsivity control after the VGT therapy in BN, demonstrated by both physiological and neural changes. These promising results suggest that a combined treatment of CBT and VGT might lead to functional cerebral changes that ultimately translate into better cognitive and emotional performances. ©Ana Beatriz Fagundo, Esther Via, Isabel Sánchez, Susana Jiménez-Murcia, Laura Forcano, Carles Soriano-Mas, Cristina Giner-Bartolomé, Juan J Santamaría, Maher Ben-Moussa, Dimitri Konstantas, Tony Lam, Mikkel Lucas, Jeppe Nielsen, Peter Lems, Narcís Cardoner, Jose M Menchón, Rafael de la Torre, Fernando Fernandez-Aranda.",doi,10.2196/jmir.3243,Scopus,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"Fagundo A.B., Via E., Sánchez I., Jiménez-Murcia S., Forcano L., Soriano-Mas C., Giner-Bartolomé C., Santamaría J.J., Ben-Moussa M., Konstantas D., Lam T., Lucas M., Nielsen J., Lems P., Cardoner N., Menchón J.M., De La Torre R., Fernandez-Aranda F.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Physiological And Psychophysiological Responses To An Exer-Game Training Protocol,"Objectives: Exer-games and virtual reality offer alternative opportunities to provide neuro-rehabilitation and exercise that are fun. Our goal was to determine how effective they are in achieving motor learning goals and fitness benefits as players gain experience. Design: We employed a repeated measures design to determine changes in physical exertion and engagement with training. Methods: Fourteen healthy adults trained on the XBOX Kinect video game Dance Central using a skill-based protocol to examine changes in energy expenditure (EE), heart rate (HR), METs, limb movement, game proficiency, and player engagement in initial, post-training, and transfer-testing of a full-body dance exer-game. Data were analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance, p < 0.05. Results: Both EE, HR, and METs increased from initial (EE 4.89 ± 1.35, HR 103 ± 18, METs 4.25 ± 0.72) to post-training (EE 5.92 ± 1.25, HR 110 ± 15, METs 5.05 ± 0.75) and were greatest during transfer-testing (EE 6.34 ± 1.35, HR 115 ± 17, METs 5.42 ± 0.88, p ≤ 0.001). Proficiency, measured by game scores, also increased from initial to post-training and transfer-testing (≤ 0.002). Limb movement and player engagement remained unchanged. Conclusions: It is important to understand whether player physiological and psychophysiological responses change with continued game-play. Although Dance Central involves whole-body movement, physical exertion remained at moderate levels after training. As exer-game and virtual reality systems move from their initial novelty, research about how players react to continued involvement with a game can guide game developers to maintain a freshness through game progression that preserves the participant's attentional focus, minimizes attrition and maintains a prescribed level of energy exertion. © 2015 Sports Medicine Australia.",doi,10.1016/j.jsams.2015.03.003,Scopus,Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport,"Bronner S., Pinsker R., Naik R., Noah J.A.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Physiological Arousal Deficits In Addicted Gamers Differ Based On Preferred Game Genre,"Background/Aims: There has been significant discussion surrounding the psychopathology of excessive gaming and whether it constitutes an addiction. The current study investigated physiological and subjective levels of arousal in gamers of two genres and the relationship between sensation seeking and gaming addiction.

Gamers were identified as addicted using the Addiction-Engagement Questionnaire. Sensation seeking was measured using the Arnett Inventory of Sensation Seeking. Results: Addicted MMORPG gamers (n = 16) displayed significant decreases in cardiovascular activity during gaming compared to baseline and showed significant increases after gaming. Addicted FPS gamers (n = 13) had significant increases in BP during gaming which decreased significantly after gaming. In comparison, non-addicted MMORPG gamers (n = 14) had significant decreases in HR during gaming, whereas BP in non-addicted MMORPG and FPS gamers (n = 17) increased during gaming and after gaming. There were no significant relationships between sensation seeking and addiction. Conclusion: There are physiological arousal deficits in addicted gamers, and these patterns differ according to the genre of game played. Copyright © 2013 S.

,Physiological Response During Activity Programs Using Wii-Based Video Games In Patients With Cystic Fibrosis (Cf),"Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) are characterized by an abnormal ventilation response that limits the exercise capacity. Exercise training increases exercise capacity, decreases dyspnea and improves health-related quality of life in CF. Adherence to pulmonary rehabilitation programs is a key factor to guarantee optimal benefits and a difficult goal in this population.The aim of this study was to determine the physiological response during three Nintendo Wii™ video game activities (VGA) candidates to be used as training modalities in patients with CF. Method: 24 CF patients (age 12.6±3.7years; BMI 18.8±2.9kgm-2; FEV1 93.8±18.8%pred) were included.All participants performed, on two separate days, 3 different VGA: 1) Wii Fit Plus (Wii-Fit); 2) Wii Active (Wii-Acti), and 3) Wii Family Trainer (Wii-Train), in random order during 5min. The obtained results were compared with the 6-min walk test (6MWT). The physiological variables [oxygen uptake (VO2), minute ventilation (VE), and heart rate (HR)] were recorded using a portable metabolic analyzer. Results: During all VGA and 6MWT, VO2 reached a plateau from the 3rd min. Compared with the 6MWT (1024.2±282.2mLm-1), Wii-Acti (1232.2±427.2mLm-1) and Wii-Train (1252.6±360.2mLm-1) reached higher VO2 levels during the last 3min (p&lt;0.0001 in both cases), while Wii-Fit (553.8±113.2mLm-1) reached significantly lower levels of VO2 (p&lt;0.001). Similar effects were seen for the ventilatory volume (VE). No differences in dyspnea and oxygen saturation were seen between the different modalities. All patients were compliant with all three Wii™ modalities. Conclusion: Active video game are well tolerated by patients with CF. All the modalities evaluated imposed a constant load but were associated with different physiological responses reflecting the different intensities imposed. Wii-Acti and Wii-Train impose a significantly high metabolic demand comparable to the 6MWT. Further research is needed to evaluate the effects of VGA as a training program to increase exercise capacity for CF patients. © 2014 European Cystic Fibrosis Society.",doi,10.1016/j.jcf.2014.05.004,Scopus,Journal of Cystic Fibrosis,"del Corral T., Percegona J., Seborga M., Rabinovich R.A., Vilaró J.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Physiological Responses To Near-Miss Outcomes And Personal Control During Simulated Gambling,"Near-miss outcomes during gambling are non-win outcomes that fall close to a pay-out. While objectively equivalent to an outright miss, near-misses motivate ongoing play and may therefore be implicated in the development of disordered gambling. Given naturalistic data showing increases in heart rate (HR) and electrodermal activity (EDA) during periods of real gambling play, we sought to explore the phasic impact of win, near-miss and full-miss outcomes on physiological arousal in a controlled laboratory environment. EDA and HR were monitored as healthy, student participants (n = 33) played a simulated slot-machine task involving unpredictable monetary wins. A second gambling distortion, perceived personal control, was manipulated within the same task by allowing the participant to select the play icon on some trials, and having the computer automatically select the play icon on other trials. Near-misses were rated as less pleasant than full-misses. However, on trials that involved personal choice, near-misses produced higher ratings of 'continue to play' than full-misses. Winning outcomes were associated with phasic EDA responses that did not vary with personal choice. Compared to full-misses, near-miss outcomes also elicited an EDA increase, which was greater on personal choice trials. Near-misses were also associated with greater HR acceleration than other outcomes. Near-miss outcomes are capable of eliciting phasic changes in physiological arousal consistent with a state of subjective excitement, despite their objective non-win status. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",doi,10.1007/s10899-011-9247-z,Scopus,Journal of Gambling Studies,"Clark L., Crooks B., Clarke R., Aitken M.R.F., Dunn B.D.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,"Physiological, Psychological, And Behavioral Factors And White Coat Hypertension","Patients with hypertension in the clinic but not during daily activities (""white coat"" hypertension) may be at lower risk of hypertensive morbidity and mortality than patients with hypertension in both settings (""persistent"" hypertension). We hypothesized that the white coat phenomenon was due to greater blood pressure reactivity to the stress of a clinic visit and that, as a consequence, white coat hypertensive patients would display greater blood pressure reactivity to exercise and mental stress, as well as increased emotional reactivity and higher levels of anger, anxiety, or depression. We studied 89 patients with essential hypertension between 29 and 59 years old with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, treadmill exercise testing with oxygen consumption measurement, mental stress testing (including mental arithmetic, public speaking, and video game tasks), and psychological testing (State-Trait Anxiety Scale, Cook-Medley Hostility Scale, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, emotional reactivity scale). We defined white coat hypertension as a mean ambulatory systolic blood pressure of 135 mm Hg or less and diastolic 85 mm Hg or less and persistent hypertension as a mean ambulatory systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or more or diastolic 90 mm Hg or more. Forty-nine patients were classified as persistent hypertensives and 20 as white coat hypertensives. No significant differences were seen in demographic or clinical characteristics, fitness level, blood pressure response to exercise or mental stress, or psychological characteristics, except that white coat hypertensive patients had lower systolic blood pressures in the clinic and during exercise and greater variability of clinic diastolic blood pressures. Thus, we were unable to distinguish white coat from persistent hypertensive patients by these clinical, demographic, emotional, or reactivity measures.",doi,10.1161/01.HYP.16.2.140,Scopus,Hypertension,"Siegel W.C., Blumenthal J.A., Divine G.W.",1990,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,"Play Pattern Of Seated Video Game And Active ""Exergame"" Alternatives","The purpose of the study was to compare the play pattern of "" exergames"" and seated internet-based video games between boys and girls. Seventy-nine participants (40 boys, 39 girls) aged 9 to 12 years (M = 10.85 ± 0.9) were involved in two 1-hour video game sessions. Play pattern in terms of frequency, duration and intensity were assessed from observation, accelerometry and heart rate monitoring. Results indicated that children spent half of the available time playing the activity-promoting exergames (XaviX bowling 47.6 ± 14.9%; XaviX J-Mat 48.8 ± 12.8%). No differences between the boys and girls were apparent for total time played, number of play bouts or duration per bout (p ≥ 0.05). Boys however played both exergames more actively than the girls (XaviX bowling RT3 counts.s-1: boys 10.47 ± 4.71, girls 6.34 ± 2.76; XaviX J-Mat RT3 counts·s-1: boys 66.37 ± 13.84, girls 51.94 ± 17.83). This study concludes that both boys and girls choose to play exergames for similar periods of time, but play style during the XaviX bowling was often inactive in the girls and during the XaviX J-Mat less active in the girls than the boys. Reasons underlying choice of play was similar between the girls and boys. Active video games appear to be suitable for longer-term physical activity interventions in children, but attention will need to be given to the intensity of game play in girls. © 2011 Chinese Taipei Society of Ultrasound in Medicine &amp; Elsevier.",doi,10.1016/S1728-869X(11)60003-8,Scopus,Journal of Exercise Science and Fitness,"Lam J.W.K., Sit C.H.P., McManus A.M.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Player-Game Interaction Through Affective Sound,"This chapter treats computer game playing as an affective activity, largely guided by the audio-visual aesthetics of game content (of which, here, we concentrate on the role of sound) and the pleasure of gameplay. To understand the aesthetic impact of game sound on player experience, definitions of emotions are briefly discussed and framed in the game context. This leads to an introduction of empirical methods for assessing physiological and psychological effects of play, such as the affective impact of sonic playergame interaction. The psychological methodology presented is largely based on subjective interpretation of experience, while psychophysiological methodology is based on measurable bodily changes, such as context-dependent, physiological experience. As a means to illustrate both the potential and the difficulties inherent in such methodology we discuss the results of some experiments that investigate game sound and music effects and, finally, we close with a discussion of possible research directions based on a speculative assessment of the future of player-game interaction through affective sound. © 2011, IGI Global.",doi,10.4018/978-1-61692-828-5.ch013,Scopus,Game Sound Technology and Player Interaction: Concepts and Developments,"Nacke L.E., Grimshaw M.",2010,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Playing A Violent Television Game Affects Heart Rate Variability,"Objective: To investigate how playing a violent/nonviolent television game during the evening affects sympathetic and parasympathetic reactions during and after playing as well as sleep quality during the night after playing. Subjects and Methods: In total, 19 boys, 12-15 years of age, played television games on two occasions in their homes and participated once without gaming. Heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV) and physical activity were measured during gaming/participating and the night to follow using a portable combined heart rate and movement sensor. A sleep diary and questionnaires about gaming experiences and session-specific experiences were filled in. Criteria for Selection of Games: Violent game involves/rewards direct physical violence (no handguns) against another person, and nonviolent game involves/rewards no violence; same game design ('third-person game'); conducted in the same manner; no differences concerning motor activity; similar sound and light effects; no sexual content, violence against women or racial overtones. Results: During violent (vs. nonviolent) gaming, there was significantly higher activity of the very low frequency component of the HRV and total power. During the night after playing, very low frequency, low frequency and high frequency components were significantly higher during the violent (vs. nonviolent) condition, just as total power. There were no significant differences between the three conditions (violent/nonviolent/no gaming) with respect to an index reflecting subjectively perceived sleep difficulties. Nor was there any difference between violent and nonviolent condition for any single sleep item. Conclusion: Violent gaming induces different autonomic responses in boys compared to nonviolent gaming - during playing and during the following night - suggesting different emotional responses. Subjectively perceived sleep quality is not influenced after a single gaming experience. Future studies should address the development of the autonomic balance after gaming over longer time than a night, physiological adaptation to frequent gaming and potential gender differences. © 2008 The Author(s).",doi,10.1111/j.1651-2227.2008.01096.x,Scopus,"Acta Paediatrica, International Journal of Paediatrics","Ivarsson M., Anderson M., Åkerstedt T., Lindblad F.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,"Playing A Violent Television Game Does Not Affect Saliva Cortisol. Acta Paediatrica, 98(6), 1052–3.","The role of playing a violent television game on saliva cortisol was investigated. Twenty-one boys, 12–15 years of age, participated in their homes between 8 and 10 pm on three different weekdays by playing a violent television game, playing a nonviolent game and not playing at all. A logarithm transformation was applied in the statistical computations to normalize the distribution of cortisol data. There were no significant differences in cortisol level between the violent and non-violent game, neither in the development before/after gaming (no significant interaction) nor at waking up the subsequent morning. The mean cortisol levels actually decreased across the games thereby not deviating from the normal circadian pattern. Also the overall pattern of cortisol showed the expected circadian shape with morning levels similar to those of boys of the same age in a Swedish normative sample. It was suggested that cortisol levels might usually not increase as a reaction to playing television games unless other stressors, like intense sound effects, were involved.

,"Pleasure To Play, Arousal To Stay: The Effect Of Player Emotions On Digital Game Preferences And Playing Time","This study investigated how player emotions during game-play, measured through self-report and physiological recordings, predict playing time and game preferences. We distinguished between short-term (immediately after game-play) and long-term (after 3 weeks) playing time and game preferences. While pleasure was most predictive for short-term playing time and game preferences, arousal, particularly for game preferences, was most predictive on the longer term. This result was found through both self-report and physiological emotion measures. This study initiates theorizing about digital gaming as a hedonic consumer product and sketches future research endeavors of this topic. © 2012 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",doi,10.1089/cyber.2010.0040,Scopus,"Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking","Poels K., Hoogen W.V.D., Ijsselsteijn W., De Kort Y.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,"Predicting Adolescent Problematic Online Game Use From Teacher Autonomy Support, Basic Psychological Needs Satisfaction, And School Engagement: A 2-Year Longitudinal Study","Problematic online game use (POGU) has become a serious global public health concern among adolescents. However, its influencing factors and mediating mechanisms remain largely unknown. This study provides the first longitudinal design to test stage-environment fit theory empirically in POGU. A total of 356 Chinese students reported on teacher autonomy support, basic psychological needs satisfaction, school engagement, and POGU in the autumn of their 7th-9th grade years. Path analyses supported the proposed pathway: 7th grade teacher autonomy support increased 8th grade basic psychological needs satisfaction, which in turn increased 9th grade school engagement, which ultimately decreased 9th grade POGU. Furthermore, 7th grade teacher autonomy support directly increased 9th grade school engagement, which in turn decreased 9th grade POGU. These findings suggest that teacher autonomy support is an important protective predictor of adolescent POGU, and basic psychological needs satisfaction and school engagement are the primary mediators in this association. © 2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",doi,10.1089/cyber.2014.0385,Scopus,"Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking","Yu C., Li X., Zhang W.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Predicting Dual-Task Performance With The Multiple Resources Questionnaire (Mrq),"Objective: The objective was to assess the validity of the Multiple Resources Questionnaire (MRQ) in predicting dual-task interference. Background: Subjective workload measures such as the Subjective Workload Assessment Technique (SWAT) and NASA Task Load Index are sensitive to single-task parameters and dual-task loads but have not attempted to measure workload in particular mental processes. An alternative is the MRQ. Method: In Experiment 1, participants completed simple laboratory tasks and the MRQ after each. Interference between tasks was then correlated to three different task similarity metrics: profile similarity, based on r2 between ratings; overlap similarity, based on summed minima; and overall demand, based on summed ratings. Experiment 2 used similar methods but more complex computer-based games. Results: In Experiment 1 the MRQ moderately predicted interference (r = +.37), with no significant difference between metrics. In Experiment 2 the metric effect was significant, with overlap similarity excelling in predicting interference (r = +.83). Mean ratings showed high diagnosticity in identifying specific mental processing bottlenecks. Conclusion: The MRQ shows considerable promise as a cognitive-process-sensitive workload measure. Application: Potential applications of the MRQ include the identification of dual-processing bottlenecks as well as process overloads in single tasks, preparatory to redesign in areas such as air traffic management, advanced flight displays, and medical imaging.

,Prediction Of Resting Cardiovascular Functioning In Youth With Family Histories Of Essential Hypertension: A 5-Year Follow-Up.,"Two hundred forty-six children (96 Whites, of whom 51 were males; 150 African- Americans, of whom 69 were males) with a familial history of essential hypertension (EH) were re-evaluated 5 years after an initial evaluation. During the initial visit anthropometric, demographic, and resting cardiovascular (CV) parameters (designated initial baseline levels) were assessed. These CV parameters (systolic and diastolic blood pressure [BP], heart rate, cardiac output index [CI], and total peripheral resistance index [TPRI] were also measured during postural challenge, a video game challenge, and a cold pressor task. At follow-up, resting CV parameters were again evaluated, and designated as follow-up resting levels. Moderate temporal stability (r range = .43-.56) was observed for all resting CV parameters. Mean stress responses for each CV parameter for all 3 stressors during the initial visit were positively related to the respective CV follow-up resting level. BP stress responses to postural change and video game challenge to be significant independent predictors of future resting BP after controlling for standard EH risk factors. Follow-up resting CI was not predicted by any stress responses, whereas follow-up resting TPRI was predicted by TPRI responses to the video game after controlling for standard Eh risk factors. These results contrast with those from an earlier 1-year follow-up, where stress responses for neither CI nor TPRI predicted follow-up resting levels. It appears that, as children get older, TPRI stress responses play a stronger role in vasoconstrictive function.",doi,10.1207/s15327558ijbm0404_2,pubmed,International journal of behavioral medicine,"Treiber, F A; Turner, J R; Davis, H; Strong, W B",2006,NA,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Predictors And Health Consequences Of Screen-Time Change During Adolescence - 1993 Pelotas (Brazil) Birth Cohort Study,"Purpose: To investigate screen-time change from early to mid adolescence, its predictors, and its influence on body fat, blood pressure, and leisure-time physical activity. Methods: We used data from a longitudinal prospective study, conducted among participants of the 1993 Pelotas (Brazil) Birth Cohort Study. At baseline, adolescents were, on average, 11 years old. They were later visited at age 15 years. Screen time was self-reported, accounting for the time spent watching television, playing video games, and using the computer. Several predictors were examined. The effect of screen-time change on some health outcomes was also analyzed. Results: Screen time increased on average 60 min/d from 11 to 15 years of age, for the 4,218 adolescents studied. The groups that presented the highest increases in screen time were male, wealthiest, those whose mothers had higher education, and adolescents with a history of school failure. There were positive associations between screen-time change and body mass index, skinfold thickness, waist circumference, and leisure-time physical activity at 15 years of age. Conclusions: Screen time increased from early to mid adolescence. This increment was higher among boys and the wealthiest adolescents. Increases in screen time affected body composition, with negative implications on adiposity. © 2012 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

,Preferences For Individual Video Games As A Function Of Their Emotional Effects On Players,"Video games vary in terms of the emotional states they elicit from players. These differences in emotional reactions, in turn, help account for differential preferences of individual games. The three independent dimensions of pleasure‐displeasure, arousal‐nonarousal, and dominance‐submissiveness were used to assess emotional impacts of individual games. In addition, a preference measure was constructed to evaluate attraction toward, versus avoidance of, specific games. In Study One, a group of subjects provided data on emotional responses to 22 common arcade video games and a different group rated their preferences for the same games. The emotional impact of video games was highly unpleasant, moderately arousing, and moderately dominance‐inducing; thus, the predominant emotional response to these games was aggression, anger, or hostility. I n Study Two, subjects visiting a video game arcade were recruited and assigned to play two games each and to report their reactions to each game immediately after playing the game. Results showed that greater feelings of pleasure, and separately of arousal, while playing video games resulted in higher preferences for the games and that greater dominance (significant only for males) also led to higher preferences. It may be beneficial, therefore, to experiment with more arousing and more dominance‐inducing game designs which are not necessarily unpleasant or which definitely yield high pleasure.

,"Pressor Reactivity, Ethnicity, And 24-Hour Ambulatory Monitoring In Children From Hypertensive Families","We assessed blood pressure responses of a multiethnic (Black and White) sample of 120 children of hypertensive families to orthostasis, video game, forehead cold, and dynamic exercise, and monitored the children’s ambulatory pressure 24 hours later. Thirteen children were studied twice (1-year stability). The Black children exhibited higher 24-hour ambulatory systolic and diastolic pressures than the White children. Regardless of ethnicity, peak and mean systolic pressures during each task were generally positively correlated with mean systolic pressure while the children were awake and asleep. Associations between diastolic pressor responses and ambulatory measurements were somewhat dependent upon ethnicity and task. Relatively few reactivity-ambulatory correlations were significant, using pressor reactivity change scores. The children who participated twice exhibited significant 1-year stability for most ambulatory and pressor measurements. Children’s pressor responses to laboratory tasks may generalize to the natural environment. © 1994 College health All right reserved.",doi,10.1080/08964289.1994.9934628,Scopus,Behavioral Medicine,"Treiber F.A., Murphy J.K., Davis H., Austin Raunikar R., Pflieger K., Strong W.B.",1994,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Prevalence Of Risk For Type 2 Diabetes In School Children,"According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1 in 3 children born in 2000 in the United States will become diabetic. The odds are higher for African American and Hispanic children as nearly 50% of them will develop diabetes. Random screening is not effective in identifying children at risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM); therefore, there is a need to apply screening strategies that guide the development of appropriate primary prevention efforts. To assess the prevalence of risk factors for T2DM, 1066 fifth-grade children were screened using American Diabetes Association guidelines. Overall, 22.6% were found at risk; African American and Hispanic children were almost 8 times more likely to be at risk when compared to Caucasians (odds ratio = 7.41 and 7.87). Children who reported watching TV/playing video games 2 or more hours/day were 73% more likely to be at risk. Children identified to be at risk were referred to their primary care provider and were invited to participate in a counseling session. The environmental risk factors for T2DM identified in this study are modifiable and should be targeted in preventive interventions at the school and community level to reduce overweight and consequently prevent T2DM in children, especially among minority children. © 2006, American School Health Association.",doi,10.1111/j.1746-1561.2006.00093.x,Scopus,Journal of School Health,"Urrutia-Rojas X., Menchaca J.",2006,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Propulsion Technique And Anaerobic Work Capacity In Elite Wheelchair Athletes: Cross-Sectional Analysis,"Wheelchair sports and daily manual wheelchair propulsion are dominated by frequent short-term power demands. The purpose of the current cross- sectional study was to determine the variation in propulsion technique in association with sprint power production among elite wheelchair athletes. Therefore, 67 wheelchair athletes (different impairment; 17 female and 50 male athletes; age, 29.1 ± 7 yr; body weight, 60.7 ± 11.8 kg; training hours, 12.9 ± 6.4 h · wk-1; VO2 (peak) 1.7 ± 0.7 liter · min-1; aerobic power output, 72.2 ± 36.7 W) were studied during the World Championships and Games for the Disabled in Assen (1990) on propulsion technique and anaerobic work capacity in a 30-s sprint test on a computer controlled wheelchair ergometer. Mean power output (P30) (97 ± 45.8 w; range, 8.3-195.3 W) and heart rate (158.6 ± 23.6 b · min-1) were highly variable and seemed associated with impairment level: track athletes, classified in four different functional classes, showed a class-related P30 of 23, 68, 100, and 138 W for the male athletes (n = 38). Sprint power relative to body weight varied between 0.36 W · kg BW-1 ± 0.04 and 1.85 W · kg BW-1 ± 0.43 for the different subject groups. Propulsion technique in terms of forces applied to the rim and timing showed significant differences between subject groups for the majority of parameters studied. Apart from the mediolateral force and the negative dip at the start of the push phase, the technique parameters were significantly related to power production. Fraction effective force, the ratio between the total force vector and the effective force applied to the hand rim, appeared low on average (especially for subjects with cerebral palsy and those with a high spinal lesion) but showed a significant correlation with power output (r = 0.5). In general, propulsion technique parameters were related to both performance and functionality. The number of training hours showed a small but significant relation with peak power (r = 0.31), peak torque (r = 0.4), the amount of work per push (r = 0.41) and total force vector (r = 0.31), stressing the role of training status, next to disability, as important mediating factor in both propulsion technique as well as performance capacity. No association between training hours and fraction effective force was seen. It can be concluded that propulsion technique and performance parameters are highly variable among wheelchair athletes. Also, propulsion technique is strongly associated with functionality and training hours and does clearly relate to performance. The current results on technique and performance and their possible causal relationship, but also with impairment and sports discipline, must be further substantiated in a longitudinal study design.The variation in propulsion technique in association with sprint power production among elite wheelchair athletes was examined. Sixty-seven athletes were studied during the World Championships and Games for the Disabled in Assen on propulsion technique and anaerobic work capacity in a 30-s sprint test on a computer controlled wheelchair ergometer. It is shown that propulsion technique parameters are related to both performance and functionality. This suggests that propulsion technique and performance parameters are highly variable among wheelchair athletes.

,Prosocial Behavior Increases Well-Being And Vitality Even Without Contact With The Beneficiary: Causal And Behavioral Evidence,"A number of studies have shown that prosocial behavior is associated with enhanced well-being, but most prior experimental studies have involved actual or potential face-to-face contact with the beneficiary. To establish that it is prosocial behavior itself, and not only an increased sense of social relatedness to the recipient that improves well-being, participants (n = 76) were invited to play a simple computer game, where half were made aware of a chance to have an anonymous prosocial impact through gameplay. As compared to the control condition, this group experienced more positive affect, meaningfulness and marginally more vitality. Going beyond self-reported outcomes, they also demonstrated better post-game performance on a subsequent Stroop task, providing behavioral evidence for the positive effects of prosocial behavior. Also supported was the hypothesis that these positive effects of prosocial behavior on well-being were mediated by subjectively assessed autonomy and competence need satisfactions. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",doi,10.1007/s11031-016-9552-z,Scopus,Motivation and Emotion,"Martela F., Ryan R.M.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Psychophysiological Responses In Women Reporting Severe Premenstrual Symptoms,"Sixteen women attending a Premenstrual Tension Clinic and eight control women were tested experimentally in the premenstrual and postmenstrual phases with assessments of heart rate, skin conductance level, and neck electromyogram during rest, relaxation, an emotionally upsetting film, and performance of mental arithmetic and video game tasks. All participants completed daily symptom assessments for two menstrual cycles prior to the study. The clinic attenders were divided into eight (Clinic+) who showed marked increases in symptoms premenstrually, and eight (Clinic-) who recorded only modest changes in symptom severity across the menstrual cycle. There were no marked differences in resting autonomic activity. During relaxation, skin conductance level decreased to a greater extent in the premenstrual than in the postmenstrual phase, while neck electromyogram showed the reverse pattern. Heart rate reactions to the mental arithmetic and video game tasks were smaller in the premenstrual than in the postmenstrual phase in Controls and Clinic- groups, but not in the Clinic+ group. Possible explanations of these results are discussed.",doi,10.1097/00006842-198905000-00006,Scopus,Psychosomatic Medicine,"Van den Akker O., Steptoe A.",1989,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali

A novel technique that combines Q(λ)-learning with function approximation (fuzzy inference system) is proposed. The system learns autonomously without supervision or a priori training data. The proposed technique is applied to three different pursuit-evasion differential games. The proposed technique is compared with the classical control strategy, Q(λ)-learning only, and the technique proposed by Dai et al. (2005) in which a neural network is used as a function approximation for Q-learning. Computer simulations show the usefulness of the proposed technique.

Our focus is on autonomous multimedia users. We propose a novel resource management scheme, where resource brokers choose well-suited axiomatic bargaining solutions to divide their allocated resources among the users associated with them. These resource division solutions enable resource brokers to provide strict minimum video quality guarantees according to the (varying) number of multimedia users associated with them. Finally, we show that the proposed solution enables us to model the problem of selecting resource brokers by multimedia users as an unweighted congestion game, thereby ensuring convergence to a stationary distribution of users across resource brokers. We investigate the number of required users' switches to reach the stationary distribution, and quantify the fairness of the stationary distribution by introducing a novel quality fairness comparison metric for the users. © 2009 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TCSVT.2009.2026983,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology,"Park H., Van Der Schaar M.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,"Quantification Of Physiological, Movement, And Technical Outputs During A Novel Small-Sided Game In Young Team Sport Athletes","The aim of this study was to quantify the physiological responses, timemotion characteristics, and technical executions associated with a novel non-sportspecific small-sided game (SSG) in young team sport players. On 6 separate occasions, 12 young male team sport athletes (mean 6 SD: age, 13.0 6 0.3 years; height, 157.4 6 4.9 cm; body mass, 47.0 6 5.0 kg; and V-O2peak, 55.1 6 4.6 ml$kg21$min21) completed various ""bucketball"" SSG formats (i.e., 3 vs. 3, 4 vs. 4, and 6 vs. 6) twice each. Heart rate (HR) was measured during each SSG at 5-second intervals. Time-motion characteristics were measured using global positioning systems. Ratings of perceived exertion (RPEs) were recorded immediately after the SSGs using the Borg scale (RPEs, 620). Technical skill executions were measured using a high-speed digital video camera. Analysis revealed a tendency for the 3 vs. 3 games to elicit higher HRs (88.3 6 4.3) than either 4 vs. 4 (85.9 6 4.9) or 6 vs. 6 formats (85.9 6 3.2). Total distance traveled at 1317.9 km$h21 was more during 6 vs. 6 than 3 vs. 3 games (very likely substantial true difference, 97%), and total possessions and number of catches, passes, and shots were all higher in 3 vs. 3 compared with 4 vs. 4 and 6 vs. 6 games. There was no difference in RPE between the game formats. The results of this study indicate that 3 vs. 3 non-sportspecific SSGs provide higher stimulus for aerobic fitness adaptation and technical improvement than1 4 vs. 4 and 6 vs. 6 formats, and their use for training young team sport athletes is recommended. © 2013 National Strength and Conditioning Association.",doi,10.1519/JSC.0b013e318280c98d,Scopus,Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research,"Harrison C.B., Gill N.D., Kinugasa T., Kilding A.E.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Quantum Decision-Maker,"A quantum device simulating human decision making process is introduced. It consists of quantum recurrent nets generating stochastic processes which represent the motor dynamics, and of classical neural nets describing evolution of probabilities of these processes which represent the mental dynamics. The autonomy of the decision making process is achieved by a feedback from mental to motor dynamics which changes the stochastic matrix based upon the probability distributions. This feedback replaces an unavailable external information by an internal knowledgebase stored in the mental model in the form of probability distributions. As a result, the coupled motor-mental dynamics is described by a nonlinear version of Markov chains which can decrease entropy without an external source of information. Applications to common sense based decisions as well as to evolutionary games are discussed.",doi,10.1016/S0020-0255(00)00053-0,Scopus,Information sciences,Zak M.,2e3,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Rapid Habituation Of Ventral Striatal Response To Reward Receipt In Postpartum Depression,"Background: Little is known about neural mechanisms of postpartum depression (PPD). Previous research notes ventral striatal activity and dopamine release increases with maternal attachment but decreases in major depressive disorder. This study tests the hypothesis that striatal response to reward is altered in PPD. Methods: Subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging blood oxygenation level-dependent acquisition during a fast event-related card-guessing, monetary reward task. Time series data from an independent sample of 10 healthy mothers were used to establish the ventral striatal region of interest (ROI). Repeated-measures analysis of variance of time series data in the established ROI was then conducted for a discrete group of healthy (n = 12) and depressed, unmedicated mothers (n = 12). Results: Data from the independent sample of 10 healthy mothers established an ROI in the left ventral striatum (-13, 12, -4, 477 mm 3), with cluster significance p &lt;.01, corrected. There was a significant quadratic interaction of time × group [F(1,22) = 5.22, p =.032] in this ROI in the healthy (n = 12) and depressed mothers (n = 12). This effect represents a nonlinear attenuation of ventral striatal response with time that was greater in depressed than healthy mothers. Conclusions: Rapid attenuation of ventral striatal response to reward receipt in postpartum depression might represent an important neural mechanism of postpartum depression. Additional study with infant stimuli and in relationship to motherinfant behavior is needed. © 2011 Society of Biological Psychiatry.",doi,10.1016/j.biopsych.2011.02.021,Scopus,Biological Psychiatry,"Moses-Kolko E.L., Fraser D., Wisner K.L., James J.A., Saul A.T., Fiez J.A., Phillips M.L.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Rating Electronic Games: Violence Is In The Eye Of The Beholder.,"Commercial ratings assist parents in monitoring their children's media experiences. Exposure to media violence may affect attitudes and behavior, and rating systems should accurately reflect the presence of violent content. Validity indicators for commercial rating systems are examined, including consistency with consumer perceptions. Violent electronic games are a contemporary media phenomenon. A comparison of commercial ratings for popular electronic games with consumer perceptions of game content indicates that, for games with obviously nonviolent or very violent content, there is agreement between consumers and the commercial system. However, there is considerable disagreement about notable violent content in games with cartoon-type violence. Recommendations include incorporating consumer perceptions into a comprehensive, content-based, informational rating system for all entertainment media.",doi,10.1177/0044118X99030003002,anderson2010,Youth & Society,"Funk, J.

,Recognizing Jump Patterns With Physics-Based Validation In Human Moving Trajectory,"This paper presents an approach to recognize jump patterns in human moving trajectory, differentiating jump tracks from planar moving tracks. Since human moving trajectory is one of the most informative representations for content understanding and event detection, trajectory-based video analysis has been gaining popularity. However, a jump action typically leads to violent change in human moving trajectory, since the person suddenly leaves the original plane on which he/she has been moving. The abnormal tracks of the trajectory would influence the performance of trajectory-based video analysis. Hence, differentiating jump tracks from planar moving tracks is of vital importance, not to mention that jump actions typically imply significant events, especially in sports games. In this paper, volleyball videos are used as case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed jump pattern recognition approach. We derive player trajectory by head tracking, analyze the movement of each player, and recognize potential jump tracks in player trajectories based on two important characteristics: (1) jumps cause pulse-like tracks in the trajectory and (2) the extensions of such tracks go through the vanishing point of vertical lines in the scenes. Finally, the jump positions/heights are estimated, in addition to the planar moving trajectory of each player on the court ground. The experiments show that satisfactory results can be obtained with the proposed recognition scheme. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

,Relation Of Psychosocial And Stress Reactivity Variables To Ventricular Arrhythmias In The Cardiac Arrhythmia Pilot Study (Caps),"Both animal and human data implicate psychosocial distress and cardiovascular reactivity in response to challenge in the etiology of sudden cardiac death. In this study, the relation of these bio-behaviorial factors to frequency of ventricular premature complexes, a predictor of sudden death was investigated. The study population was made up of patients enrolled in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Cardiac Arrhythmia Pilot Study (CAPS). Ventricular premature complexes (VPCs) were assessed by multiple, 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic recordings. Patients completed trait psychosocial measures assessed at baseline and state psychosocial measures assessed periodically during a 1-year follow-up period. Psychosocial measures included self-reports of depression, anxiety, anger and type A behavior pattern. A competitive challenge using a video game was used as a stressor to elicit cardiovascular reactivity and was administered at baseline and during follow-up sessions. Cardiovascular reactivity was defined as peak level during stressor exposure minus the mean of resting levels for systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate. Results indicated that biobehavioral factors were not associated with diurnal VPC rates. Furthermore, biobehavioral factors did not predict response to antiarrhythmic therapy. Based upon the results of this study, it is speculated that the established relation between behavioral factors and sudden death may not be mediated by VPC rates. © 1990.",doi,10.1016/0002-9149(90)90737-L,Scopus,The American Journal of Cardiology,"Follick M.J., Ahern D.K., Gorkin L., Niaura R.S., Herd J.A., Ewart C., Schron E.B., Kornfeld D.S., Capone R.J., The CAPS Investigators",1990,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Relationship Of Body Composition To Stress-Induced Pressure Natriuresis In Youth,"The contribution of stress to obesity-related cardiovascular disease is uncertain. The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of body composition on stress-induced pressure natriuresis. Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry was performed in 127 African American and white youths to assess lean body mass (LBM), fat mass (FM), and total percentage of body fat (%BF). The stress protocol was comprised of a 2-h baseline period, 1-h video game competition stressor, and 2-h recovery period. Blood and urine samples were collected hourly and blood pressure (BP) was obtained at 15-min intervals. Both BP and urinary sodium excretion(U NaV) increased from baseline to stress and returned to prestress levels after stress (P =. 001 for each). The BP levels and changes were positively correlated with LBM. In contrast, levels and changes in sodium excretion U NaV were inversely correlated with FM and %BM. Multiple regression analyses that included ethnicity, sex, angiotensin II (Ang II), and measures of body composition in the models indicated the following: a) LBM was the best predictor of stress systolic BP and independently contributed with ethnicity to stress diastolic BP; b) ethnicity was the only independent predictor of the stress-related change in systolic and diastolic BP; c) LBM was the only independent predictor of the change in BP from stress to recovery for both systolic and diastolic BP; and d) total percent body fat accounted for 11.2% of the variance of stress U NaV, with Ang II contributing an additional 6.1%. Based on the results of this study, ethnicity and body composition are related to stress-induced pressure natriuresis. © 2004 American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.amjhyper.2004.05.007,Scopus,American Journal of Hypertension,"Wilson M.E., Harshfield G.A., Ortiz L., Hanevold C., Kapuka G., MacKey L., Gillis D., Edmonds L., Evans C.",2004,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Requirements For And Impact Of A Serious Game For Neuro-Pediatric Robot-Assisted Gait Training,"We investigated whether children with neurological gait disorders who walked in a driven gait orthosis could adjust their participation level according to the demands of a newly developed rehabilitation game. We further investigated if cognitive capacity and motor impairment influenced game performance. Nineteen children with neurological gait disorders (mean age: 13.4y, 42% girls) participated. To quantify game participation, electromyographic muscle activity (M. rectus femoris) and heart rate were compared in a demanding part and a less demanding part of the game. Cognitive capacity was assessed with the Test of Nonverbal Intelligence (TONI-4). Furthermore, the Functional Independence Measure for Children (WeeFIM), Manual Muscle Tests and a therapist-derived score of how well the child was able to train were assessed. Results showed that muscle activity and heart rate were higher during the demanding part of the game (30.7. ±. 22.6. μV; 129.4. ±. 15.7. bpm) compared to the less demanding part (16.0. ±. 13.4. μV; 124.1. ±. 15.9. bpm; p<. 0.01 for both measures). Game performance correlated moderately with the TONI-4 (r= 0.50, p = 0.04) and the cognition subscale of the WeeFIM (ρ= 0.59, p= 0.01). The therapist-derived score correlated significantly with game performance (p= 0.75, p<. 0.01) and the ability to modify muscle activity to the demands of the game (p= -0.72, p<. 0.01). Receiver operating characteristic analyses revealed that the latter factor differentiated well between those children suitable for the game and those not. We conclude that children with neurological gait disorders are able to modify their activity to the demands of the VR-scenario. However, cognitive function and motor impairment determine to which extent. These results are important for clinical decision-making. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.ridd.2013.07.031,Scopus,Research in Developmental Disabilities,"Labruyère R., Gerber C.N., Birrer-Brütsch K., Meyer-Heim A., van Hedel H.J.A.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Responses To Conflict And Cooperation In Adolescents With Anxiety And Mood Disorders,"This study examined patterns of behavioral and emotional responses to conflict and cooperation in adolescents with anxiety/mood disorders and healthy peers. We compared performance on and emotional responses to the Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) game, an economic exchange task involving conflict and cooperation, between adolescents with anxiety/depressive disorders (A/D) (N=21) and healthy comparisons (n = 29). Participants were deceived to believe their co-player (a pre-programmed computer algorithm) was another study participant. A/D adolescents differed significantly from comparisons in patterns of play and emotional response to the game. Specifically, A/D participants responded more cooperatively to cooperative overtures from their co-players; A/D girls also reported more anger toward co-players than did comparison girls. Our findings indicate that A/D adolescents, particularly females, respond distinctively to stressful social interchanges. These findings offer a first step toward elucidating the mechanisms underlying social impairment in youth with internalizing disorders. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",doi,10.1007/s10802-007-9113-8,Scopus,Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology,"McClure E.B., Parrish J.M., Nelson E.E., Easter J., Thorne J.F., Rilling J.K., Ernst M., Pine D.S.",2007,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Reward Anticipation In The Adolescent And Aging Brain,"Processing of reward is the basis of adaptive behavior of the human being. Neural correlates of reward processing seem to be influenced by developmental changes from adolescence to late adulthood. The aim of this study is to uncover these neural correlates during a slot machine gambling task across the lifespan. Therefore, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate 102 volunteers in three different age groups: 34 adolescents, 34 younger adults, and 34 older adults. We focused on the core reward areas ventral striatum (VS) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), the valence processing associated areas, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and insula, as well as information integration associated areas, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and inferior parietal lobule (IPL). Results showed that VS and VMPFC were characterized by a hyperactivation in adolescents compared with younger adults. Furthermore, the ACC and insula were characterized by a U-shape pattern (hypoactivation in younger adults compared with adolescents and older adults), whereas the DLPFC and IPL were characterized by a J-shaped form (hyperactivation in older adults compared with younger groups). Furthermore, a functional connectivity analysis revealed an elevated negative functional coupling between the inhibition-related area rIFG and VS in younger adults compared with adolescents. Results indicate that lifespan-related changes during reward anticipation are characterized by different trajectories in different reward network modules and support the hypothesis of an imbalance in maturation of striatal and prefrontal cortex in adolescents. Furthermore, these results suggest compensatory age-specific effects in fronto-parietal regions. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",doi,10.1002/hbm.22540,Scopus,Human Brain Mapping,"Lorenz R.C., Gleich T., Beck A., Pöhland L., Raufelder D., Sommer W., Rapp M.A., Kühn S., Gallinat J.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Role-Playing Video Games And Emotion: How Transportation Into The Narrative Mediates The Relationship Between Immoral Actions And Feelings Of Guilt,"Several studies have shown that exposure to media violence can lead to strong emotional reactions. This may be particularly true for video game violence and anger. Yet, few studies have explored the relationship between video game play and more complex emotions, such as guilt and shame. Further, prior research has not explored how exposure to the narratively rich violence found in role-playing video games may cause feelings of guilt. The research experiment presented here (n 184) aims to fill this gap in the literature by explaining how the immoral actions of a video game character impact the player's feelings of guilt. Specifically, results show that playing as a video game character that has committed immoral actions caused players to feel guilty and ashamed, especially if they felt transported or ""wrapped-up"" in the narrative. Exposure to immoral actions also caused players to show increases in aggressive behavioral tendencies. © 2015 American Psychological Association.",doi,10.1037/ppm0000084,Scopus,Psychology of Popular Media Culture,"Mahood C., Hanus M.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,"Salivary Alpha Amylase And Cortisol Responses To Different Stress Tasks : Impact Of Sex. International Journal Of Psychophysiology, 69, 33–40.","Neuro-endocrine markers such as salivary alpha amylase (sAA) and cortisol (CORT) play an important role in establishing human responses to stressful events. Whereas sAA levels reflect sympathetic system activity, salivary cortisol appears to be a valid measure for HPA axis activity. Although many studies looked at either sAA or CORT responses in reaction to stress, work still has to be done to look at the way these systems interact, especially when both systems are activated. Additionally, sex effects in CORT responses have been investigated relatively often, but possible sex differences in sAA levels and responses, or the way both systems interact has not been the focus of sufficient studies to yield a univocal conclusion. In this study we presented a group of healthy participants (n=80) with two mildly stressful tasks, consisting of an aversive picture rating task and a cold pressor stress (CPS) task. The second task was compared with a control task. We expected a rise in sAA level in response to the first task and sAA as well as CORT responses on the second task and explored the interaction between the two responses. Results indicate that sAA is indeed a sensitive marker in both psychologically and physically induced arousal paradigms, whereas a cortisol response was only observed in the CPS task. Men had higher sAA levels than women during the complete course of the study, but men and women were comparable in their responsivity to the tasks. No strong correlations between sAA and CORT responses were found.",doi,10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2008.02.008,nagy2015,International Journal of Psychophysiology,"Van Stegeren, A. H., Wolf, O.

,Screen Violence And Youth Behavior,"Violence in screen entertainment media (ie, television, film, video games, and the Internet), defined as depictions of characters (or players) trying to physically harm other characters (or players), is ubiquitous. The Workgroup on Media Violence and Violent Video Games reviewed numerous meta-analyses and other relevant research from the past 60 years, with an emphasis on violent video game research. Consistent with every major science organization review, the Workgroup found compelling evidence of short-term harmful effects, as well as evidence of long-term harmful effects. The vast majority of laboratory-based experimental studies have revealed that violent media exposure causes increased aggressive thoughts, angry feelings, physiologic arousal, hostile appraisals, aggressive behavior, and desensitization to violence and decreases prosocial behavior (eg, helping others) and empathy. Still, to more fully understand the potential for long-term harm from media violence exposure, the field is greatly in need of additional large-sample, high-quality, longitudinal studies that include validated measures of media violence exposure and measures of other known violence risk factors. Also, although several high-quality media violence intervention studies have been conducted, larger-scale studies with more comprehensive and longer-term assessments are needed to fully understand long-term effects and to inform the development of tools that will help to reduce problems associated with aggression and violence. The evidence that violent screen media constitutes a causal risk factor for increased aggression is compelling. Modern social-cognitive theories of social behavior provide useful frameworks for understanding how and why these effects occur.

,Seeing Without Looking: The Effects Of Hemispheric Functioning On Memory For Brands In Computer Games,"The authors hypothesize that the effectiveness of in-game advertising is influenced by two inborn traits, bisected hemispheric functioning and physiological arousal, that are at the core of human behavior. A 2 (preattentive processing type) × 2 (arousal level) between-subjects design was employed in both Experiment 1 (well-known brand placement) and Experiment 2 (lesser-known brand placement). The results from the two experiments reveal that people show better recognition memory for in-game ads when brand names are presented peripherally in the right visual field and brand images are embedded peripherally in the left visual field. In addition, people can remember more brand ads when they experience less arousal (Experiment 1). This effect, however, is attenuated when unfamiliar brands are placed in the game (Experiment 2). Implications are discussed for further investigation. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",doi,10.1080/00913367.2013.774587,Scopus,Journal of Advertising,"Yoon G., Vargas P.T.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali

,Self-Efficacy As A Component Of Active Coping: Effects On Cardiovascular Reactivity,"Active coping remains a poorly understood construct in cardiovascular reactivity testing. We have shown that active coping comprises two independent effects: the enhanced control and the effort of exercising control. The present study tested the proposition that, with effort left unconstrained, increased self-efficacy will increase cardiovascular response. Forty women were assigned to low or high self-efficacy conditions; self-efficacy was manipulated using false feedback. Subjects then engaged in a video game shape-matching task, while blood pressure and heart rate were monitored. SBP and DBP changes were smaller in the low self-efficacy group, as predicted: 17.9 versus 25.2 mmHG for SBP (p<0.05); and 8.7 versus 13.0 mmHG for DBP (p = 0.07). Heart rate was similar for the two conditions. We conclude that self-efficacy for a task may be an integral part of the active coping process, indirectly affecting the blood pressure response by acting on the effort involved in the coping response.",doi,10.1016/0022-3999(95)00642-7,Scopus,Journal of Psychosomatic Research,"Gerin W., Litt M.D., Deich J., Pickering T.G.",1996,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Self-Learning Fuzzy Logic Controllers For Pursuitevasion Differential Games,"This paper addresses the problem of tuning the input and the output parameters of a fuzzy logic controller. The system learns autonomously without supervision or a priori training data. Two novel techniques are proposed. The first technique combines Q(λ)-learning with function approximation (fuzzy inference system) to tune the parameters of a fuzzy logic controller operating in continuous state and action spaces. The second technique combines Q(λ)-learning with genetic algorithms to tune the parameters of a fuzzy logic controller in the discrete state and action spaces. The proposed techniques are applied to different pursuitevasion differential games. The proposed techniques are compared with the classical control strategy, Q(λ)-learning only, reward-based genetic algorithms learning, and with the technique proposed by Dai et al. (2005) [19] in which a neural network is used as a function approximation for Q-learning. Computer simulations show the usefulness of the proposed techniques. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

,Self-Regulation Of Slow Cortical Potentials In Psychiatric Patients: Depression,"Findings on depressive patients indicate that depressives have electrophysiological characteristics similar to those of schizophrenics, in that they exhibit reduced Contingent Negative Variation (CNV) amplitudes and more distinct Postimperative Negative Variations (PINVs) than normal controls. In a biofeedback experiment, 8 medicated male inpatients with the DSM III-R diagnosis of ""Bipolar Disorder, Depressive,"" and ""Major Depression"" demonstrated no impairment in the self-regulation of Slow Cortical Potentials (SCP) in comparison to schizophrenics in terms of increasing and suppressing negativity. Continuous visual SCP feedback is presented to the patient as a horizontally moving rocket in a video game format. The direction changes of the rocket represented SCP changes at each point in time, recorded by the central EEG (based on the pretrial baseline). Depressives demonstrated SCP self-regulation across 20 sessions, although with many between-and-within variations. The 8 male controls were unable to regulate their SCPs across 5 sessions. This result contradicts other findings of our laboratory on normal controls. Motivational factors and insufficient operant reinforcement (financial reward) may have facilitated this effect. © 1992 Plenum Publishing Corporation.",doi,10.1007/BF01000403,Scopus,Biofeedback and Self-Regulation,"Schneider F., Heimann H., Mattes R., Lutzenberger W., Birbaumer N.",1992,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Self-Reported Screen Time And Cardiometabolic Risk In Obese Dutch Adolescents,"Background: It is not clear whether the association between sedentary time and cardiometabolic risk exists among obese adolescents. We examined the association between screen time (TV and computer time) and cardiometabolic risk in obese Dutch adolescents. Methods and Findings: For the current cross-sectional study, baseline data of 125 Dutch overweight and obese adolescents (12-18 years) participating in the Go4it study were included. Self-reported screen time (Activity Questionnaire for Adolescents and Adults) and clustered and individual cardiometabolic risk (i.e. body composition, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, low-density (LDL-C), high-density (HDL-C) and total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides, glucose and insulin) were assessed in all participants. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to assess the association between screen time and cardiometabolic risk, adjusting for age, gender, pubertal stage, ethnicity and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. We found no significant relationship between self-reported total screen time and clustered cardiometabolic risk or individual risk factors in overweight and obese adolescents. Unexpectedly, self-reported computer time, but not TV time, was slightly but significantly inversely associated with TC (B = -0.002; CI = [-0.003;-0.000]) and LDL-C (B = -0.002; CI = [-0.001;0.000]). Conclusions: In obese adolescents we could not confirm the hypothesised positive association between screen time and cardiometabolic risk. Future studies should consider computer use as a separate class of screen behaviour, thereby also discriminating between active video gaming and other computer activities. © 2012 Altenburg et al.",doi,10.1371/journal.pone.0053333,Scopus,PLoS ONE,"Altenburg T.M., Hofsteenge G.H., Weijs P.J.M., Delemarre-van de Waal H.A., Chinapaw M.J.M.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Sensitivity Analysis Of Surface Ozone To Emission Controls In Beijing And Its Neighboring Area During The 2008 Olympic Games,"The regional air quality modeling system RAMS (Regional Atmospheric Modeling System)-CMAQ (Community Multi-scale Air Quality modeling system) is applied to analyze temporal and spatial variations in surface ozone concentration over Beijing and its surrounding region from July to October 2008. Comparison of simulated and observed meteorological elements and concentration of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and ozone at one urban site and three rural sites during Olympic Games show that model can generally reproduce the main observed feature of wind, temperature and ozone, but NOx concentration is overestimated. Although ozone concentration decreased during Olympics, high ozone episodes occurred on 24 July and 24 August with concentration of 360 and 245 μg/m 3 at Aoyuncun site, respectively. The analysis of sensitive test, with and without emission controls, shows that emission controls could reduce ozone concentration in the afternoon when ozone concentration was highest but increase it at night and in the morning. The evolution of the weather system during the ozone episodes (24 July and 24 August) indicates that hot and dry air and a stable weak pressure field intensified the production of ozone and allowed it to accumulate. Process analysis at the urban site and rural site shows that under favorable weather condition on 24 August, horizontal transport was the main contributor of the rural place and the pollution from the higher layer would be transported to the surface layer. On 24 July, as the wind velocity was smaller, the impact of transport on the rural place was not obvious. © 2012 The Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.",doi,10.1016/S1001-0742(11)60728-6,Scopus,Journal of Environmental Sciences,"Gao Y., Zhang M.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Serious Games For Teaching Conflict Resolution: Modeling Conflict Dynamics,"Serious games have already found use in several non-leisure contexts including simulation, training, health and education. In this study we present a serious game designed for the purpose of enhancing the ability of children between the ages of 9 and 12 to cope with conflict situations. Inspired by theoretical models of human conflict and experiential learning, we designed a game through which players experience and try to resolve conflict situations themselves in a virtual environment. In our multiplayer game, Village Voices, each child plays the role of a villager and is asked to complete a number of conflict quests that require social interaction and resource management; the game allows anything from very aggressive behaviours (stealing resources and spreading negative rumors) to collaborative play (trading resources). To model conflict intensity in Village Voices and evaluate its ability to elicit strong emotions and conflict, we ran a game user survey in Portugal from 32 children. Data collected include demographic information and conflict profile types, as well as in-game behavioural data and self-reported notions of conflict and affect during play. The analysis presented in this paper shows that there appear to be strong effects between gender, age, conflict resolution strategy type, cultural tendency, reported emotions and perception about the other players, and reported conflict intensity. Indeed, Village Voices serves as an excellent vehicle for teaching conflict resolution as it is able to elicit bounded conflict situations of varying intensities, and, importantly, enables us to further understand conflict dynamics amongst students of this age group and beyond. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",doi,10.1007/978-3-319-14081-0_21,Scopus,Conflict and Multimodal Communication: Social Research and Machine Intelligence,"Cheong Y.-G., Khaled R., HolmgȦrd C., Yannakakis G.N.",2015,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Sexist Attitudes Among Emerging Adult Women Readers Of Fifty Shades Fiction,"Stereotypical sexist representations of men and women in popular culture reinforce rigid views of masculinity (e.g., males as being strong, in control, masterful, and aggressive) and femininity (e.g., women as being fragile and weak, unassertive, peaceful, irrational, and driven by emotions). The present study examined associations between the fictional series Fifty Shades—one popular culture mechanism that includes pervasive traditional gender role representations—and underlying sexist beliefs among a sample of 715 women ages 18–24 years. Analyses revealed associations between Fifty Shades readership and sexism, as measured through the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory. Namely women who reported reading Fifty Shades had higher levels of ambivalent, benevolent, and hostile sexism. Further, those who interpreted Fifty Shades as “romantic” had higher levels of ambivalent and benevolent sexism. Our findings support prior empirical studies noting associations between interacting with aspects of popular culture, such as television and video games, and individual beliefs and behaviors. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",doi,10.1007/s10508-016-0724-4,Scopus,Archives of Sexual Behavior,"Altenburger L.E., Carotta C.L., Bonomi A.E., Snyder A.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Short-Term And Long-Term Effects Of Violent Media On Aggression In Children And Adults,"Objectives: To test whether the results of the accumulated studies on media violence and aggressive behavior are consistent with the theories that have evolved to explain the effects. We tested for the existence of both short-term and long-term effects for aggressive behavior. We also tested the theory-driven hypothesis that short-term effects should be greater for adults and long-term effects should be greater for children. Design: Meta-analysis. Participants: Children younger than 18 years and adults. Main Exposures: Violent media, including TV, movies, video games, music, and comic books. Main Outcome Measures: Measures of aggressive behavior, aggressive thoughts, angry feelings, physiological arousal (eg, heart rate, blood pressure), and helping behavior. Results: Effect size estimates were combined using meta-analytic procedures. As expected, the short-term effects of violent media were greater for adults than for children whereas the long-term effects were greater for children than for adults. The results also showed that there were overall modest but significant effect sizes for exposure to media violence on aggressive behaviors, aggressive thoughts, angry feelings, arousal levels, and helping behavior. Conclusions: The results are consistent with the theory that short-term effects are mostly due to the priming of existing well-encoded scripts, schemas, or beliefs, which adults have had more time to encode. In contrast, long-term effects require the learning (encoding) of scripts, schemas, or beliefs. Children can encode new scripts, schemas, and beliefs via observational learning with less interference and effort than adults. ©2006 American Medical Association.

,Short Term Exposure To A Violent Video Game Induces Changes In Frontolimbic Circuitry In Adolescents,"Despite evidence of effects of violent video game play on behavior, the underlying neuronal mechanisms involved in these effects remain poorly understood. We report a functional MRI (fMRI) study during two modified Stroop tasks performed immediately after playing a violent or nonviolent video game. Compared with the violent video game group, the nonviolent video game group demonstrated more activation in some regions of the prefrontal cortex during the Counting Stroop task. In contrast to the violent video game group, significantly stronger functional connectivity between left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was identified in the nonviolent video game group. During an Emotional Stroop task, the violent video game group showed more activity in the right amygdala and less activation in regions of the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC). Furthermore, functional connectivity analysis revealed the negative coupling between right amygdala and MPFC in the nonviolent video game group. By contrast, no significant functional connectivity between right amygdala and MPFC was found in the violent video game group. These results suggest differential engagement of neural circuitry in response to short term exposure to a violent video game as compared to a nonviolent video game. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2008.",doi,10.1007/s11682-008-9058-8,Scopus,Brain Imaging and Behavior,"Wang Y., Mathews V.P., Kalnin A.J., Mosier K.M., Dunn D.W., Saykin A.J., Kronenberger W.G.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Simulating Terrorism And Insurgency: Video Games In The War Of Ideas,"This article analyses several video games created by Hezbollah and Afkar Media which simulate recent conflicts in Israel and Lebanon. These games are representative of an important new means of waging ideological warfare which is increasingly a part of the media strategies that states, violent non-state actors and media corporations employ in their efforts to persuade audiences. I argue that video games allow their developers to address players as though they were participants in ongoing conflicts, rather than passive observers, and that this style of presentation is extremely useful to efforts to create an attractive image of people who are frequently described as ‘terrorists’. Video games also enable their developers to carefully construct media narratives that appear to be realistic depictions of contemporary conflicts even when those narratives show signs of bias. Through these mechanisms, video games provide violent non-state actors and organizations sympathetic to them with a means of presenting their grievances and displaying their fighting prowess in ways that advance the organizations' strategic goals. © 2014, Centre of International Studies.",doi,10.1080/09557571.2014.960508,Scopus,Cambridge Review of International Affairs,Schulzke M.,2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Simulation And Computational Intelligence In Real-World Applications,"Many real-world applications of computational intelligence (CI) start with a good training simulator. Enhancing the simulator to use many human senses and to facilitate collection and analysis of data may produce an intelligent virtual reality (VR) system. Careful design of a VR system may encourage the use of “hooks” to allow collection of data, conversion to meaningful informatian, and incorporation of intelligence into later versions and into the final, real-world product. This paper will illustrate these concepts by discussing the challenges of autonomous flight, from simulation to implementation. Fuzzy risk analysis is suggested as a performance evaluation tool for design of CI systems, here defined as systems incorporating artificial neural networks (NN), fuzzy systems, (FZ) evolutionary systems (EC) and/or virtual reality (VR). Intelligent virtual simulation is a tool of the future which promises to move from an intriguing pastime for gamers to a rigorously applied scientific discipline offering economic advantages and service to those working in applications ranging from training simulators to accessibility aids for the handicapped.

,Simulation Study On Opinion Formation Models Of Heterogeneous Agents Based On Game Theory And Complex Networks,"This study investigates a new opinion formation model of heterogeneous agents, a network stubborn individuals and orators (NSO) model based on game theory and complex social networks. Game theory solves economists' rational choice-making problems, and complex social networks reflect the social impact on opinion evolution. The NSO model involves both social and individual heterogeneous characteristics. In a society, the more unequal the members, and the closer the social distances, the faster opinions spread. In the real world, the power-law degree distribution and the short paths in social networks can generate the rapid spread of an opinion. This study also investigates opinion control under the NSO model. The results show that opinion guidance is most likely to separate the public into different groups rather than converge to the guide's opinion. © 2017 Author(s).",doi,10.1177/0037549717709349,Scopus,Simulation,"Li Y., Cao H., Wen G.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Situated Action Approach To Implementing Characters In Computer Games,"Computer games are moving in the direction of more dramatic content. Characters in computer games are becoming more autonomous and are increasingly required to display purposeful and emotional behavior and to appear to understand the situation. An alternative to simulating their mental state is to portray it just as a human actor portrays a character. Situated action provides a theoretical basis for understanding how to do this with quite simple agents. In this article we describe a way of organizing systems of interacting agents and a corresponding agent architecture and implementation technology, all based on situated action, and then report our experience of applying this technology to the production of an agentbased game embedded in a published CD-i title. © 1996 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",doi,10.1080/088395196118687,Scopus,Applied Artificial Intelligence,Wavish P.,1996,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Sleep Quality Is Negatively Related To Video Gaming Volume In Adults,"Most literature on the relationship between video gaming and sleep disturbances has looked at children and adolescents. There is little research on such a relationship in adult samples. The aim of the current study was to investigate the association of video game volume with sleep quality in adults via face-to-face interviews using standardized questionnaires. Adults (n = 844, 56.2% women), aged 18-94 years old, participated in the study. Sleep quality was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and gaming volume was assessed by asking the hours of gaming on a regular weekday (Mon-Thurs), Friday and weekend day (Sat-Sun). Adjusting for gender, age, educational level, exercise and perceived stress, results of hierarchical regression analyses indicated that video gaming volume was a significant predictor of sleep quality (β = 0.145), fatigue (β = 0.109), insomnia (β = 0.120), bedtime (β = 0.100) and rise time (β = 0.168). Each additional hour of video gaming per day delayed bedtime by 6.9 min (95% confidence interval 2.0-11.9 min) and rise time by 13.8 min (95% confidence interval 7.8-19.7 min). Attributable risk for having poor sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index > 5) due to gaming >1 h day was 30%. When examining the components of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index using multinomial regression analysis (odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals), gaming volume significantly predicted sleep latency, sleep efficiency and use of sleep medication. In general, findings support the conclusion that gaming volume is negatively related to the overall sleep quality of adults, which might be due to underlying mechanisms of screen exposure and arousal. © 2014 European Sleep Research Society.",doi,10.1111/jsr.12255,Scopus,Journal of Sleep Research,"Exelmans L., Van den Bulck J.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Social Characters For Computer Games,"Many current video games feature virtual worlds inhabited by autonomous 3D animated characters. These characters often fall short in their ability to participate in social interactions with each other or with people. Increasing the social capabilities of game characters could increase the potential of games as a platform for social learning. This article presents advances in the area of social autonomous character design. Specifically, a computational model of social relationship formation is described. This model formed the basis for a game entitled “AlphaWolf” that allows people to play the role of newborn pups in a pack of virtual wolves, helping the pups to find their place in the social order of the pack. This article offers the results from a 32-subject user study that assessed the social relationship model, showing that it effectively represents the core elements of social relationships in a way that is perceivable by people. Additionally, this article proposes a game that will allow parents, teachers and children to experiment with computational social behavior through social virtual characters. This research contributes to the development of games for social learning by offering a set of viable algorithms for computational characters to form social relationships, and describing a project that could utilize this model to enable children to learn social skills by interacting with game characters. © 2005, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",doi,10.1108/17415650580000036,Scopus,Interactive Technology and Smart Education,Tomlinson B.,2005,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Social Competence Interview For Assessing Physiological Reactivity In Adolescents,"Difficulties in predicting 'real life' physiological variation from responses to controlled stress tasks suggest the need for more ecologically valid laboratory challenges. The Social Competence Interview (SCI) measures physiological changes elicited by re-experiencing a life situation in which a valued striving was unexpectedly hindered. The 14-minute interview yields data on subjects' goals, skills, problem-solving strategies, and social resources. We compared the SCI to video game (VG), mirror drawing (MD), and mental arithmetic (MA) in a racially balanced sample of 260 adolescents (age 14 to 15 years). Blood pressure changes during SCI exceeded those during the other tasks, and were unaffected by race or gender. Blood pressure responses to SCI correlated with responses to MA and MD but appeared to capture a unique domain of social reactivity. Test-retest correlations over 6 months in a random subsample of 27 subjects showed that blood pressure reactivity to SCI and other tasks was reproducible. Intrasubject analyses of responses to the different tasks disclosed subgroups of consistently high and consistently low responders who may be at higher or lower risk. The SCI is not threatening and was rated by subjects as less frustrating or demanding than MD or MA. Its demonstrated effectiveness when administered by several different interviewers suggests the SCI is a promising technique for large scale studies of younger populations.",doi,10.1097/00006842-199105000-00003,Scopus,Psychosomatic Medicine,"Ewart C.K., Kolodner K.B.",1991,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali

,"Social Exclusion In Middle Childhood: Rejection Events, Slow-Wave Neural Activity, And Ostracism Distress","This study examined neural activity with event-related potentials (ERPs) in middle childhood during a computer-simulated ball-toss game, Cyberball. After experiencing fair play initially, children were ultimately excluded by the other players. We focused specifically on ""not my turn"" events within fair play and rejection events within social exclusion. Dense-array ERPs revealed that rejection events are perceived rapidly. Condition differences (""not my turn"" vs. rejection) were evident in a posterior ERP peaking at 420 ms consistent, with a larger P3 effect for rejection events indicating that in middle childhood rejection events are differentiated in <500 ms. Condition differences were evident for slow-wave activity (500-900 ms) in the medial frontal cortical region and the posterior occipital-parietal region, with rejection events more negative frontally and more positive posteriorly. Distress from the rejection experience was associated with a more negative frontal slow wave and a larger late positive slow wave, but only for rejection events. Source modeling with Geosouce software suggested that slow-wave neural activity in cortical regions previously identified in functional imaging studies of ostracism, including sub-genual cortex, ventral anterior cingulate cortex, and insula, was greater for rejection events vs. ""not my turn"" events. © 2010 Psychology Press.",doi,10.1080/17470919.2010.500169,Scopus,Social Neuroscience,"Crowley M.J., Wu J., Molfese P.J., Mayes L.C.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Social Network Modulation Of Reward-Related Signals,"Everyday goals and experiences are often shared with others who may hold different places within our social networks. We investigated whether the experience of sharing a reward differs with respect to social network. Twenty human participants played a card guessing game for shared monetary outcomes with three partners: a computer, a confederate (out of network), and a friend (in network). Participants subjectively rated the experience of sharing a reward more positively with their friends than the other partners. Neuroimaging results support participants' subjective reports, as ventral striatal BOLD responses were more robust when sharing monetary gains with a friend as compared to the confederate or computer, suggesting a higher value for sharing with an in-network partner. Interestingly, ratings of social closeness covaried with this activity, resulting in a significant partner × closeness interaction; exploratory analysis showed that only participants reporting higher levels of closeness demonstrated partner-related differences in striatal BOLD response. These results suggest that reward valuation in social contexts is sensitive to distinctions of social network, such that sharing positive experiences with in-network others may carry higher value. © 2012 the authors.",doi,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0610-12.2012,Scopus,Journal of Neuroscience,"Fareri D.S., Niznikiewicz M.A., Lee V.K., Delgado M.R.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Social Skills Development For Children With Autism Spectrum Disorders Through The Use Of Interactive Storytelling Games,"Storytelling is an intricate part of the human psyche and hence, human history. From childhood, stories play an important role in human development, in that, for instance, humans automatically construct a storyline so that they can associate information. There is research to suggest that storytelling in video games can be beneficial because it can be used to help players identify with characters and their goals, creating a greater sense of immersion, positive feelings, and more physiological arousal. Furthermore, when the content is specific and targeted, these games are well suited for promoting acquisition, maintenance, and generalization of skills and knowledge. Findings such as these hold immense promise in the context of improving social skills for children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Thus, the use of computers and video games, combined with more traditional storytelling, may serve as hopeful tools for motivating and engaging students as well as promoting learning. This chapter expounds upon this line of reasoning and explores the use of interactive storytelling games as an effective intervention in social skills development for children with ASD. © 2014, IGI Global.

,Speaking To The Dead: Images Of The Dead In Contemporary Art,"In this article I explore works by three artists in which we can see images that relate to bereavement. In the work of the first two, Araya Rasdjarmrearnsook and Andres Serrano, we can see photographic images (still and moving) of human corpses, which have been criticized as morbid and unhealthy. However I argue that it is not in fact images of death or the dead that are problematic but those images which present or evoke evidence of the emotions associated with death, and create a situation where we imagine the circumstances of our own deaths or the death of those we love. Images of the dead are acceptable as long as they do not cause pain to the living, as in a video game fantasy or a fiction, or are seen as other and distant. In the second group of works, by Gustgav Metzger, The Absent Dead: The Surrogate Body, the body is not present either because the death has taken place at a distance, either in time or geographically, or both, and a new site must be created. In this section, I discuss Metzger's auto-destructive art and argue that these works, through their ephemerality, embody a form of 'meaning making' and a possibility of the benefits of grief as described by Parkes. © The Author(s) 2011.",doi,10.1177/1363459310397978,Scopus,Health,O'Neill M.,2011,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Stability Of Cooperative Management Of The Pacific Sardine Fishery Under Climate Variability,"Asymmetry in transboundary fish stock distribution caused by climate variability can make the stability of cooperative management challenging. Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax), which exhibits extreme decadal variability in abundance and geographic distribution corresponding to water temperature regime shifts within the California Current Ecosystem, is expected to face such issues. Pacific sardine is a transboundary resource targeted by Mexican, U.S. and Canadian fisheries. Our study applies a three-agent game theoretic model that incorporates environmental effects on Pacific sardine abundance and biomass distribution. Simulations are conducted to evaluate the stability of full and partial cooperative management of the Pacific sardine fishery, under seven different climate variability scenarios. Our results show that ocean climate variability could motivate the formation of stable cooperative management outcomes for the Pacific sardine fisheries operated by Canada, the U.S. and Mexico. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.marpol.2012.12.008,Scopus,Marine Policy,"Ishimura G., Herrick S., Sumaila U.R.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Strategic Formation Of Heterogeneous Networks,"We establish a network formation game for the Internet's autonomous system (AS) interconnection topology. The game includes different types of players, accounting for the heterogeneity of ASs in the Internet. In this game, the utility of a player depends on the network structure, e.g., the distances between nodes and the cost of links. Our model is versatile and can accommodate various configurations: whether monetary transfers are allowed, whether survivability requirements are imposed or not, and if so, whether failures are frequent or rare. We analyze static properties of the game as well as its dynamic evolution. We provide a dynamic analysis of topological quantities, and explain the prevalence of some 'network motifs' in the Internet connectivity graph. We assess our predictions with real-world data. © 1983-2012 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/JSAC.2017.2672339,Scopus,IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications,"Meirom E.A., Mannor S., Orda A.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Survey On Motion Sickness-Like Symptoms Provoked By Viewing A Video Movie During Junior High School Class,"The incident of visually induced motion sickness (VIMS) occurred with a 20-min video movie during class in a local junior high school in Japan in 2003. To investigate possibly contributing factors of VIMS, we collected the incident data in three ways: interviewing school officials, measuring the visual environment on site, and surveying by questionnaires to the students. Analyzing the collected data showed that the students' severities of the sickness related with their viewing distance to the video image, their concentrations on the video movie, their getting a cold, and their daily playing hours of video games. The results indicated that individual differences are determined not only by one factor, like autonomic nervous activity often focused in the literature, but also by combinations of other personal factors, such as health conditions, watching attitudes, and daily play activities. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

,Susceptibility To Induced Visual Discomfort During The Menstrual Cycle While Viewing A Visual Display Unit,"Purpose. Consistent variations in reports of visual discomfort during the female menstrual cycle are found when virtual reality headsets are used to display moving images. Because little is known about the influence of this cycle on susceptibility to visual discomfort in other situations, we performed a laboratory study using an intensive visual task. Methods. Twelve female participants, with normal-length menstrual cycles, completed the study. This required them to play a computer game for 30 minutes while viewing the screen through -2.00-D lenses. Questionnaires were used to record symptom changes; visual acuity and near points of accommodation (NPA) and convergence (NPC) were also recorded both before and after the game. The participants performed this task on designated days (5, 12, 19, and 26) of their menstrual cycle chosen because they fall in line with peaks and troughs of ovarian hormone levels. Cycle phase was confirmed by the measurement of salivary estradiol and progesterone levels. Results. The task performed produced clear changes in all metrics examined. Visual discomfort first increased, on average, after 6 minutes; VA declined on average by 0.02 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution and NPC and NPA both receded by just over 1 cm. However, none of these changes differed significantly at any stage of the menstrual cycle. Conclusions. We conclude that visual discomfort, generated by providing increased accommodative demand while viewing a visual display unit, does not vary significantly during the menstrual cycle.

,Sustained Efficacy Of Virtual Reality Distraction,"The current study tested whether the effectiveness of distraction using virtual reality (VR) technology in reducing cold pressor pain would maintain over the course of 8 weekly exposures. Twenty-eight adults, 18 to 23 years of age, underwent 1 baseline cold pressor trial and 1 VR distraction trial in randomized order each week. VR distraction led to significant increases in pain threshold and pain tolerance and significant decreases in pain intensity, time spent thinking about pain, and self-reported anxiety, relative to baseline. Repeated exposure did not appear to affect the benefits of VR. Implications for the long-term use of VR distraction as a nonpharmacological analgesic are discussed. Perspective: This article addresses the concern that the efficacy of virtual reality-assisted distraction from pain could potentially decrease with repeated exposure. The current finding that efficacy did not diminish over several repeated exposures provides support for the use of virtual reality as an adjuvant treatment of pain. © 2009 American Pain Society.",doi,10.1016/j.jpain.2008.09.016,Scopus,Journal of Pain,"Rutter C.E., Dahlquist L.M., Weiss K.E.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali

,Sympathetically Mediated Effects Of Mental Stress On The Cardiac Microcirculation Of Patients With Coronary Artery Disease,"Mental stress often causes myocardial ischemia in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). There is increasing evidence mat the coronary microcirculation of patients with atherosclerosis may be dysfunctional, with the potential of contributing to myocardial ischemia. This study investigated sympathetically mediated coronary microcirculatory and regional noradrenergic effects of mental stress. We measured left anterior descending coronary artery blood flow and norepinephrine kinetics at rest and during a 10-minute video game in 10 CAD patients with nonsignificant atherosclerosis of this artery and in 5 patients with normal coronary angiograms (NCA). The 2 groups did not differ in their responses of systemic and cardiac norepinephrine spillovers, heart rate, and blood pressure during mental stress. Patients with NCA had microvascular dilation during mental stress (26 ± 9% [mean ± SD] decline in coronary vascular resistance from baseline, p < 0.01), whereas patients with CAD did not (9 ± 20% decline, p = 0.11). Six patients with CAD then received intracoronary hentolamine (1.7 ng/kg/min for 5 minutes, followed by 0.17 μg/kg/min) and played the video game again. In contrast to nonsignificant changes in coronary resistance during the initial video game (6 ± 15% decline, p = 0.20), coronary vascular resistance decreased significantly during the repeat video game (25 ± 19% decline, p = 0.02). Vasomotor responses of epicardial coronary artery segments did not differ between the 2 video game studies. Five other patients (4 with CAD, 1 with NCA) repeated the video game during intracoronary administration of 5% dextrose, with systemic and coronary hemodynamic and noradrenergic responses unchanged from those during the initial video game. Thus, the coronary microcirculation of patients with CAD fails to dilate during mental stress, a response likely mediated by α-adrenoceptor activation mat may contribute to myocardial ischemia. © 1995 Excerpta Medica, Inc.

,"Technical Actions, Heart Rate, And Locomotor Activity In 7V7 And 8V8 Games For Female Youth Soccer Players","Ørntoft, C, Larsen, MN, Andersen, TB, Rasmussen, LS, Póvoas, SCA, Randers, MB, and Krustrup, P. Technical actions, heart rate, and locomotor activity in 7v7 and 8v8 games for female youth soccer players. J Strength Cond Res 30(12): 3298-3303, 2016-The purpose of this study was to evaluate technical performance, heart rate (HR), and activity profile in 7v7 and 8v8 soccer games for 9-to 10-year-old girls (U11). A total of 24 female youth players participated in the study, all playing 20-minute 7v7 and 8v8 games with 160 and 223 m 2 per player, respectively. Technical actions, HR, and activity profile were measured during the games using video filming, HR monitors, and 5-Hz Global positioning system (GPS) units. The number of technical actions was higher in 7v7 than in 8v8 games (34 ± 19 vs. 28 ± 14; p = 0.03; d = 0.37), as was the number of successful actions (25 ± 16 vs. 20 ± 12; p = 0.01; d = 0.35), with no difference in success rate for technical actions (70 ± 13 vs. 69 ± 14%; p = 0.63; d = 0.07). No differences were found between 7v7 and 8v8 in total distance covered (1,574 ± 251 and 1,622 ± 281 m; p = 0.66; d = 0.18), peak speed (19.5 ± 2.6 and 20.7 ± 1.5 km·h-1; p = 0.16; d = 0.56), mean HR values (85 ± 5 and 86 ± 6%HRpeak; p = 0.85; d = 0.18), and time of >90% HRpeak (37 ± 16 and 35 ± 14% of playing time; p = 0.70; d = 0.13). Distance covered at the highest running speeds of >16 km·h-1 was lower in 7v7 than in 8v8 games (34 ± 24 vs. 63 ± 34 m; p = 0.018; d = 0.98), as was the number of entries into this speed zone (8 ± 5 vs. 13 ± 7; p = 0.006; d = 0.82). In conclusion, more technical actions and successful actions were observed in 7v7 than in 8v8 games, but players covered more ground with high-speed running in 8v8 games. This study also revealed that HR values were high in both game formats for U11 adolescent female players, with no difference between formats. © 2016 National Strength and Conditioning Association.",doi,10.1519/JSC.0000000000001434,Scopus,Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research,"Ørntoft C., Larsen M.N., Andersen T.B., Rasmussen L.S., Póvoas S.C.A., Randers M.B., Krustrup P.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Technical And Physical Demands Of Small Vs. Large Sided Games In Relation To Playing Position In Elite Soccer,"The aim of this investigation was to compare the effects of common rule changes on technical and physical demands for elite soccer players in five playing positions during various 4-min small-sided games (SSGs) in comparison to 11-a-side matches. Forty international players classified into five positional roles participated in the study (25.3 ± 2.4. years, 182.4 ± 2.3. cm, 77.3 ± 4.1. kg; M ± SD). Players completed three different conditioned small-sided 4 vs. 4 games (1 ball touch. =1T, 2 ball touches. =2T and Free Play. =FP) as well as two friendly matches. Heart rate (HR), blood lactate ([La]), ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) as well as physical and technical performance were analyzed. Compared to match-play, total distance covered per minute of play, high-intensity running activities (sprinting and high-intensity runs), total numbers of duels and lost ball possessions were significantly greater within SSGs for all playing positions (p<. .05). In contrast, [La], percentage of successful passes and number of ball possessions were lower (p<. .05) within SSGs, particularly with 1T and 2T rules, in comparison with match-play. HR was higher in SSGs compared to match-play for all playing positions, and RPE values were lower (p<. .05) during the FP SSG for defensive midfielders, wide midfielders and forwards. In conclusion, this study revealed that 4 vs. 4 SSGs played with 1 or 2 ball touches increased the high-intensity running and the difficulty to perform technical actions, being more specific to match demands. Subsequently, it is of importance for coaches to understand the different physiological demands imposed upon players by varying the rules of SSGs and to understand the differences between positional roles. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",doi,10.1016/j.humov.2011.08.013,Scopus,Human Movement Science,"Dellal A., Owen A., Wong D.P., Krustrup P., van Exsel M., Mallo J.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Temporal Consistency Of Individual Differences In Cardiac Response To A Video Game,"Three experiments are reported which examined the temporal stability of cardiac reactions to a video game of the 'space invaders' genre. Experiment 1 also addressed the matter of inter-task consistency; in addition to the video game, subjects were presented with an unsignalled reaction time task and led to believe that relatively quick reactions attracted financial reward, while slower ones brought either a burst of loud noise or withdrawal of money previously earned. Forty-two male subjects were tested on both tasks on two occasions, a week apart. Of the two tasks, the video game elicited the greater reactivity. In addition, individual variations in reactivity showed striking temporal stability for both tasks. However, inter-task consistency was much less marked; in fact, a significant inter-task correlation was obtained only on the first occasion of testing. It is probable that limited consistency here was in some measure due to the ineffectiveness of our reaction time task in eliciting substantial reactivity. Finally, reactivity was independent of baseline heart rate level. In experiment 2, three extreme high and three extreme low cardiac reactors were selected from an initial sample of 23 male subjects, on the basis of reactivity during an initial session with the video game, and subsequently studied during four further sessions. Once more, impressive stability of heart rate reactivity was apparent over sessions. In experiment 3, we examined the reliability of individual variations in cardiac reactivity in women and the issue of whether temporal stability is constrained by menstrual cycle effects. Twenty-four females were tested on the video game both preovulatory and postovulatory, with half being tested first during the preovulatory phase and half being tested first during the postovulatory phase. Again, the most striking finding was the marked stability of individual variations in cardiac reactivity over both time and menstrual cycle phase. © 1984.",doi,10.1016/0301-0511(84)90048-6,Scopus,Biological Psychology,"Carroll D., Turner J.R., Lee H.J., Stephenson J.",1984,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,The Communicative Function Of Sad Facial Expressions,"What are the communicative functions of sad facial expressions? Research shows that people feel sadness in response to losses but it’s unclear whether sad expressions function to communicate losses to others and if so, what makes these signals credible. Here we use economic games to test the hypothesis that sad expressions lend credibility to claims of loss. Participants play the role of either a proposer or recipient in a game with a fictional backstory and real monetary payoffs. The proposers view a (fictional) video of the recipient’s character displaying either a neutral or sad expression paired with a claim of loss. The proposer then decided how much money to give to the recipient. In three experiments, we test alternative theories by using situations in which the recipient’s losses were uncertain (Experiment 1), the recipient’s losses were certain (Experiment 2), or the recipient claims failed gains rather than losses (Experiment 3). Overall, we find that participants gave more money to recipients who displayed sad expressions compared to neutral expressions, but only under conditions of uncertain loss. This finding supports the hypothesis that sad expressions function to increase the credibility of claims of loss. © The Author(s) 2017.",doi,10.1177/1474704917700418,Scopus,Evolutionary Psychology,"Reed L.I., DeScioli P.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,The Design Of The M-Health Service Application Using A Nintendo Ds Game Console,"In this article, we developed an m-health monitoring system using a Nintendo DS game console to demonstrate its utility. The proposed system consists of a biosignal acquisition device, wireless sensor network, base-station for signal reception from the sensor network and signal conversion according to Internet protocol, personal computer display program, and the Nintendo DS game console. The system collects three-channel electrocardiogram (ECG) signals for cardiac abnormality detection and three-axis accelerometer signals for fall detection of a person. The collected signals are then transmitted to the base-station through the wireless sensor network, where they are transformed according to the transmission control protocol/Internet protocol (TCP/IP) and sent to the destination IP through Internet network. To test the developed system, the collected signals were displayed on a computer located in different building through wired Internet network and also simultaneously displayed on the Nintendo DS game console connected to Internet network wirelessly. The system was able to collect and transmit signals for more than 24 h without any interruptions or malfunctions, showing the possibility of integrating healthcare monitoring functions into a small handheld-type electronic device developed for different purposes without significant complications. It is expected that the system can be used in an ambulance, nursing home, or general hospital where efficient patient monitoring from long distance is necessary. © Copyright 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",doi,10.1089/tmj.2010.0080,Scopus,Telemedicine and e-Health,"Lee S., Kim J., Lee M.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,"The Effect Of Advances In Video Game Technology And Content On Aggressive Cognitions, Hostility, And Heart Rate","Two studies were conducted that tested the moderating role of video game graphics quality in the relationship between video game content and aggression-related variables. In both studies, participants played either a violent or nonviolent video game on one of three video game systems with differing technological computing power (which contributes to the realism depicted in these video games). In Study 2, the moderating and mediating role of immersion was also tested. Results showed that video game violence exposure was related to aggressive cognitions and state of hostility. Video game technology did not moderate this relationship. Finally, immersion, as an individual difference variable, did not moderate or mediate this relationship. This suggests that aggressive cognitions and feelings occur independent of how technologically advanced the graphics are and the extent to which one feels as though they are immersed in a violent video game.

,The Effect Of Biofeedback Training On Affective Regulation And Simulated Car-Racing Performance: A Multiple Case Study Analysis,"The foundation of this study was based on an idiosyncratic concept, which uses probabilistic determinations (Kamata, Tenenbaum, & Hanin, 2002) to verify the utility and effectiveness of a biofeedback intervention by manipulating affective performance states in a race-car simulator. Nine males completed five separate time-trials of a simulated racing task and were then randomly assigned to one of three arousal regulation treatment conditions: (1) optimal, (2) poor, and (3) attention control. Following the biofeedback intervention, participants underwent another series of race trials to determine the effectiveness of the arousal regulation intervention. The results indicated that there were relative similarities in the strength and direction of the perceived and physiological states between the participants; however, the subtle details of the participants' unique performance zones and the probability of achieving each zone were revealed to be unique among the participants. The results also indicated that: (a) the biofeedback manipulation resulted in the expected changes for each participant, and (b) there were some large individual differences among the participants, necessitating the idiosyncratic approach. Limitations and future directions are also addressed. © 2008 Taylor & Francis.",doi,10.1080/02640410701813068,Scopus,Journal of Sports Sciences,"Edmonds W.A., Tenenbaum G., Mann D.T.Y., Johnson M., Kamata A.",2008,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,The Effect Of Repeated Exposure To Virtual Gambling Cues On The Urge To Gamble,"Introduction: This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of using a virtual reality (VR) casino environment in cue exposure therapy (CET) for gambling. The main objective of this study was to assess the ability of five VR casino cues to elicit subjective reactions and physiological responses that can be used within the CET paradigm. A second objective was to analyze changes in participants' urge to gamble after repeated exposure to a VR casino program and relaxation training. Methods: Twelve recreational gamblers were exposed to five virtual environments with casino-related cues that reproduced typical gambling situations. Self-reported subjective urges and psychophysiological responses were recorded during exposure. Results: All virtual environments with casino-related cues generated craving in recreational gamblers, whereas no increase in the psychophysiological variables was observed. In addition, urges to gamble elicited by VR casino environment reduced through repeated exposure and relaxation training. Conclusion: These findings provide evidence of the effectiveness of VR for simulating casino environments in the treatment of gambling. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.addbeh.2014.09.027,Scopus,Addictive Behaviors,"Park C.-B., Park S.M., Gwak A.R., Sohn B.K., Lee J.-Y., Jung H.Y., Choi S.-W., Kim D.J., Choi J.-S.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,"The Effect Of The Amount Of Blood In A Violent Video Game On Aggression, Hostility, And Arousal","The current study utilized the General Aggression Model, with an emphasis on aggression-related priming, to explore the different effects on hostility, physiological arousal, and state aggression in those who played a violent video game (Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance) with differing levels of blood (maximum, medium, low, and off). Simple effects analyses showed that those in the maximum blood and medium blood conditions had a significant increase in hostility and physiological arousal, while those in the low blood and no blood conditions did not have such an increase in arousal and hostility. Further analyses indicated that those in the maximum and medium blood conditions used the character's weapon significantly more often than those in the low and blood absent conditions.

,The Effect Of Video Game Violence On Physiological Desensitization To Real-Life Violence,"Past research shows that violent video game exposure increases aggressive thoughts, angry feelings, physiological arousal, aggressive behaviors, and decreases helpful behaviors. However, no research has experimentally examined violent video game effects on physiological desensitization, defined as showing less physiological arousal to violence in the real world after exposure to video game violence in the virtual world. This experiment attempts to fill this gap. Participants reported their media habits and then played one of eight violent or nonviolent video games for 20 min. Next, participants watched a 10-min videotape containing scenes of real-life violence while heart rate (HR) and galvanic skin response (GSR) were monitored. Participants who previously played a violent video game had lower HR and GSR while viewing filmed real violence, demonstrating a physiological desensitization to violence. Results are interpreted using an expanded version of the General Aggression Model. Links between desensitization, antisocial, and prosocial behavior are discussed. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

,The Effectiveness And Usability Of The Educational Software On Concept Education For Young Children With Impaired Hearing,"Early intervention and early education have a special place in educating the children with Impaired Hearing (IH). The advancements in information and communication technologies have led to adopting the view that such technologies could be applied in the educational process of the children with IH. Besides, the positive results acquired in the studies conducted in the light of this review have brought up the fact that proper technology-based educational environments should be provided and popularized for the young children with IH. In this study, educational software has been developed for the purpose of teaching emotions and opposite concepts to young children with IH. With this software, videos with topic descriptions, games reinforcing funny and topic-based learning, questions and audio-visual feedbacks have been used. The effectiveness of this software in concept education along with its usability by children has been examined; and in addition, the subjective viewpoints of the teachers of students with IH on this software have been consulted as well. © 2016 by iSER, International Society of Educational Research.",doi,10.12973/eurasia.2016.1207a,Scopus,"Eurasia Journal of Mathematics, Science and Technology Education","Goker H., Ozaydin L., Tekedere H.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,The Effects Of Imagery-Manipulated Appraisal On Intensity And Direction Of Competitive Anxiety,"This study attempted to manipulate an athlete's facilitative or debilitative appraisal (direction; Jones, 1995) of competitive anxiety through imagery-based interventions in order to study the effects on subsequent anxiety intensity (heart rate and CSAI-2) and direction (CSAI-2D; Jones & Swain, 1992). In a within-subjects' design, 24 experienced soccer players were relaxed via progressive relaxation audiotape and then randomly underwent an imagery-based video-and audiotaped manipulation of their appraisal of taking a hypothetical game-winning penalty kick under either a ""pressure"" or ""challenge"" appraisal emphasis. There was no significant effect for heart rate. A repeated measures MANOVA for CSAI-2 and CSAI-2D scores revealed that for both intensity and direction scores the challenge condition produced less cognitive anxiety, less somatic anxiety, and more self-confidence (all p < .001) than the pressure situation. This finding suggests that a challenge appraisal manipulation taught by applied sport psychologists might benefit athletes' performance.",doi,10.1123/tsp.12.1.40,Scopus,Sport Psychologist,"Hale B.D., Whitehouse A.",1998,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,The Effects Of Menstrual Cycle Phase On Cardiovascular And Pulmonary Responses To Behavioral And Exercise Stress,"The present study was designed to compare the differential cardiopulmonary and hemodynamic responses of Type A and B women to an exercise and a psychological stressor. In addition, the effects of menstrual cycle phase on the resting and response levels of a wide range of physiological variables were explored. Thirty‐two women participated in a progressive exercise stress test and a threat of shock video game during both the luteal and follicular phases of the menstrual cycle. Half of these subjects expressed the coronary‐prone behavior pattern referred to as Type A, as assessed by the Jenkins Activity Survey. The remaining women were relatively free of these behaviors (Type B). Heart rate, oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, minute ventilation, and end‐tidal carbon dioxide were monitored and recorded on a breath‐by‐breath basis. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure measures were taken at 2‐min intervals. Results indicated similar baseline, exercise, and behavioral stress responses among Type A and B women. The stress responses were also the same between the follicular and luteal phases for all measured physiological variables. However, resting levels of heart rate, metabolism, and ventilation were all elevated at rest during the luteal phase. A regression analysis based on the exercise heart rate and oxygen consumption data demonstrated that a majority of subjects exhibited heart rate responses in excess of that expected during the psychological stressor. These data are discussed with special reference to possible mechanisms of the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease. Copyright © 1986, Wiley Blackwell.

,The Effects Of Music On Time Perception And Performance Of A Driving Game,"Cassidy, G.G. & MacDonald, R.A.R. (2010). The effects of music on time perception and performance of a driving game. Scandinavian Journal of Psychology 51, 455-464.There is an established and growing body of evidence highlighting that music can influence behavior across a range of diverse domains (Miell, MacDonald, & Hargreaves 2005). One area of interest is the monitoring of ""internal timing mechanisms"", with features such as tempo, liking, perceived affective nature and everyday listening contexts implicated as important (North & Hargreaves, 2008). The current study addresses these issues by comparing the effects of self-selected and experimenter-selected music (fast and slow) on actual and perceived performance of a driving game activity. Seventy participants completed three laps of a driving game in seven sound conditions: (1) silence; (2) car sounds; (3) car sounds with self-selected music, and car sounds with experimenter-selected music; (4) high-arousal (70 bpm); (5) high-arousal (130 bpm); (6) low-arousal (70 bpm); and (7) low-arousal (130 bpm) music. Six performance measures (time, accuracy, speed, and retrospective perception of these), and four experience measures (perceived distraction, liking, appropriateness and enjoyment) were taken. Exposure to self-selected music resulted in overestimation of elapsed time and inaccuracy, while benefiting accuracy and experience. In contrast, exposure to experimenter-selected music resulted in poorest performance and experience. Increasing the tempo of experimenter-selected music resulted in faster performance and increased inaccuracy for high-arousal music, but did not impact experience. It is suggested that personal meaning and subjective associations connected to self-selected music promoted increased engagement with the activity, overriding detrimental effects attributed to unfamiliar, less liked and less appropriate experimenter-selected music. © 2010 The Authors.

,The Effects Of Scent And Game Play Experience On Memory Of A Virtual Environment,"Scent has been well documented as having significant effects on emotion (Alaoui-Ismaili in Physiol Behav 62(4):713 - 720, Herz et al. in Motiv Emot 28(4):363 - 383, learning (Smith et al. in Percept Mot Skills 74(2):339 - 343, 1992; Morgan in Percept Mot Skills 83(3)(2):1227 - 1234, 1996, memory (Herz in Am J Psychol 110(4):489 - 505, 1997) and task performance (Barker et al. in Percept Mot Skills 97(3)(1):1007 - 1010, 2003). This paper describes an experiment in which environmentally appropriate scent was presented as an additional sensory modality consistent with other aspects of a virtual environment called DarkCon. Subjects' game play habits were recorded as an additional factor for analysis. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive scent during the VE, and/or afterward during a task of recall of the environment. It was hypothesized that scent presentation during the VE would significantly improve recall, and that subjects who were presented with scent during the recall task, in addition to experiencing the scented VE, would perform the best on the recall task. Skin-conductance was a significant predictor of recall, over and above experimental groups. Finally, it was hypothesized that subjects' game play habits would affect both their behavior in and recall of the environment. Results are encouraging to the use of scent in virtual environments, and directions for future research are discussed. © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2007.",doi,10.1007/s10055-006-0056-0,Scopus,Virtual Reality,"Tortell R., Luigi D.P., Dozois A., Bouchard S., Morie J.F., Ilan D.",2007,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,The Effects Of Sympathetic Nervous System Activation And Psychological Stress On Glucose Metabolism And Blood Pressure In Subjects With Type 2 (Non-Insulin-Dependent) Diabetes Mellitus,"The sympathetic nervous system may contribute to excessive hepatic glucose output in Type 2 (non-insulin dependent) diabetes mellitus and could be implicated in the interrelated problem of hypertension. The aim of these studies was to determine whether subjects with Type 2 diabetes had normal sensitivity (compared with age- and weight-matched non-diabetic subjects) to noradrenaline infusion (60 ng · kg-1 · min-1 for 60 min) and to compare the responses with oral tyramine administration (800 mg), and psychological stress (using competitive computer games). Noradrenaline infusion caused significantly greater plasma glucose (mean increment 2.1±0.4 vs 0.6±0.1 mmol/l, p&lt;0.005) and pressor responses (mean systolic increment 21±3 vs 11±1mm Hg, p&lt;0.02) in the diabetic subjects. The excessive glycaemia was due to increased hepatic glucose output rather than reduced glucose disposal. Tyramine administration caused significantly increased hepatic glucose output and plasma glucose levels, but with similar responses in the diabetic and non-diabetic subjects; the pulse and pressor responses were also similar between the groups. The psychological stressor induced significant increases in pulse, blood pressure and non-esterified fatty acid levels in the combined group of subjects (p&lt;0.01) but did not influence plasma glucose levels in either diabetic or non-diabetic subjects. We conclude that pharmacologically-induced sympathetic nervous stimulation can induce hyperglycaemia. Subjects with uncomplicated Type 2 diabetes have increased sensitivity to exogenous noradrenaline but may not hyperrespond to endogenous sympathetic activation. © 1992 Springer-Verlag.",doi,10.1007/BF00399929,Scopus,Diabetologia,"Bruce D.G., Chisholm D.J., Storlien L.H., Kraegen E.W., Smythe G.A.",1992,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,"The Effects Of Technological Advancement And Violent Content In Video Games On Players' Feelings Of Presence, Involvement, Physiological Arousal, And Aggression","The possible impact of technological advancement on video games' effects - particularly in the case of violent games - has often been discussed but has not been thoroughly explored by empirical research. The present investigation employed a 2 × 2 between-subjects factorial experiment to examine the interplay of technological advancement and violence by exposing participants (N = 120) to either a newer or older version of a violent or nonviolent game and measuring these factors' effects on players' sense of presence, involvement, physiological arousal (measured by skin conductance), self-reported arousal, and affective and cognitive aggression. The results indicate that technological advancement increased participants' sense of presence, involvement, and physiological and self-reported arousal. Neither advancement nor violence had statistically significant effects on accessibility of players' aggressive thoughts, but there is some tentative evidence that violent game content increased players' state hostility.

,The Expressive Gaze Model: Using Gaze To Express Emotion,"Gaze is an important but understudied signal for displaying emotion. The Expressive Gaze Model (EGM) is a hierarchical framework for composing simple behaviors into emotionally expressive gaze in virtual characters that encompasses eye, torso, and head movement. The EGM's primary components are the Gaze Warping Transformation (GWT), which generates emotionally expressive head and torso movement in a gaze shift, and an eye movement model. Researchers have used the EGM to produce several types of gaze shift, both with and without explicit emotional behavior. © 2010 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/MCG.2010.43,Scopus,IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications,"Lance B., Marsella S.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,The Feasibility Of Ambulatory Screen Time In Children,"Purpose. A walking media station was developed, which enables normally seated screen activities to be conducted whilst walking. This study tests feasibility of the walking media station and provides preliminary evidence of the acceptability of the device in the home environment. Methods. Twenty-nine healthy children (mean age 9.6 years) participated in the testing of the newly developed walking media station in the laboratory and in the home environment. Results. Steady gait walking at1 km.hr-1 was achieved by all the children in less than 1 minute. There was no significant difference between computer game score during seated and walking play modes and no increase in energy cost when computer game play was added to walking (p &gt; 0.05). When given the choice in the home, all chose to use the walking media station rather than play seated. When asked: ""If this unit were yours to keep forever, would you play video games on it?"" all responded affirmatively. Conclusion. These data demonstrate that when given a walking media station, children can and will use it. Re-engineering regular walking into otherwise seated gaming minimizes disruption to normal routines and provides an innovative and creative opportunity for further investigation into the sustainability and clinical outcomes of reducing sitting time and increasing physical activity.",doi,10.1080/17477160802315002,Scopus,International Journal of Pediatric Obesity,"Mellecker R.R., McManus A.M., Lanningham-Foster L.M., Levine J.A.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,The Future Of Earth Observation In Hydrology,"In just the past 5 years, the field of Earth observation has progressed beyond the offerings of conventional space-agency-based platforms to include a plethora of sensing opportunities afforded by CubeSats, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and smartphone technologies that are being embraced by both for-profit companies and individual researchers. Over the previous decades, space agency efforts have brought forth well-known and immensely useful satellites such as the Landsat series and the Gravity Research and Climate Experiment (GRACE) system, with costs typically of the order of 1 billion dollars per satellite and with concept-to-launch timelines of the order of 2 decades (for new missions). More recently, the proliferation of smartphones has helped to miniaturize sensors and energy requirements, facilitating advances in the use of CubeSats that can be launched by the dozens, while providing ultra-high (3- 5 m) resolution sensing of the Earth on a daily basis. Startup companies that did not exist a decade ago now operate more satellites in orbit than any space agency, and at costs that are a mere fraction of traditional satellite missions. With these advances come new space-borne measurements, such as real-time high-definition video for tracking air pollution, storm-cell development, flood propagation, precipitation monitoring, or even for constructing digital surfaces using structure-from-motion techniques. Closer to the surface, measurements from small unmanned drones and tethered balloons have mapped snow depths, floods, and estimated evaporation at sub-metre resolutions, pushing back on spatio-temporal constraints and delivering new process insights. At ground level, precipitation has been measured using signal attenuation between antennae mounted on cell phone towers, while the proliferation of mobile devices has enabled citizen scientists to catalogue photos of environmental conditions, estimate daily average temperatures from battery state, and sense other hydrologically important variables such as channel depths using commercially available wireless devices. Global internet access is being pursued via highaltitude balloons, solar planes, and hundreds of planned satellite launches, providing a means to exploit the ""internet of things"" as an entirely new measurement domain. Such global access will enable real-time collection of data from billions of smartphones or from remote research platforms. This future will produce petabytes of data that can only be accessed via cloud storage and will require new analytical approaches to interpret. The extent to which today's hydrologic models can usefully ingest such massive data volumes is unclear. Nor is it clear whether this deluge of data will be usefully exploited, either because the measurements are superfluous, inconsistent, not accurate enough, or simply because we lack the capacity to process and analyse them. What is apparent is that the tools and techniques afforded by this array of novel and game-changing sensing platforms present our community with a unique opportunity to develop new insights that advance fundamental aspects of the hydrological sciences. To accomplish this will require more than just an application of the technology: in some cases, it will demand a radical rethink on how we utilize and exploit these new observing systems. © Author(s) 2017.",doi,10.5194/hess-21-3879-2017,Scopus,Hydrology and Earth System Sciences,"McCabe M.F., Rodell M., Alsdorf D.E., Miralles D.G., Uijlenhoet R., Wagner W., Lucieer A., Houborg R., Verhoest N.E.C., Franz T.E., Shi J., Gao H., Wood E.F.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,The Health Benefits Of Interactive Video Game Exercise,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of interactive video games (combined with stationary cycling) on health-related physical fitness and exercise adherence in comparison with traditional aerobic training (stationary cycling alone). College-aged males were stratified (aerobic fitness and body mass) and then assigned randomly to experimental (n = 7) or control (n = 7) conditions. Program attendance, health-related physical fitness (including maximal aerobic power (VO2 max), body composition, muscular strength, muscular power, and flexibility), and resting blood pressure were measured before and after training (60%-75% heart rate reserve, 3 d/week for 30 min/d for 6 weeks). There was a significant difference in the attendance of the interactive video game and traditional training groups (78% ± 18% vs. 48% ± 29%, respectively). VO2 max was significantly increased after interactive video game (11% ± 5%) but not traditional (3% ± 6%) training. There was a significantly greater reduction in resting systolic blood pressure after interactive video game (132 ± 6 vs. 123 ± 6 mmHg) than traditional (131 ± 7 vs. 128 ± 8 mmHg) training. There were no significant changes in body composition after either training program. Attendance mediated the relationships between condition and changes in health outcomes (including VO2 max, vertical jump, and systolic blood pressure). The present investigation indicates that a training program that links interactive video games to cycle exercise results in greater improvements in health-related physical fitness than that seen after traditional cycle exercise training. It appears that greater attendance, and thus a higher volume of physical activity, is the mechanism for the differences in health-related physical fitness. © 2007 NRC.",doi,10.1139/H07-038,Scopus,"Applied Physiology, Nutrition and Metabolism","Warburton D.E.R., Bredin S.S.D., Horita L.T.L., Zbogar D., Scott J.M., Esch B.T.A., Rhodes R.E.",2007,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,The Ideal Self At Play: The Appeal Of Video Games That Let You Be All You Can Be,"Video games constitute a popular form of entertainment that allows millions of people to adopt virtual identities. In our research, we explored the idea that the appeal of games is due in part to their ability to provide players with novel experiences that let them ""try on"" ideal aspects of their selves that might not find expression in everyday life. We found that video games were most intrinsically motivating and had the greatest influence on emotions when players' experiences of themselves during play were congruent with players' conceptions of their ideal selves. Additionally, we found that high levels of immersion in gaming environments, as well as large discrepancies between players' actual-self and ideal-self characteristics, magnified the link between intrinsic motivation and the experience of ideal-self characteristics during play. © The Author(s) 2012.",doi,10.1177/0956797611418676,Scopus,Psychological Science,"Przybylski A.K., Weinstein N., Murayama K., Lynch M.F., Ryan R.M.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,The Influence Of Combined Cognitive Plus Social-Cognitive Training On Amygdala Response During Face Emotion Recognition In Schizophrenia,"Both cognitive and social-cognitive deficits impact functional outcome in schizophrenia. Cognitive remediation studies indicate that targeted cognitive and/or social-cognitive training improves behavioral performance on trained skills. However, the neural effects of training in schizophrenia and their relation to behavioral gains are largely unknown. This study tested whether a 50-h intervention which included both cognitive and social-cognitive training would influence neural mechanisms that support social ccognition. Schizophrenia participants completed a computer-based intervention of either auditory-based cognitive training (AT) plus social-cognition training (SCT) (N=11) or non-specific computer games (CG) (N=11). Assessments included a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) task of facial emotion recognition, and behavioral measures of cognition, social cognition, and functional outcome. The fMRI results showed the predicted group-by-time interaction. Results were strongest for emotion recognition of happy, surprise and fear: relative to CG participants, AT+SCT participants showed a neural activity increase in bilateral amygdala, right putamen and right medial prefrontal cortex. Across all participants, pre-to-post intervention neural activity increase in these regions predicted behavioral improvement on an independent emotion perception measure (MSCEIT: Perceiving Emotions). Among AT+SCT participants alone, neural activity increase in right amygdala predicted behavioral improvement in emotion perception. The findings indicate that combined cognition and social-cognition training improves neural systems that support social-cognition skills. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.pscychresns.2013.04.001,Scopus,Psychiatry Research - Neuroimaging,"Hooker C.I., Bruce L., Fisher M., Verosky S.C., Miyakawa A., D'Esposito M., Vinogradov S.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,The Mental Simulation Of Better And Worse Possible Worlds,"Counterfactual thinking involves the imagination of non-factual alternatives to reality. We investigated the spontaneous generation of both upward counterfactuals, which improve on reality, and downward counterfactuals, which worsen reality. All subjects gained $5 playing a computer-simulated blackjack game. However, this outcome was framed to be perceived as either a win, a neutral event, or a loss. “Loss” frames produced more upward and fewer downward counterfactuals than did either “win” or “neutral” frames, but the overall prevalence of counterfactual thinking did not vary with outcome valence. In addition, subjects who expected to play the game again made more upward counterfactuals and were less satisfied with the outcome than were subjects who did not expect to play again. However, once subjects saw the cards from which they could have selected had they ""hit"" again (two winning cards and two losing cards), all subjects generated primarily upward counterfactuals and showed a corresponding decrease in satisfaction. These results implicate both cognitive and motivational factors in the generation of counterfactuals and tell us something about the functional value of counterfactual thinking: downward counterfactuals provide comfort; upward counterfactuals prepare one for the future. © 1993 by Academic Press, Inc.",doi,10.1006/jesp.1993.1005,Scopus,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,"Markman K.D., Gavanski I., Sherman S.J., McMullen M.N.",1993,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,The Motivating Role Of Violence In Video Games,"Six studies, two survey based and four experimental, explored the relations between violent content and people's motivation and enjoyment of video game play. Based on self-determination theory, the authors hypothesized that violence adds little to enjoyment or motivation for typical players once autonomy and competence need satisfactions are considered. As predicted, results from all studies showed that enjoyment, value, and desire for future play were robustly associated with the experience of autonomy and competence in gameplay. Violent content added little unique variance in accounting for these outcomes and was also largely unrelated to need satisfactions. The studies also showed that players high in trait aggression were more likely to prefer or value games with violent contents, even though violent contents did not reliably enhance their game enjoyment or immersion. Discussion focuses on the significance of the current findings for individuals and the understanding of motivation in virtual environments. © 2009 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.",doi,10.1177/0146167208327216,Scopus,Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin,"Przybylski A.K., Ryan R.M., Rigby C.S.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,The Neural Bases Of Cooperation And Competition: An Fmri Investigation,"Cooperation and competition are two basic modes of social cognition that necessitate monitoring of both one's own and others' actions, as well as adopting a specific mental set. In this fMRI, study individuals played a specially designed computer game, according to a set of predefined rules, either in cooperation with or in competition against another person. The hemodynamic response during these conditions was contrasted to that of the same subjects playing the game independently. Both cooperation and competition stances resulted in activation of a common frontoparietal network subserving executive functions, as well as the anterior insula, involved in autonomic arousal. Moreover, distinct regions were found to be selectively associated with cooperation and competition, notably the orbitofrontal cortex in the former and the inferior parietal and medial prefrontal cortices in the latter. This pattern reflects the different mental frameworks implicated in being cooperative versus competitive with another person. In accordance with evidence from evolutionary psychology as well as from developmental psychology, we argue that cooperation is a socially rewarding process and is associated with specific left medial orbitofrontal cortex involvement. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

,The Neurodynamics Of Affect In The Laboratory Predicts Persistence Of Real-World Emotional Responses,"Failure to sustain positive affect over time is a hallmark of depression and other psychopathologies, but the mechanisms supporting the ability to sustain positive emotional responses are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the neural correlates associated with the persistence of positive affect in the real world by conducting two experiments in humans: an fMRI task of reward responses and an experience-sampling task measuring emotional responses to a reward obtained in the field. The magnitude of DLPFC engagement to rewards administered in the laboratory predicted reactivity of real-world positive emotion following a reward administered in the field. Sustained ventral striatum engagement in the laboratory positively predicted the duration of real-world positive emotional responses. These results suggest that common pathways are associated with the unfolding of neural processes over seconds and with the dynamics of emotions experienced over minutes. Examining such dynamics may facilitate a better understanding of the brain-behavior associations underlying emotion. © 2015, the authors.",doi,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0569-15.2015,Scopus,Journal of Neuroscience,"Heller A.S., Fox A.S., Wing E.K., McQuisition K.M., Vack N.J., Davidson R.J.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,The Oxytocin Receptor (Oxtr) Contributes To Prosocial Fund Allocations In The Dictator Game And The Social Value Orientations Task,"Background: Economic games observe social decision making in the laboratory that involves real money payoffs. Previously we have shown that allocation of funds in the Dictator Game (DG), a paradigm that illustrates costly altruistic behavior, is partially determined by promoter-region repeat region variants in the arginine vasopressin 1a receptor gene (AVPR1a). In the current investigation, the gene encoding the related oxytocin receptor (OXTR) was tested for association with the DG and a related paradigm, the Social Values Orientation (SVO) task. Methodology/Principal Findings: Association (101 male and 102 female students) using a robust-family based test between 15 single tagging SNPs (htSNPs) across the OXTR was demonstrated with both the DG and SVO. Three htSNPs across the gene region showed significant association with both of the two games. The most significant association was observed with rs1042778 (p=0.001). Haplotype analysis also showed significant associations for both DG and SVO. Following permutation test adjustment, significance was observed for 2-5 locus haplotypes (p<0.05). A second sample of 98 female subjects was subsequently and independently recruited to play the dictator game and was genotyped for the three significant SNPs found in the first sample. The rs1042778 SNP was shown to be significant for the second sample as well (p=0.004, Fisher's exact test). Conclusions: The demonstration that genetic polymorphisms for the OXTR are associated with human prosocial decision making converges with a large body of animal research showing that oxytocin is an important social hormone across vertebrates including Homo sapiens. Individual differences in prosocial behavior have been shown by twin studies to have a substantial genetic basis and the current investigation demonstrates that common variants in the oxytocin receptor gene, an important element of mammalian social circuitry, underlie such individual differences. © 2009 Israel et al.",doi,10.1371/journal.pone.0005535,Scopus,PLoS ONE,"Israel S., Lerer E., Shalev I., Uzefovsky F., Riebold M., Laiba E., Bachner-Melman R., Maril A., Bornstein G., Knafo A., Ebstein R.P.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,The Power Of Words At Mega-Event Opening Ceremonies,"This article analyzes the opening speech of John Furlong, CEO of the Vancouver Organizing Committee for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games, at the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympic Games. The main idea here is the great importance of a speech at the opening ceremony of a mega-event. The characteristics of the speech were analyzed through the speaker's choice of words (figures of speech and rhetorical devices). The role of the speech was analyzed to show how the main event concept is promoted. The research is divided into two parts. The first presents a review of the literature and of other relevant resources such as video material and web pages as a basis for preparing the theoretical part of the article. In the second, more empirically oriented part of the article, we conducted a linguistic analysis involving an indepth discourse analyses of John Furlong's speech and the analyses of syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. Through the review of the literature and of other resources, we have established the importance of an additional Olympic theme along with the main sport-related theme. The empirical research that is based on the discourse analyses shows that, despite its brevity, John Furlong's speech stresses the theme and the values of the mega-event, and it is also highly communicative, incorporating the various significant semantics and pragmatics of a good speech: Brevity, simple words and sentences, colloquial language, relating to the audiences, employing stylistic and grammatical devices, appealing to the audience's feelings and emotions, and the delivery with appropriate rhythm, emphasis, and pauses. When conducting the research, we were unable to identify any other studies that have undertaken a detailed analysis of this speech. There are numerous analyses of how the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympic Games were prepared and also staged. We have also found some that focused on the theme of the event, but none focused on how the message of the event was delivered to the general public and the residents of host communities. This strengthens the originality and importance of our research. © 2016 Cognizant, LLC.",doi,10.3727/109830416X14750895902710,Scopus,"Tourism, Culture and Communication","Gorenak M., Topler J.P.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,The Prevalence Of Triggers In Paediatric Migraine: A Questionnaire Study In 102 Children And Adolescents,"The prevalence and characterization of migraine triggers have not been rigorously studied in children and adolescents. Using a questionnaire, we retrospectively studied the prevalence of 15 predefined trigger factors in a clinic-based population. In 102 children and adolescents fulfilling the Second Edition of The International Headache Classification criteria for paediatric migraine, at least one migraine trigger was reported by the patient and/or was the parents' interpretation in 100% of patients. The mean number of migraine triggers reported per subject was 7. Mean time elapsed between exposure to a trigger factor and attack onset was comprised between 0 and 3 h in 88 patients (86%). The most common individual trigger was stress (75.5% of patients), followed by lack of sleep (69.6%), warm climate (68.6%) and video games (64.7%). Stress was also the most frequently reported migraine trigger always associated with attacks (24.5%). In conclusion, trigger factors were frequently reported by children and adolescents with migraine and stress was the most frequent. © The Author(s) 2011.",doi,10.1007/s10194-011-0397-2,Scopus,Journal of Headache and Pain,"Neut D., Fily A., Cuvellier J.-C., Vallée L.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,The Relationship Between Specific Cognitive Impairment And Behaviour In Prader-Willi Syndrome,"Background Individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) have been shown to demonstrate a particular cognitive deficit in attention switching and high levels of preference for routine and temper outbursts. This study assesses whether a specific pathway between a cognitive deficit and behaviour via environmental interaction can exist in individuals with PWS.Methods Four individuals with PWS participated in a series of three single-case experiments including laboratory-based and natural environment designs. Cognitive (computer-based) challenges placed varying demands on attention switching or controlled for the cognitive demands of the tasks while placing no demands on switching. Unexpected changes to routines or expectations were presented in controlled games, or imposed on participants' natural environments and compared with control conditions during which no unexpected changes occurred. Behaviour was observed and heart rate was measured.Results Participants showed significantly increased temper outburst related behaviours during cognitive challenges that placed demands on attention switching, relative to the control cognitive challenges. Participants showed significantly increased temper outburst related behaviours when unexpected changes occurred in an experimental or the natural environment compared with when no changes occurred.Conclusions Difficult behaviours that could be triggered reliably in an individual by a specific cognitive demand could also be triggered via manipulation of the environment. Results suggest that a directional relationship between a specific cognitive deficit and behaviour, via environmental interaction, can exist in individuals with PWS. © 2011 The Authors.

,The Reverse Monte Carlo Localization Algorithm,"Global localization is a very fundamental and challenging problem in Robotic Soccer. Here, the main aim is to find the best method which is very robust and fast and requires less computational resources and memory compared to similar approaches and is precise enough for robot soccer games and technical challenges. In this work, the Reverse Monte Carlo localization (R-MCL) method is introduced. The algorithm is designed for fast, precise and robust global localization of autonomous robots in the robotic soccer domain, to overcome the uncertainties in the sensors, environment and the motion model. R-MCL is a hybrid method based on Markov localization (ML) and Monte Carlo localization (MCL), where the ML based module finds the region where the robot should be and the MCL based part predicts the geometrical location with high precision by selecting samples in this region. It is called Reverse since the MCL routine is applied in a reverse manner in this algorithm. In this work, this method is tested on a challenging data set that is used by many other researchers and compared in terms of error rate against different levels of noise, and sparsity. Additionally, the time required to recover from kidnapping and the processing time of the methods are tested and compared. According to the test results R-MCL is a considerable method against high sparsity and noise. It is preferable when its recovery from kidnapping and processing times are considered. It gives robust and fast but relatively coarse position estimations against imprecise and inadequate perceptions, and coarse action data, including regular misplacements, and false perceptions. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

,The Specificity Of Rugby Union Training Sessions In Preparation For Match Demands.,"Investigations into the specificity of rugby union training practices in preparation for competitive demands has predominantly focussed on physical and physiological demands. The evaluation of the contextual variance in perceptual strain or skill requirements between training and matches in rugby union is unclear, yet holistic understanding may assist to optimise training design. This study evaluated the specificity of physical, physiological, perceptual and skill demands of training sessions compared with competitive match-play in pre-professional, elite club rugby union. Global positioning system (GPS) devices, video capture, heart rate (HR), and session ratings of perceived exertion (sRPE) were used to assess movement patterns, skill completions, physiologic, and perceptual responses, respectively. Data were collected across a season (training sessions n=29; matches n=14). Participants (n=32) were grouped in playing positions as: outside backs, centres, halves, loose forwards, lock forwards, and front row forwards. Greater total distance, low-intensity activity, maximal speed and metres per min were apparent in matches compared to training in all positions (P<0.02; d>0.90). Similarly, match HR, and sRPE responses were higher than those recorded in training (P<0.05; d>0.8). Key skill completions for forwards (i.e., scrums, rucks and lineouts) and backs (i.e., kicks) were greater under match conditions than in training (P<0.001; d>1.50). Considerable disparities exist between the perceptual, physiological, and key skill demands of competitive matches versus training sessions in pre-professional rugby union players. Practitioners should consider the specificity of training tasks for pre-professional rugby players to ensure the best preparation for match demands.",doi,10.1123/ijspp.2017-0082,pubmed,International journal of sports physiology and performance,"Campbell, Patrick G; Peake, Jonathan M; Minett, Geoffrey M",2017,NA,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,"The Value Of Art In Bioshock: Ayn Rand, Emotion, And Choice","BioShock made a big splash not only for the depth of its subject matter, but also for the way it utilized its video game medium to present its big ideas in a uniquely engaging way. The game weaves many themes into its complicated narrative, complete with shifting identities, science fiction superpowers, and survival-horror overtones. It is clear that BioShock wants to be taken as a spiritual sequel to Rand's philosophical novel Atlas Shrugged, revealing a possible fate for John Galt's mysterious hidden utopia, sought after for much of the novel but never fully revealed, as the book ends just before Galt discloses his society and its plans for the world. Rand develops her philosophy through fiction because she defines art as a selective re-creation of reality according to an artist's perspective. That is, a work of art is an artist's take on what it is to be human. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.All rights reserved.",doi,10.1002/9781118915899.ch2,Scopus,"BioShock and Philosophy: Irrational Game, Rational Book",Rose J.,2015,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Thermal Management Of Low Profile Electronic Equipment Using Radial Fans And Heat Sinks,"There is an increasing need for low profile thermal management solutions for applications in the range of 5-10 W, targeted at portable electronic devices. This need is emerging due to enhanced power dissipation levels in portable electronics, such as mobile phones, portable gaming machines, and ultraportable personal computers. This work focuses on the optimization of such a solution within the constraints of the profile and footprint area. A number of fan geometries have been investigated where both the inlet and exit rotor angles are varied relative to the heat conducting fins on a heat sink. The ratio of the fan diameter to the heat sink fin length was also varied. The objective was to determine the optimal solution from a thermal management perspective within the defined constraints. The results show a good thermal performance and highlight the need to develop the heat sink and fan as an integrated thermal solution rather than in isolation as is the traditional methodology. An interesting finding is that the heat transfer scales are in line with turbulent rather than laminar correlations despite the low Reynolds number. It is also found that while increasing the pumping power generally improves the thermal performance, only small gains are achieved for relatively large pumping power increases. This is important in optimizing portable systems where reduced power consumption is a competitive advantage in the marketplace. © 2008 by ASME.",doi,10.1115/1.2977602,Scopus,Journal of Heat Transfer,"Walsh E., Walsh P., Grimes R., Egan V.",2008,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Thermal Treatment Of The Minority Game,"We study a cost function for the aggregate behavior of all the agents involved in the minority game (MG) or the bar attendance model (BAM). The cost function allows us to define a deterministic, synchronous dynamic that yields results that have the main relevant features than those of the probabilistic, sequential dynamics used for the MG or the BAM. We define a temperature through a Langevin approach in terms of the fluctuations of the average attendance. We prove that the cost function is an extensive quantity that can play the role of an internal energy of the many-agent system while the temperature so defined is an intensive parameter. We compare the results of the thermal perturbation to the deterministic dynamics and prove that they agree with those obtained with the MG or BAM in the limit of very low temperature. © 2002 The American Physical Society.",doi,10.1103/PhysRevE.65.036711,Scopus,"Physical Review E - Statistical Physics, Plasmas, Fluids, and Related Interdisciplinary Topics","Burgos E., Ceva H., Perazzo R.P.J.",2002,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Time-Varying Linear Pursuit-Evasion Game Models With Bounded Controls,"Future end game interception scenarios of autonomous uncrewed flying vehicles are expected to be characterized by variable velocities and lateral acceleration limits. A time-varying linear pursuit-evasion game model with bounded controls is presented that can be used to analyze such scenarios. The usefulness of this model is demonstrated by simulations of a realistic ballistic missile defense scenario, as an example. It is shown that a differential game guidance law derived using this time-varying model provides a significant improvement in the homing accuracy compared to a guidance law based on a model with constant velocities and lateral acceleration limits. Moreover, the time-varying linear model provides a much more accurate prediction of the miss distance, confirming its validity. Also a general review of possible structures of the game space decomposition is presented. One of these structures implies that even if the pursuer does not have a maneuverability advantage over the evader, but has an agility advantage, a zero miss distance can still be achieved for some initial conditions.",doi,10.2514/2.4927,Scopus,"Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics","Shima T., Shinar J.",2002,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Time Loss Whilst Playing Video Games: Is There A Relationship To Addictive Behaviours?,"At present, little is known about why subjective time loss occurs whilst playing video games other than that it may relate to features of escape, immersion and arousal-all of which have been implicated in the development of addictive behaviours. This study examined subjective time loss of 40 undergraduate students (26 males and 14 females with a mean age of 21.4 years) whilst playing one of two video games in an experimental setting. Mood state before and after game playing was also examined using the Profile of Mood States-Short Form (POMS-SF, Grove & Prapavessis, 1992). Results found that, females significantly underestimated the time that they were playing compared to males. Total Mood Disturbance increased after playing one of the games, but only for participants who reported that they would liked to have continued playing for longer. There were no gender differences in relation to mood state. It is concluded that time loss is not (in itself) a precipitating or facilitating factor relating to addictive behaviour patterns. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007.",doi,10.1007/s11469-006-9048-2,Scopus,International Journal of Mental Health and Addiction,"Wood R.T.A., Griffiths M.D.",2007,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali

,"Toward A Conceptual Model Of Motive And Self-Control In Cyber-Aggression: Rage, Revenge, Reward, And Recreation","Despite widespread public attention to cyberbullying, online aggression and victimization have received scant conceptual development. This article focuses on how opportunities for aggression are distinct online from those of offline social contexts. The model developed here is informed by a recent aggression typology, which extends the reactive-proactive distinction by distinguishing aggression based on the affective motive (appetitive vs. reactive) and the recruitment of self-control. This typology informs an analysis of psychological processes linked to individual differences that are relevant to adolescents' aggressive activities. Processes implicated include hostile schema activation, anger and fatigue effects on self-control, anger rumination, empathic failure, excitation transfer, and thrill-seeking. With these processes established, the proposed model focuses on how features of online social platforms may afford opportunities for distinct types of aggression by engaging these processes in adolescent users. Features of online settings that present distinct opportunities for activation of these processes are reviewed for each process, including social cue ambiguity, temporal lag, cue permanence, anonymity, the continual perception of audience, and the availability of online gaming and online pornography. For each of the conceptually grounded cyber-aggression-relevant processes, implications for innovative research directions on adolescent cyber-aggression are presented. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",doi,10.1007/s10964-013-9936-2,Scopus,Journal of Youth and Adolescence,Runions K.C.,2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali

,Towards A Trajectory Planning Concept: Augmenting Path Planning Methods By Considering Speed Limit Constraints,"Trajectory planning is an essential part of systems controlling autonomous entities such as vehicles or robots. It requires not only finding spatial curves but also that dynamic properties of the vehicles (such as speed limits for certain maneuvers) must be followed. In this paper, we present an approach for augmenting existing path planning methods to support basic dynamic constraints, concretely speed limit constraints. We apply this approach to the well known Astate-of-the-art ThetaLazy Thetapath planning algorithms. We use a concept of trajectory planning based on a modular architecture in which spatial and dynamic parts can be easily implemented. This concept allows dynamic aspects to be processed during planning. Existing systems based on a similar concept usually add dynamics (velocity) into spatial curves in a post-processing step which might be inappropriate when the curves do not follow the dynamics. Many existing trajectory planning approaches, especially in mobile robotics, encode dynamic aspects directly in the representation (e.g. in the form of regular lattices) which requires a precise knowledge of the environmental and dynamic properties of particular autonomous entities making designing and implementing such trajectory planning approaches quite difficult. The concept of trajectory planning we implemented might not be as precise but the modular architecture makes the design and implementation easier because we can use (modified) well known path planning methods and define models of dynamics of autonomous entities separately. This seems to be appropriate for simulations used in feasibility studies for some complex autonomous systems or in computer games etc. Our basic implementation of the augmented A, ThetaLazy Thetaalgorithms is also experimentally evaluated. We compare (i) the augmented and basic A, ThetaLazy Thetaalgorithms and (ii) optimizing of augmented ThetaLazy Thetafor distance (the trajectory length) and duration (time needed to move through the trajectory). © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",doi,10.1007/s10846-013-9886-7,Scopus,Journal of Intelligent and Robotic Systems: Theory and Applications,"Chrpa L., Osborne H.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Traditional Games Resulted In Post-Exercise Hypotension And A Lower Cardiovascular Response To The Cold Pressor Test In Healthy Children,"The present study aimed to verify if blood pressure (BP) reactivity could be reduced through a previous single session of active playing when compared to sedentary leisure. Sixteen pre-pubertal healthy children participated in this study. After familiarization with procedures and anthropometric evaluation, participants performed three sessions in randomized order: (1) 30 min of traditional Brazilian games (PLAY); (2) 30 min of video game playing (DDR); and (3) 30 min of watching TV (TV). Each session lasted 80 min, being 10 min of rest; 30 min of intervention activity; and 40 min of recovery. After recovery, the Cold Pressor Test (CPT) was used for the assessment of acute cardiovascular reactivity. BP was recorded at 30 s and 1 min during the CPT. Analysis of variance showed post-exercise hypotension (PEH) only after PLAY, and that systolic and diastolic BP were significantly increased in all conditions during CPT. However, the magnitude of the CPT-induced BP response was significantly less in PLAY compared to DDR and TV. The PEH observed during recovery and the reduced BP response to CPT following playing traditional games may be due its higher cardiovascular and metabolic demand as was indicated by the increased heart rate, oxygen consumption, and BP. It was concluded that BP reactivity to stress may be reduced through a previous single session of traditional games and that PEH was recorded only after this exercise form. This benefit indicates a potential role of playing strategies for cardiovascular health in childhood. © 2014 Rauber, Boullosa, Carvalho, de Moraes, de Sousa, Simões and Campbell.",doi,10.3389/fphys.2014.00235,Scopus,Frontiers in Physiology,"Rauber S.B., Boullosa A.

,Tunnel Vision Or Desensitization? The Effect Of Interactivity And Frequency Of Use On The Perception And Evaluation Of Violence In Digital Games,"Most of the studies on violence in digital games have investigated its effects on arousal or aggression. Little attention has been paid to how in-game violence is actually perceived and evaluated. To investigate this issue we conducted two experimental studies (N = 30 and N = 74) in which participants either played or watched a violent shooter game and reported how they perceived and evaluated the violent content. Results showed that playing the games led to an increased awareness for in-game violence, but also to less-negative subjective evaluations of the violent content. Gaming frequency had a negative effect on both the perception and evaluation of in-game violence, suggesting a desensitization effect. The results of our studies illustrate that individual perceptions and evaluations of violence in digital games have to be taken into account when studying their effects. Implications for further research and the system of age ratings are discussed based on our findings.",doi,10.1027/1864-1105/a000122,Scopus,Journal of Media Psychology,"Breuer J., Scharkow M., Quandt T.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Type-Specific Screen Time Associations With Cardiovascular Risk Markers In Children,"Background: There is evidence that TV time may have stronger associations with cardiovascular risk markers than other types of screen time, but most studies focus on TV, or total screen time. Purpose: To examine associations between types of screen time and cardiovascular risk markers in school-age children. Methods: Cross-sectional study of 2515 school children in Portugal (aged 2-12 years, data collected in 2009 and 2010). Three types of screen time (TV, electronic games, and PC time) were collected through a questionnaire, and data on three cardiovascular risk markers (resting heart rate; diastolic blood pressure [DBP]; and systolic blood pressure [SBP]) were collected by a trained fieldworker. Complex-samples generalized linear models were run for each combination of screen time predictor and cardiovascular risk outcome, and a clustered cardiovascular risk score, adjusting for potential confounders (including physical activity). Analyses were conducted in 2011 and 2012. Results: TV viewing, but not PC or electronic games time, was associated positively with clustered cardiovascular risk score, DBP, and SBP after adjustment for all covariates. Watching TV for >2 hours/day (compared to <1 hour/day) was associated with higher DBP (coefficient, logged and back-transformed 0.02, 95% CI=0.00, 0.04, linear trend p=0.003); SBP (logged and back-transformed 0.02, 95% CI= -0.01, 0.05, p=0.009), and clustered cardiovascular risk score (0.13, 95% CI=0.02, 0.24, p<0.001). Conclusions: TV viewing, but no other type of screen time, was associated positively with cardiovascular risk markers independently of physical activity. Studies using a single marker of screen time or sedentary behavior may conceal screen time type-specific associations. © 2013 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.",doi,10.1016/j.amepre.2013.01.020,Scopus,American Journal of Preventive Medicine,"Stamatakis E., Coombs N., Jago R., Gama A., Mourão I., Nogueira H., Rosado V., Padez C.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Ultradian Rhythmicity And Induced Changes In Salivary Testosterone,"Testosterone and cortisol respond to exercise stimuli and modulate adaptation. Episodic basal secretion of these hormones may modify the responsiveness of these hormones. We sought to identify episodic steroid secretion via frequent salivary sampling and investigate any interaction between ultradian rhythmicity and induced changes in testosterone. Salivary testosterone and cortisol concentrations of seven males (age 20-40 years) were measured every 10 min between 0800 and1600 h on three consecutive days. On either the second or third day, three interventions designed to elicit a hormonal response were randomly assigned: sprint exercise (two 30-s maximal efforts on a cycle ergometer); boxing (two 30-s maximal punching efforts); and a violent video game (10 min of player vs. player combat). On the other days subjects were inactive. Testosterone data on non-intervention days suggested pulsatile secretion with a pulse interval of 47 ± 9 min (mean ± SD). The sprint intervention substantially affected hormones: it elicited a small transient elevation in testosterone (by a factor of 1.21; factor 90% confidence limits ×/÷1.21) 10 min after exercise, and a moderate elevation in cortisol peaking 50 min post-exercise (factor 2.3; ×/÷2.6). The testosterone response correlated with the change in testosterone concentration in the 10 min prior to the sprint (r = 0.78; 90% CL 0.22-0.95) and with a measure of randomness in testosterone fluctuations (r = 0.83; 0.35-0.96). Thus, the salivary testosterone response to exercise may be dependent on the underlying ultradian rhythm and aspects of its regulation. This interaction may have important implications for adaptation to exercise. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",doi,10.1007/s00421-010-1518-3,Scopus,European Journal of Applied Physiology,"Beaven C.M., Ingram J.R., Gill N.D., Hopkins W.G.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Usarsim: Simulation For The Study Of Human-Robot Interaction,"The PackBots being used by the U.S. military in Afghanistan and the urban search and rescue (USAR) robots that worked the World Trade Center site are just two recent examples of mobile robots moving from the laboratory to the field. What is significant about these new applications is that they invariably involve some form of human-robot interaction (HRI) rather than the full robot autonomy that has motivated most prior research. Conducting HRI research can be extremely difficult because experimentation with physical robots is expensive and time consuming. Few roboticists have experience or interest in conducting human experimentation, and researchers in human factors or human-computer interaction often lack experience in programming robots or access to robotic platforms. In this paper, we describe a high-fidelity, open-source simulation intended for HRI researchers of varying backgrounds and provide reference tasks and environments to facilitate collaboration in order to share the results. The architecture and capabilities of the game engine–based USARSim simulation are described. Its use for HRI research is illustrated through case studies describing experiments in camera control for remote viewing and integrated display of attitude information. © 2007, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.

,Use Of A Distracting Task To Obtain Defensive Head Movements To Looming Visual Stimuli By Human Adults In A Laboratory Setting.,"Defensive responses to looming visual stimuli have been obtained in a wide variety of species, including human infants as young as one week. This phenomenon has not, however, been formally demonstrated for adults under laboratory conditions. In this paper it is reported that similar responses, namely avoidance movements of the head, can be obtained in most human adults provided that they are suitably distracted by playing a computer tracking game. Such behaviours were not obtained when subjects were not so distracted. The use of control conditions also ruled out the possibility that simple movement cues from stimuli presented on a noncollision trajectory are sufficient stimulus to obtain defensive responses. It is of interest to note that latencies for avoidance movements were significantly shorter than those for orienting movements in the same situation, but were no different from the latencies for orienting movements when subjects were not distracted. It is argued that these findings are consistent with the proposition that defensive head movements to looming stimuli, like orienting movements to novel peripheral stimuli, represent a basic visual competence that is normally suppressed (or subsumed) by higher competences. The decision to avoid is probably based on the computation of time to contact, and may reflect the operation of a subcortical system for elementary analysis of optic flow.",doi,10.1068/p210245,Scopus,Perception,"King S.M., Dykeman C., Redgrave P., Dean P.",1992,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,"Use Of Computer-Assisted Technologies (Cat) To Enhance Social, Communicative, And Language Development In Children With Autism Spectrum Disorders","Major advances in multimedia computer technology over the past decades have made sophisticated computer games readily available to the public. This, combined with the observation that most children, including those with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), show an affinity to computers, has led researchers to recognize the potential of computer technology as an effective and efficient tool in research and treatment. This paper reviews the use of computer-assisted technology (CAT), excluding strictly internet-based approaches, to enhance social, communicative, and language development in individuals with ASD by dividing the vast literature into four main areas: language, emotion recognition, theory of mind, and social skills. Although many studies illustrate the tremendous promise of CAT to enhance skills of individuals with ASD, most lack rigorous, scientific assessment of efficacy relative to non-CAT approaches. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",doi,10.1007/s10803-012-1571-3,Scopus,Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders,"Ploog B.O., Scharf A., Nelson D., Brooks P.J.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Use Of Information And Communication Technology (Ict) And Perceived Health In Adolescence: The Role Of Sleeping Habits And Waking-Time Tiredness,"The first aim for this paper was to examine gender and age differences in the intensity of usage of information and communication technology (ICT: computer for digital playing, writing and e-mailing and communication, and Internet surfing, and mobile phone). Second, we modelled the possible mediating role of sleeping habits and waking-time tiredness in the association between ICT usage and perceived health (health complaints, musculoskeletal symptoms, health status). The participants were 7292 Finns aged 12, 14, 16 and 18 years responding to a postal enquiry (response rate 70%). The results showed that boys played digital games and used Internet more often than girls, whose mobile phone usage was more intensive. Structural equation model analyses substantiated the mediating hypothesis: intensive ICT-usage was associated with poor perceived health particularly or only when it negatively affected sleeping habits, which in turn was associated with increased waking-time tiredness. The associations were gender-specific especially among older adolescents (16- and 18-year olds). Intensive computer usage forms a risk for boys', and intensive mobile phone usage for girls' perceived health through the mediating links. Girls were vulnerable to the negative consequences of intensive mobile phone usage, as it associated with perceived health complaints and musculoskeletal symptoms both directly and through deteriorated sleep and increased waking-time tiredness. The results of gender-specific ICT usage and vulnerability are discussed as reflecting gendered psychophysiological, psychological and social developmental demands. © 2006 The Association for Professionals in Services for Adolescents.",doi,10.1016/j.adolescence.2006.07.004,Scopus,Journal of Adolescence,"Punamäki R.-L., Wallenius M., Nygård C.-H., Saarni L., Rimpelä A.",2007,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,User-Centred Design And Usability Evaluation Of A Heart Rate Variability Biofeedback Game,"Reduced heart rate variability (HRV) is an indicator of a malfunctioning autonomic nervous system. Resonant frequency breathing is a potential non-invasive means of intervention for improving the balance of the autonomic nervous system and increasing HRV. However, such breathing exercises are regarded as boring and monotonous tasks. The use of gaming elements (gamification) or a full gaming experience is a well-recognised method for achieving higher motivation and engagement in various tasks. However, there is limited documented knowledge on how to design a game for breathing exercises. In particular, the influence of additional interactive elements on the main course of training has not yet been explored. In this paper, we evaluated the satisfaction levels achieved using different game elements and how disruptive they were to the main task, i.e., paced breathing training. An Android flight game was developed with three game modes that differ in the degrees of multitasking they require. Design, development, and evaluation were conducted using a user-centred approach, including context analysis, the design of game principle mock-ups, the selection of game principles through a survey, the design of the game mechanics and GUI mock-up, and icon testing, and the performance of a summative study through user questionnaires and interviews. A summative evaluation of the developed game was performed with 11 healthy participants (ages 40-67) in a controlled setting. The results confirm the potential of video games for motivating players to engage in HRV biofeedback training. The highest training performance on the first try was achieved through pure visualisation rather than in a multitasking mode. Players had higher motivation to play the more challenging game and were more interested in long-term engagement. A framework for gamified HRV biofeedback research is presented. It has been shown that multitasking has considerable influence on HRV biofeedback and should be used with an adaptive challenge level. © 2013 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2601882,Scopus,IEEE Access,"Wollmann T., Abtahi F., Eghdam A., Seoane F., Lindecrantz K., Haag M., Koch S.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Using Biofeedback While Immersed In A Stressful Videogame Increases The Effectiveness Of Stress Management Skills In Soldiers,"This study assessed the efficacy of using visual and auditory biofeedback while immersed in a tridimensional videogame to practice a stress management skill (tactical breathing). All 41 participants were soldiers who had previously received basic stress management training and first aid training in combat. On the first day, they received a 15-minute refresher briefing and were randomly assigned to either: (a) no additional stress management training (SMT) for three days, or (b) 30-minute sessions (one per day for three days) of biofeedback-assisted SMT while immersed in a horror/first-person shooter game. The training was performed in a dark and enclosed environment using a 50-inch television with active stereoscopic display and loudspeakers. On the last day, all participants underwent a live simulated ambush with an improvised explosive device, where they had to provide first aid to a wounded soldier. Stress levels were measured with salivary cortisol collected when waking-up, before and after the live simulation. Stress was also measured with heart rate at baseline, during an apprehension phase, and during the live simulation. Repeated-measure ANOVAs and ANCOVAs confirmed that practicing SMT was effective in reducing stress. Results are discussed in terms of the advantages of the proposed program for military personnel and the need to practice SMT. © 2012 Bouchard et al.",doi,10.1371/journal.pone.0036169,Scopus,PLoS ONE,"Bouchard S., Bernier F., Boivin E., Morin B., Robillard G.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Using Biometric Measurement In Real-Time As A Sympathetic System In Computer Games,"With the increasing potential for gaming hardware and peripherals to support biometrics, their application within the games industry for software and design should be considered. This paper assesses the ability to use a form of biometric measurement, heart rate, in real-time to improve the challenge and enjoyment of a game by catering it to individuals of varying ability. While the findings of this study are valuable to game developers interested in providing additional dimensions to gameplay and testing, they may also be useful for those researching medical or therapeutic applications for games. The results suggest that although the tested game was inherently challenging and enjoyable, the adaptive affective gameplay was not altering the game enough to induce strong physiological or emotional responses from participants. Biofeedback games lend themselves to medical applications, but adaptive affective games can be used to respond sympathetically to the player without requiring direct control of physiological responses as a form of input. © 2013, IGI Global.",doi,10.4018/ijgbl.2013070103,Scopus,International Journal of Game-Based Learning,"Charij S., Oikonomou A.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Using Heart Rate To Detect High-Intensity Efforts During Professional Soccer Competition,"The goal of this article is to detect, describe, and compare 2 heart rate (HR) conditions associated with highintensity efforts but somewhat different in nature: The first one is indicated by HR values close to the maximum heart reserve (MHRR), and the second is indicated by a marked increase in the HR values (MIHR). It was expected that both conditions were associated with different game situations. A sample of 441 game situations (241 MIHRs and 200 MHRRs), taken from HR records and individual filming of 12 elite soccer players, was assessed along 7 preseason competition matches. The game situations in which each of these 441 HR conditions took place were identified, using a previously established taxonomy of a combination of field formats and category systems in the Match Vision Studio Premium. For the recording of the HR condition, an HRM Polar was attached to the players when in competition, together with a simultaneous filming of their performance during the game. The HRM and video recordings were synchronized beforehand to be able to relate the game situation in the film with HR conditions. The results showed significant differences between both HR conditions for 4 criteria of game situations (Ball in play, Game Center, Role, and Opposition). In all the cases, the MIHR is more associated with active participation of the players in the game, whereas the MHRR is more associated with the end of this participation. Thus, the results suggest that MIHR could be a useful complementary measurement to assess the intensity of physiological load that elite soccer players bear during competition, together with more traditional measurements such as MHRR. © 2012 National Strength and Conditioning Association.",doi,10.1519/JSC.0b013e31823b8739,Scopus,Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research,"Garcia O.G., Boubeta A.R., Deus E.R.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Verification Of Games In The Game Description Language,"The Game Description Language (GDL) is a special purpose declarative language for defining games. GDL is used in the AAAI General Game Playing Competition, which tests the ability of computer programs to play games in general, rather than just the ability to play a specific game. Participants in the competition are provided with a previously unknown game specified in GDL, and are required to dynamically and autonomously determine how best to play this game. Recently, there has been much interest in the use of strategic cooperation logics for reasoning about game-like scenarios - the Alternating-time Temporal Logic (ATL) of Alur, Henzinger, and Kupferman is perhaps the best known example. Such logics are specifically intended to support reasoning about game-theoretic properties of multi-agent systems. In short, the aim of this article is to make a concrete link between ATL and GDL, with the ultimate goal of using ATL to reason about GDL-specified games. We make the following contributions. First, we demonstrate that GDL can be understood as a specification language for ATL models, and prove that the problem of interpreting ATL formulae over propositional GDL descriptions is EXPTIME-complete. Second, we use ATL to characterize a class of 'fair playability' conditions, which might or might not hold of various games.",doi,10.1093/logcom/exp039,Scopus,Journal of Logic and Computation,"Ruan J., Van Der Hoek W., Wooldridge M.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,"Video-Mediated And Co-Present Gameplay: Effects Of Mutual Gaze On Game Experience, Expressiveness And Perceived Social Presence","We study how pairs of children interact socially and express their emotions while playing games in different communicative settings. In particular, we study how such interactions can vary for environments that differ regarding the level of mediation and the associated feelings of social presence. Overall, the study compared three conditions (one face-to-face gameplay condition, and two video-mediated gameplay conditions; one allowing for mutual gaze, the other not) and focused on the social presence and non-verbal behavior of children in three conditions. The results show that the presence of mutual eye-gaze enriches the feelings of social presence, fun and game experience; conversely, the absence of mutual eye-gaze dramatically effects the quality of interaction in the video-mediated environment. The results of this study stress the importance of mutual gaze, and we therefore argue that it should become an integral component of future VMC systems, particularly in those designed for playful settings and children. © 2012 British Informatics Society Limited.

,"Video Game Addiction: Cognitive, Emotional, And Behavioral Determinants For Cbt Treatment [Addiction Aux Jeux Vidéo : Déterminants Cognitifs, Émotionnels Et Comportementaux Pour Une Tcc]","During the last decade, the literature concerning Video Game Addiction (VGA) has grown strongly. Several studies deal with motivational aspects of VGA. However, there is a lack of qualitative studies allowing us to describe various emotions, cognitions and behaviors related to video game playing in this type of research. The purpose of the present research is to operationalize emotions, cognitions and behaviors proposed in a previous study with a protocol that permits to address VGA in a panel of various video game players. For this purpose, the Assessment of Cognitions, Emotions, and Behaviors Involved in Gaming (ACEBIG) was created. The findings were discussed in the context of a CBT intervention for VGA. Excessive Gamers (EG) presented more negative emotions and negative physical manifestations. The excitement and expectations about excitement were higher in EG group. EG presented more expectations about self-worth. When losing, self-devaluation and coping strategies dealing with negative emotions was highlighted. This research emphasizes the importance of cognitive avoidance of reality and immersion into the game. EG reported more expectations about social relationships through the game and more challenge related to other players. Interesting findings concerned behaviors (e.g., preparatory behaviors for improving gaming experience). The results of this research provide evidences that VGA is close to addictive behaviors and lead to some clinical implications. © 2017 Association Française de Therapie Comportementale et Cognitive",doi,10.1016/j.jtcc.2017.06.005,Scopus,Journal de Therapie Comportementale et Cognitive,"Taquet P., Romo L., Cottencin O., Ortiz D., Hautekeete M.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Video Game Playing And Its Relations With Aggressive And Prosocial Behavior.,"In this study of 278 children from the seventh and eighth grade of five elementary schools in Enschede, The Netherlands, the relationship between the amount of time children spent on playing video games and aggressive as well as prosocial behaviour was investigated. In addition, the relationship between the preference for aggressive video games and aggressive and prosocial behaviour was studied. No significant relationship was found between video game use in general and aggressive behaviour, but a significant negative relationship with prosocial behaviour was supported. However, separate analyses for boys and girls did not reveal this relationship. More consistent results were found for the preference for aggressive video games: children, especially boys, who preferred aggressive video games were more aggressive and showed less prosocial behaviour than those with a low preference for these games. Further analyses showed that children who preferred playing aggressive video games tended to be less intelligent.",doi,10.1111/j.2044-8309.1998.tb01177.x,anderson2010,British Journal of Social Psychology,"Wiegman, O., van Schie, E.

,Video Game Playing Is Independently Associated With Blood Pressure And Lipids In Overweight And Obese Adolescents,"Objective: To examine the association between duration and type of screen time (TV, video games, computer time) and blood pressure (BP) and lipids in overweight and obese adolescents. Design: This is a cross-sectional study of 282 overweight or obese adolescents aged 14-18 years (86 males, 196 females) assessed at baseline prior to beginning a lifestyle intervention study for weight control. Sedentary behaviours, defined as hours per day spent watching TV, playing video games, recreational computer use and total screen time were measured by self-report. We examined the associations between sedentary behaviours and BP and lipids using multiple linear regression. Results: Seated video gaming was the only sedentary behaviour associated with elevated BP and lipids before and after adjustment for age, sex, pubertal stage, parental education, body mass index (BMI), caloric intake, percent intake in dietary fat, physical activity (PA) duration, and PA intensity. Specifically, video gaming remained positively associated with systolic BP (adjusted r = 0.13, β = 1.1, p<0.05) and total cholesterol/HDL ratio (adjusted r = 0.12, β = 0.14, p<0.05). Conclusions: Playing video games was the only form of sedentary behaviour that was independently associated with increased BP and lipids. Our findings provide support for reducing time spent playing seated video games as a possible means to promote health and prevent the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in this high risk group of overweight and obese adolescents. Future research is needed to first replicate these findings and subsequently aim to elucidate the mechanisms linking seated video gaming and elevated BP and lipids in this high risk population.

,Video Gaming And Children’s Psychosocial Wellbeing: A Longitudinal Study,"The effects of video games on children’s psychosocial development remain the focus of debate. At two timepoints, 1 year apart, 194 children (7.27–11.43 years old; male = 98) reported their gaming frequency, and their tendencies to play violent video games, and to game (a) cooperatively and (b) competitively; likewise, parents reported their children’s psychosocial health. Gaming at time one was associated with increases in emotion problems. Violent gaming was not associated with psychosocial changes. Cooperative gaming was not associated with changes in prosocial behavior. Finally, competitive gaming was associated with decreases in prosocial behavior, but only among children who played video games with high frequency. Thus, gaming frequency was related to increases in internalizing but not externalizing, attention, or peer problems, violent gaming was not associated with increases in externalizing problems, and for children playing approximately 8 h or more per week, frequent competitive gaming may be a risk factor for decreasing prosocial behavior. We argue that replication is needed and that future research should better distinguish between different forms of gaming for more nuanced and generalizable insight. © 2017, The Author(s).",doi,10.1007/s10964-017-0646-z,Scopus,Journal of Youth and Adolescence,"Lobel A., Engels R.C.M.E., Stone L.L., Burk W.J., Granic I.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali

,Violence And Cardiovascular Health: A Systematic Review,"Context: Violence, experienced in either childhood or adulthood, has been associated with physical health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease. However, the consistency of the existing literature has not been evaluated. Evidence acquisition: In 2013, the authors conducted a PubMed and Web of Science review of peer-reviewed articles published prior to August 2013 on the relation between violence exposure, experienced in either childhood or adulthood, and cardiovascular outcomes. To meet inclusion criteria, articles had to present estimates for the relation between violence exposure and cardiovascular outcomes (e.g., hypertension, blood pressure, stroke, coronary disease, or myocardial infarction) adjusted for demographic factors. Articles focusing on violence from television, video games, natural disasters, terrorism, or war were excluded. Evidence synthesis: The initial search yielded 2,273 articles; after removing duplicates and applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 30 articles were selected for review. A consistent positive relation was noted on the association between violence experienced during childhood and cardiovascular outcomes in adulthood (i.e., hypertension, coronary heart disease, and myocardial infarction). Associations across genders with varying types of violence exposure were also noted. By contrast, findings were mixed on the relation between adult violence exposure and cardiovascular outcome. Conclusions: Despite varying definitions of violence exposure and cardiovascular endpoints, a consistent relation exists between childhood violence exposure, largely assessed retrospectively, and cardiovascular endpoints. Findings are mixed for the adult violence - cardiovascular health relation. The cross-sectional nature of most adult studies and the reliance of self-reported outcomes can potentially be attributed to the lack of fi ndings among adult violence exposure studies. © 2015 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.",doi,10.1016/j.amepre.2014.09.013,Scopus,American Journal of Preventive Medicine,"Suglia S.F., Sapra K.J., Koenen K.C.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Violent Content Enhances Video Game Performance,"This study assesses the impact of violent video game content on players' game performance. According to the desensitization hypothesis (Carnagey, Anderson, & Bushman, 2007), violent content may elicit negative affective responses and inhibitions, which in turn should interfere with performance. On the other hand, the players might understand virtual violent acts as a digital form of rough-and-tumble play, associated with positive emotions and mobilization, which in turn should raise performance. To test these competing hypotheses on game performance, N= 50 males with no prior violent gaming experience were exposed to three different versions of a custom-made video game in which the actions to be performed were identical, though they were audio-visually presented to appear either nonviolent, moderately, or extremely violent. The results show no indication of an initial inhibition of aggressive behavior, that is, performance is elevated and remains so if the action is presented audio-visually as being violent. This supports the notion that being involved in violent video game activity is perceived as an essentially harmless acting-out of playful fighting behavior. © 2009 Hogrefe Publishing.",doi,10.1027/1864-1105.21.4.145,Scopus,Journal of Media Psychology,Bösche W.,2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali

,"Violent Video Game Effects On Aggression, Empathy, And Prosocial Behavior In Eastern And Western Countries: A Meta-Analytic Review","Meta-analytic procedures were used to test the effects of violent video games on aggressive behavior, aggressive cognition, aggressive affect, physiological arousal, empathy/desensitization, and prosocial behavior. Unique features of this meta-analytic review include (a) more restrictive methodological quality inclusion criteria than in past meta-analyses; (b) cross-cultural comparisons; (c) longitudinal studies for all outcomes except physiological arousal; (d) conservative statistical controls; (e) multiple moderator analyses; and (f) sensitivity analyses. Social-cognitive models and cultural differences between Japan and Western countries were used to generate theory-based predictions. Meta-analyses yielded significant effects for all 6 outcome variables. The pattern of results for different outcomes and research designs (experimental, cross-sectional, longitudinal) fit theoretical predictions well. The evidence strongly suggests that exposure to violent video games is a causal risk factor for increased aggressive behavior, aggressive cognition, and aggressive affect and for decreased empathy and prosocial behavior. Moderator analyses revealed significant research design effects, weak evidence of cultural differences in susceptibility and type of measurement effects, and no evidence of sex differences in susceptibility. Results of various sensitivity analyses revealed these effects to be robust, with little evidence of selection (publication) bias. © 2010 American Psychological Association.",doi,10.1037/a0018251,Scopus,Psychological Bulletin,"Anderson C.A., Shibuya A., Ihori N., Swing E.L., Bushman B.J., Sakamoto A., Rothstein H.R., Saleem M.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,"Violent Video Game Effects On Salivary Cortisol, Arousal, And Aggressive Thoughts In Children","An experiment investigated the effects of violent content in video games on two physiological indicators of the fight-or-flight response (cortisol and cardiovascular changes) and on accessibility of aggressive thoughts in children. Participants played a randomly assigned violent or nonviolent video game, rated the game on several dimensions, and did a word completion task. Results showed that the violent video game increased cortisol and (for boys) cardiovascular arousal (relative to baseline) more than did the equally exciting nonviolent game. The violent game also increased the accessibility of aggressive thoughts. The cortisol findings in particular suggest that playing a violent video game may activate the sympathetic nervous system and elicit a fight-or-flight type response in children. Theoretical implications and future research are discussed. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",doi,10.1016/j.chb.2016.12.045,Scopus,Computers in Human Behavior,"Gentile D.A., Bender P.K., Anderson C.A.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Violent Video Games And Aggression: Causal Relationship Or Byproduct Of Family Violence And Intrinsic Violence Motivation?,"Two studies examined the relationship between exposure to violent video games and aggression or violence in the laboratory and in real life. Study 1 participants were either randomized or allowed to choose to play a violent or nonviolent game. Although males were more aggressive than females, neither randomized exposure to violent-video-game conditions nor previous real-life exposure to violent video games caused any differences in aggression. Study 2 examined correlations between trait aggression, violent criminal acts, and exposure to both violent games and family violence. Results indicated that trait aggression, family violence, and male gender were predictive of violent crime, but exposure to violent games was not. Structural equation modeling suggested that family violence and innate aggression as predictors of violent crime were a better fit to the data than was exposure to video game violence. These results question the common belief that violent-video-game exposure causes violent acts.",doi,10.1177/0093854807311719,anderson2010,Criminal Justice and Behavior,"Ferguson, C. J., Rueda, S.

,Violent Video Games As Exemplary Teachers: A Conceptual Analysis.,"This article presents conceptual and empirical analyses of several of the “best practices” of learning and instruction, and demonstrates how violent video games use them effectively to motivate learners to persevere in acquiring and mastering a number of skills, to navigate through complex problems and changing environments, and to experiment with different identities until success is achieved. These educational principles allow for the generation of several testable hypotheses, two of which are tested with samples of 430 elementary school children (mean age 10 years), 607 young adolescents (mean age 14 years), and 1,441 older adolescents (mean age 19 years). Participants were surveyed about their video game habits and their aggressive cognitions and behaviors. The first hypothesis is based on the principle that curricula that teach the same underlying concepts across contexts should have the highest transfer. Therefore, students who play multiple violent video games should be more likely to learn aggressive cognitions and behaviors than those who play fewer. The second hypothesis is based on the principle that long-term learning is improved the more practice is distributed across time. Therefore, students who play violent video games more frequently across time should be more likely to learn aggressive cognitions and behaviors than those who play the same types of games for equivalent amounts of time but less frequently. Both hypotheses were supported. We conclude by describing what educators can learn from the successful instructional and curriculum design features of video games.",doi,10.1007/s10964-007-9206-2,anderson2010,Journal of Youth and Adolescence,"Gentile, D.

,Violent Video Games Stress People Out And Make Them More Aggressive,"It is well known that violent video games increase aggression, and that stress increases aggression. Many violent video games can be stressful because enemies are trying to kill players. The present study investigates whether violent games increase aggression by inducing stress in players. Stress was measured using cardiac coherence, defined as the synchronization of the rhythm of breathing to the rhythm of the heart. We predicted that cardiac coherence would mediate the link between exposure to violent video games and subsequent aggression. Specifically, we predicted that playing a violent video game would decrease cardiac coherence, and that cardiac coherence, in turn, would correlate negatively with aggression. Participants (N = 77) played a violent or nonviolent video game for 20 min. Cardiac coherence was measured before and during game play. After game play, participants had the opportunity to blast a confederate with loud noise through headphones during a reaction time task. The intensity and duration of noise blasts given to the confederate was used to measure aggression. As expected, violent video game players had lower cardiac coherence levels and higher aggression levels than did nonviolent game players. Cardiac coherence, in turn, was negatively related to aggression. This research offers another possible reason why violent games can increase aggression-by inducing stress. Cardiac coherence can be a useful tool to measure stress induced by violent video games. Cardiac coherence has several desirable methodological features as well: it is noninvasive, stable against environmental disturbances, relatively inexpensive, not subject to demand characteristics, and easy to use. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",doi,10.1002/ab.21454,Scopus,Aggressive Behavior,"Hasan Y., Bègue L., Bushman B.J.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Vision-Based Robotic Motion Control For Non-Autonomous Environment,"A visual servo control system with SOPC structure is implemented on a retrofitted Mitsubishi Movemaster RV-M2 robotic system. The hardware circuit has the functions of quadrature encoder decoding, limit switch detecting, pulse width modulation (PWM) generating and CMOS image signal capturing. The software embedded in Nios II micro processor has the functions of using UART to communicate with PC, robotic inverse kinematics calculation, robotic motion control schemes, digital image processing and gobang game AI algorithms. The digital hardware circuits are designed by using Verilog language, and programs in Nios II micro processor are coded with C language. An Altera Statrix II EP2S60F672C5Es FPGA chip is adopted as the main CPU of the development board. A CMOS color image sensor with 356 ×292 pixels resolution is selected to catch the environment time-varying change for robotic vision-based servo control. The system performance is evaluated by experimental tests. A gobang game is planned to reveal the visual servo robotic motion control objective in non-autonomous environment. Here, a model-free intelligent self-organizing fuzzy control strategy is employed to design the robotic joint controller. A vision based trajectory planning algorithm is designed to calculate the desired angular positions or trajectory on-line of each robotic joint. The experimental results show that this visual servo control robot has reliable control actions. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",doi,10.1007/s10846-008-9286-6,Scopus,Journal of Intelligent and Robotic Systems: Theory and Applications,"Huang S.-J., Wu S.-S.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Voice Quality Conversion Using Interactive Evolution Of Prosodic Control,"Recent years have seen the birth of new markets using voice quality conversion technology for a variety of application fields including man-personal machine interfaces, addition of narration in multimedia-content editing, and computer games. Optimal parameters for voice quality conversion, however, are speaker dependent, and consequently, no clear-cut algorithm has existed in the past and parameter adjustment has usually been performed by an experienced designer on a trial and error basis. This paper proposes the application of evolutionary computation, a stochastic search technique based on organic evolution, to parameter adjustment for voice conversion, and reports on several experimental results applicable to the fitting of prosodic coefficients. Evolutionary computation is said to be ""applicable to even cases where the properties of the target function are not well known,"" and we decided to apply it considering that this feature might be effective in our study. Providing an explicit evaluative function for evolutionary computation, however, is difficult, and we here adopt an interactive-evolution system in which genetic manipulation is performed repeatedly while evaluating results based on human emotions. Evaluation experiments were performed on raw human speech recorded by a microphone and speech mechanically synthesized from text. It was found that the application of evolutionary computation could achieve voice conversion satisfying specific targets with relatively little degradation of sound quality and no impression of artificial processing in comparison to parameter adjustment based on designer experience or trial and error. This paper also shows that prosodic conversion coefficients determined by the interactive evolution technique, while exhibiting speaker dependency, is not text dependent. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

,"Web Addiction In The Brain: Cortical Oscillations, Autonomic Activity, And Behavioral Measures","Background and aims: Internet addiction (IA) was recently defined as a disorder tagging both the impulse control and the reward systems. Specifically, inhibitory deficits and reward bias were considered highly relevant in IA. This research aims to examine the electrophysiological correlates and autonomic activity [skin conductance response (SCR) and heart rate] in two groups of young subjects (N = 25), with high or low IA profile [tested by the Internet Addiction Test (IAT)], with specific reference to gambling behavior. Methods: Oscillatory brain activity (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma) and autonomic and behavioral measures [response times (RTs) and error rates (ERs)] were acquired during the performance of a Go/NoGo task in response to high-rewarding (online gambling videos and video games) or neutral stimuli. Results: A better performance (reduced ERs and reduced RTs) was revealed for high IAT in the case of NoGo trials representing rewarding cues (inhibitory control condition), probably due to a ""gain effect"" induced by the rewarding condition. In addition, we also observed for NoGo trials related to gambling and video games stimuli that (a) increased low-frequency band (delta and theta) and SCR and (b) a specific lateralization effect (more left-side activity) delta and theta in high IAT. Discussion: Both inhibitory control deficits and reward bias effect were considered to explain IA. © 2017 The Author(s).",doi,10.1556/2006.6.2017.041,Scopus,Journal of Behavioral Addictions,"Balconi M., Campanella S., Finocchiaro R.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,"What Do We Really Know About First-Person-Shooter Games? An Event-Related, High-Resolution Content Analysis","Multiple studies have been addressing effects of playing violent video games. However, most such studies neglect users' individual experiences. In fact, each player's gameplaying choices creates his or her own specific game content. Within this study we analyzed the individually generated content of a typical first-person-shooter game with high temporal resolution and associated them with physiological response measures (heart rate, skin conductance) collected during the game play. Thirteen experienced game players played the multiplayer first-person-shooter game ""Tactical Ops: Assault on Terror"" for 50 minutes on average.

,When You Don't Quite Get What You Want: Psychological And Interpersonal Consequences Of Claiming Inclusion,"People's success or failure to gain inclusion in groups may result from their own actions or the actions of others. Two studies compared the personal and interpersonal consequences of inclusion and exclusion when they resulted from these two processes. People's own failure to ""claim"" inclusion in a computerized ballgame was equally detrimental for fundamental needs and made people equally unlikely to behave prosocially to group members, as being denied inclusion by others. In contrast, the beneficial effects of inclusion depended on the process with which it was obtained, and meta-perceptions of warmth mediated these differences; people who succeeded to claim inclusion thought their interaction partners liked them less than people who were granted inclusion, and as a result, their fundamental needs were satisfied less, and they behaved less prosocially. © 2012 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.",doi,10.1177/0146167212450463,Scopus,Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin,"de Waal-Andrews W., van Beest I.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Wide-Range Robust Control Of Combustion Instability,"This paper presents the concept and design of a two-layer robust control system for suppression of combustion instabilities over a wide range of operation. The control law is synthesized based on a multiple-time-scale model of combustion dynamics. Control actions on the fast-time scale are provided by secondary fuel injection, and are gain-scheduled according to the variations of mean-flow temperature and velocity on the slow-time scale. A linear parameter varying (LPV) L2-gain control law is formulated in the setting of differential game theory. Simulation experiments have been conducted to evaluate the control law under wide-range operation of a generic combustor in terms of the trade-off among: (1) fuel injection rate and pressure oscillation; (2) transient and steady responses; and (3) stability robustness and performance. © 2002 The Combustion Institute.",doi,10.1016/S0010-2180(01)00349-2,Scopus,Combustion and Flame,"Hong B.-S., Ray A., Yang V.",2002,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,"""Treasure Hunt"" - A Cognitive-Behavioural Computer Game [""Schatzsuche""- Ein Verhaltenstherapeutisches Computerspiel]","The development of video games promoting health related behaviour is increasing. This holds not only for chronic diseases like asthma and diabetes, but also for the field of child psychotherapy. At the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry of Zürich University, the video game Treasure Hunt was developed to support psychotherapeutic treatment of children between eight and thirteen years of age. Treasure Hunt does not replace the therapist but supports treatment by offering attractive electronic work assignments. The scope of this article is an overview on health games for children and a description of Treasure Hunt. After the explanation of its therapeutic potentials, an evaluation based on questionnaires for therapists and children will be presented. 124 therapists answered a questionnaire on their impression of the game three months after download. 41 therapists were willing to participate in the further evaluation and sent questionnaires of 200 children with whom Treasure Hunt had been used. A limitation of these data is that a positive bias can not be excluded, as therapists with a positive attitude towards psychotherapeutic computer games were more likely to answer the questionnaire. 118 therapists (95.2%) considered Treasure Hunt a useful tool in child psychotherapy. 197 children (98.5%) report being satisfied with the use of the game during treatment. Treasure Hunt was predominantly used for the age group it is designed for and both, by very experienced and by young therapists.

This study was a cross-sectional survey, and data was collected through self-report questionnaires. Data was analyzed using the SPSS program. In logistic regression analysis, the risk of being addicted to internet games was 2.22 times higher in males than females. Adolescents with low and middle academic performance also had a higher risk(2.08 times and 2.54 times) to become addicted to internet games. For the location of the computer, the risk of becoming addicted to internet games were .01 times lower in the living room or brother or sisters' room than in their own room. The risk of becoming addicted to internet games was 1.18 times higher in the higher usage time of internet games. The risk of becoming addicted to internet games was .49 times lower in the more accepting and autonomic parents' rearing attitude and .02 times lower in the high self-efficacy group than the low group.

,[Hormone And Metabolism Behavior In Distress Without Physical Stress].,"The psychological effects on cortisol, human growth hormone (HGH), free fatty acids and lactate were investigated in 10 healthy students using a one hour television game. To insure that only the psychological aspects of the game were being measured, hematocrit, creatininkinase, CK-MB and myoglobin were used as controls. The game began 60 minutes after venapuncture of a lower arm vein with an indwelling catheter. Blood samples were taken 30 and 60 minutes after venapuncture, at intervals of 20 minutes during the game and 30, 60 and 120 minutes after the end of the game. After an initial rise, plasma cortisol levels sank steadily and significantly (alpha = 1%). The HGH level initially fell, but as the game progressed, rose and remained at a high level for a considerable period after the game had ended. These variations however were not statistically significant. The three free fatty acids under investigations, myristinic acid (C14), palmitic acid (C16), and stearic acid (C18), all showed similar levels over the course of the experiment. During the first 20 minutes of the play, free fatty acid levels rose, with stearic acid levels rising the most (52%). The free fatty acid levels then sank as the game progressed, with the palmitinic acid level showing a significant decline (alpha = 1%). The other parameters remained relatively constant during the experiment, with the exception of the CK-MB level, which showed severe, hard-to-interpret variations.",pmid,3984537,pubmed,Zeitschrift fur Psychosomatische Medizin und Psychoanalyse,"Abdulla, W; Ludes, H; Frey, R",1985,NA,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Ace And Blood Pressure Status Influences Cardiovascular Responses To Challenge,"The influence of race and blood pressure status on cardiovascular responses to three challenges (interview, video game and cold pressor) was investigated in 50 healthy normotensive and 30 unmedicated mild-to-moderate hypertensive black and white men, aged 25-44 years old. Group differences were obtained for two tasks. The interview evoked race and blood pressure status differences: higher heart rate responses were elicited from normotensives compared with hypertensives and larger diastolic blood pressure (DBP) responses were elicited from whites compared with blacks. For the video game, black hypertensives displayed larger DBP responses than white hypertensives and greater systolic blood pressure and DBP responses than black normotensives. The video game heart rate response of white normotensives exceeded that of black normotensives and white hypertensives. These findings suggest that cardiovascular responses to challenge are affected by race and blood pressure status. The blood pressure hyperresponsiveness of black hypertensives compared with black normotensives to a psychological challenge (video game) provides generality to previous research conducted only on whites. © Current Science Ltd.",pmid,1851788,Scopus,Journal of Hypertension,"Saab P.G., Tischenkel N., Spitzer S.B., Gellman M.D., Decarlo Pasin R., Schneiderman N.",1991,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Activity Profiles And Demands Of Seasonal And Tournament Basketball Competition,"Competition-specific conditioning for tournament basketball games is challenging, as the demands of tournament formats are not well characterized. Purpose: To compare the physical, physiological, and tactical demands of seasonal and tournament basketball competition and determine the pattern of changes within an international tournament. Methods: Eight elite junior male basketball players (age 17.8 ± 0.2 y, height 1.93 ± 0.07 m, mass 85 ± 3 kg; mean ± SD) were monitored in 6 seasonal games played over 4 mo in an Australian second-division national league and in 7 games of an international under-18 tournament played over 8 days. Movement patterns and tactical elements were coded from video and heart rates recorded by telemetry. Results: The frequency of running, sprinting, and shuffling movements in seasonal games was higher than in tournament games by 8-15% (99% confidence limits ± ~8%). Within the tournament, jogging and low- to medium-intensity shuffling decreased by 15-20% (± ∼14%) over the 7 games, while running, sprinting, and high-intensity shuffling increased 11-81% (± ∼25%). There were unclear differences in mean and peak heart rates. The total number of possessions was higher in seasonal than in tournament games by 8% (± 10%). Conclusions: Coaches should consider a stronger emphasis on strength and power training in their conditioning programs to account for the higher activity of seasonal games. For tournament competition, strategies that build a sufficient aerobic capacity and neuromuscular resilience to maintain high-intensity movements need to be employed. A focus on half-court tactics accounts for the lower number of possessions in tournaments. © 2013 Human Kinetics, Inc.",pmid,23479394,Scopus,International Journal of Sports Physiology and Performance,"Klusemann M.J., Pyne D.B., Hopkins W.G., Drinkwater E.J.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali

The second study used a combined ABAB withdrawal and repeated measures analysis of variance design that incorporated baseline and intervention assessments within a single session. In both studies, video game-playing resulted in significantly less nausea. The introduction and withdrawal of the opportunity to play video games produced significant changes (reduction and exacerbation, respectively) in nausea.

,Combining Computer Game-Based Behavioural Experiments With High-Density Eeg And Infrared Gaze Tracking.,"Experimental paradigms are valuable insofar as the timing and other parameters of their stimuli are well specified and controlled, and insofar as they yield data relevant to the cognitive processing that occurs under ecologically valid conditions. These two goals often are at odds, since well controlled stimuli often are too repetitive to sustain subjects' motivation. Studies employing electroencephalography (EEG) are often especially sensitive to this dilemma between ecological validity and experimental control: attaining sufficient signal-to-noise in physiological averages demands large numbers of repeated trials within lengthy recording sessions, limiting the subject pool to individuals with the ability and patience to perform a set task over and over again. This constraint severely limits researchers' ability to investigate younger populations as well as clinical populations associated with heightened anxiety or attentional abnormalities. Even adult, non-clinical subjects may not be able to achieve their typical levels of performance or cognitive engagement: an unmotivated subject for whom an experimental task is little more than a chore is not the same, behaviourally, cognitively, or neurally, as a subject who is intrinsically motivated and engaged with the task. A growing body of literature demonstrates that embedding experiments within video games may provide a way between the horns of this dilemma between experimental control and ecological validity. The narrative of a game provides a more realistic context in which tasks occur, enhancing their ecological validity (Chaytor & Schmitter-Edgecombe, 2003). Moreover, this context provides motivation to complete tasks. In our game, subjects perform various missions to collect resources, fend off pirates, intercept communications or facilitate diplomatic relations. In so doing, they also perform an array of cognitive tasks, including a Posner attention-shifting paradigm (Posner, 1980), a go/no-go test of motor inhibition, a psychophysical motion coherence threshold task, the Embedded Figures Test (Witkin, 1950, 1954) and a theory-of-mind (Wimmer & Perner, 1983) task. The game software automatically registers game stimuli and subjects' actions and responses in a log file, and sends event codes to synchronise with physiological data recorders. Thus the game can be combined with physiological measures such as EEG or fMRI, and with moment-to-moment tracking of gaze. Gaze tracking can verify subjects' compliance with behavioural tasks (e.g. fixation) and overt attention to experimental stimuli, and also physiological arousal as reflected in pupil dilation (Bradley et al., 2008). At great enough sampling frequencies, gaze tracking may also help assess covert attention as reflected in microsaccades - eye movements that are too small to foveate a new object, but are as rapid in onset and have the same relationship between angular distance and peak velocity as do saccades that traverse greater distances. The distribution of directions of microsaccades correlates with the (otherwise) covert direction of attention (Hafed & Clark, 2002).",pmid,21206465,Scopus,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,"Yoder K.J., Belmonte M.K.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali

,Development And Evaluation Of Low Cost Game-Based Balance Rehabilitation Tool Using The Microsoft Kinect Sensor.,"The use of the commercial video games as rehabilitation tools, such as the Nintendo WiiFit, has recently gained much interest in the physical therapy arena. Motion tracking controllers such as the Nintendo Wiimote are not sensitive enough to accurately measure performance in all components of balance. Additionally, users can figure out how to ""cheat"" inaccurate trackers by performing minimal movement (e.g. wrist twisting a Wiimote instead of a full arm swing). Physical rehabilitation requires accurate and appropriate tracking and feedback of performance. To this end, we are developing applications that leverage recent advances in commercial video game technology to provide full-body control of animated virtual characters. A key component of our approach is the use of newly available low cost depth sensing camera technology that provides markerless full-body tracking on a conventional PC. The aim of this research was to develop and assess an interactive game-based rehabilitation tool for balance training of adults with neurological injury.",pmid,22254685,Scopus,Conference proceedings : ...

,Does Virtual Reality-Based Kinect Dance Training Paradigm Improve Autonomic Nervous System Modulation In Individuals With Chronic Stroke?,"Physical inactivity and low resting heart rate variability (HRV) are associated with an increased cardiovascular deconditioning, risk of secondary stroke and mortality. Aerobic dance is a multidimensional physical activity and recent research supports its application as a valid alternative cardiovascular training. Furthermore, technological advances have facilitated the emergence of new approaches for exercise training holding promise, especially those methods that integrate rehabilitation with virtual gaming. The purpose of this study was to evaluate cardiac autonomic modulation in individuals with chronic stroke post-training using a virtual reality - based aerobic dance training paradigm. Eleven community-dwelling individuals with hemiparetic stroke [61.7( ± 4.3) years] received a virtual reality-based dance paradigm for 6 weeks using the commercially available Kinect dance video game ""Just Dance 3."" The training was delivered in a high-intensity tapering method with the first two weeks consisting of 5 sessions/week, next two weeks of 3 sessions/week and last two weeks of 2 sessions/week, with a total of 20 sessions. Data obtained for HRV analysis pre- and post-intervention consists of HRV for ten minutes in (1) supine resting position; (2) quiet standing. High-frequency (HF) power measures as indicators of cardiac parasympathetic activity, low-frequency (LF) power of parasympathetic-sympathetic balance and LF/HF of sympatho-vagal balance were calculated. YMCA submaximal cycle Ergometer test was used to acquire VO2 max pre- and post-intervention. Changes in physical activity during dance training were assessed using Omran HJ-321 Tri-Axis Pedometer. After training, participants demonstrated a significant improvement in autonomic modulation in the supine position, indicating an improvement in LF=48.4 ( ± 20.1) to 40.3 ( ± 8.0), p=0.03; HF=51.5 ( ± 19) to 59.7 ( ± 8), p= 0.02 and LF/HF=1.6 ( ± 1.9) to 0.8 ( ± 0.26), p=0.05]. Post-training the participants had significantly higher VO2max. Number of steps during dance intervention significantly increased from the 1st to the 20th session (p<0.05). The current study is the first to assess the effect of a virtual reality-based aerobic dance training paradigm on HRV among individuals with chronic stroke. Given that the paradigm used in this study improves cardiac autonomic control, future studies should incorporate dance as an adjuvant therapy into clinical treatment program and assess its long-term efficacy.",pmid,27829967,pubmed,Journal of vascular and interventional neurology,"Sampaio, Luciana Maria Malosá; Subramaniam, Savitha; Arena, Ross; Bhatt, Tanvi",2017,NA,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Effect Of Court Dimensions On Players' External And Internal Load During Small-Sided Handball Games.,"The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of three different court dimensions on the internal and external load during small-sided handball games. Six male amateur handball players took part in this study and participated in three different 8-min 3vs3 (plus goalkeepers) small-sided handball games (each repeated twice). The three court dimensions were 12×24m, 30×15m and 32×16m. Through Global Positioning System devices (SPI pro elite 15Hz, GPSports) and video analysis, the following parameters were recorded: cyclic and acyclic movements (distance covered and number of technical actions executed), heart rate, and rating of perceived exertion (RPE). Total distance travelled increased with court dimensions (885.2m ± 66.6m in 24×12m; 980.0m ± 73.4m in 30×15m; 1095.0m ± 112.9m in 32×16m, p < 0.05). The analysis of distance covered in the four speed zones (0-1.4 m·s(-1); 1.4-3.4 m·s(-1); 3.4-5.2 m·s(-1); >5.2 m·s(-1)) highlighted substantial differences: playing with the 30×15m court in comparison to the 24×12m, the players covered less distance in the first speed zone (p = 0.012; ES = 0.70) and more distance in the second (p = 0.049; ES = 0.73) and third (p = 0.012; ES = 0.51) speed zones. Statistical differences were also found between the 24×12m and 32×16m courts: the players covered more distance in the second and third speed zones (p = 0.013, ES = 0.76; p = 0.023 ES = 0.69) with the 32×16m court in comparison to the 24×12m. There was no significant effect of court dimensions on the technical parameters (number of team actions, passes, piston movements toward goal and defensive activities), the number of specific handball jumps and changes of direction, and the time spent in the different heart rate zones. Considering the average data of all the experimental conditions together (24×12m, 30×15m, 32×16m), a pronounced statistical difference was highlighted between the values in first two HR zones and the last two (p < 0.05; large ES). The rating of perceived exertion was significantly higher during the drill with the 32×16m court compared with the 24×12m one (p < 0.05; ES = 2.34). Our findings indicate that changing court dimensions during small-sided handball games can be used to manipulate both external and internal loads on the players. Key pointsTo cover the specific game demands, more specific training methodologies have been developed in many sport games.Specific game exercises may provide a useful conditioning stimulus, together with technical and tactical training components.Changing court dimensions during small-sided handball games can be used to manipulate both external and internal loads on the players.The high ratio of cyclic activity per minute and the high HR values recorded during SSHGs make this type of drills extremely useful for aerobic power training.",pmid,24790482,pubmed,Journal of sports science &amp; medicine,"Corvino, Matteo; Tessitore, Antonio; Minganti, Carlo; Sibila, Marko",2014,NA,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Effect Of Screen-Based Media On Energy Expenditure And Heart Rate In 9- To 12-Year-Old Children,"This study compared the cardiovascular responses and energy costs of new and traditional screen based entertainments, as played by twenty 9- to 12-year-old children. Playing traditional electronic games resulted in little change to heart rate or energy expenditure compared with watching a DVD. In contrast, playing an active-input game resulted in a 59% increase in heart rate (p &lt; .001) and a 224% increase in energy expenditure (p &lt; .001) for boys and girls. The average heart rate of 130 bpm and energy expenditure of 0.13 kcal · min-1 · kg-1 achieved during active-input game use equates with moderate intensity activities such as basketball and jogging. Active-input electronic games might provide children with opportunities to engage with technology and be physically active at the same time. © 2007 Human Kinetics, Inc.",pmid,18089912,Scopus,Pediatric Exercise Science,"Straker L., Abbott R.",2007,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,"Effects Of Violent Video Games On Aggressive Behavior, Aggressive Cognition, Aggressive Affect, Physiological Arousal, And Prosocial Behavior: A Meta-Analytic Review Of The Scientific Literature",Research on exposure to television and movie violence suggests that playing violent video games will increase aggressive behavior. A metaanalytic review of the video-game research literature reveals that violent video games increase aggressive behavior in children and young adults. Experimental and nonexperimental studies with males and females in laboratory and field settings support this conclusion. Analyses also reveal that exposure to violent video games increases physiological arousal and aggression-related thoughts and feelings.

,Impact Of A Serious Game For Health On Chronic Disease Self-Management: Preliminary Efficacy Among Community Dwelling Adults With Hypertension,"Most Americans will acquire a chronic disease during their lifetime. One of the most prevalent chronic diseases that affect Americans is hypertension (HTN). Despite the known comorbidities and increased mortality rate associated with uncontrolled HTN, most community dwelling adults with HTN do not have sufficient blood pressure control. Therefore, the aim of this article is to report the preliminary efficacy of a serious game for health to enhance blood pressure control among community dwelling adults with HTN. A nonprobability sample of 116 community dwelling adults with HTN participated in this nonblinded, randomized controlled trial. Participants were randomly assigned to: (1) an intervention arm that consisted of four exposures to a serious game for health known as eSMART-HD; or (2) an attentional control arm that compromised of four exposures to screen-based HTN education. The primary outcome measure for this trial was blood pressure reduction over a four month observational period. In this study, baseline characteristics and blood pressure measurements were similar between participants in each study arm. There was no significant between-group difference in blood pressure reduction over time. However, there were significant within-group reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressures across time among favoring participants exposed to eSMART-HD. This study establishes the preliminary efficacy of eSMART-HD that can be easily administered to community dwelling adults and facilitate clinically significant reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Future studies should assess the influential components of this promising serious game for health (eSMART-HD) combined with medication management in larger and more diverse samples of community dwelling adults with HTN. © 2015, Southern Public Administration Education Foundation, Inc.

,Inverse Relationship Of Urinary Cyclic Gmp To Blood Pressure Reactivity In The Cardia Study: Vasodilatory Regulation Of Sympathetic Vasoconstriction,"Objective: To determine whether urinary cyclic GMP (cGMP), which mediates the actions of the vasodilators nitric oxide and atrial natriuretic factor, is inversely related to blood pressure (BP) reactivity. In previous work, we found that urinary cGMP was inversely related to diastolic BP, but cGMP levels were higher among individuals presumed to have increased adrenergic activity, increased reactivity, and increased risk of hypertension (blacks, individuals with a family history of hypertension). Method: We measured 24-hour urinary cGMP levels in a substudy of 529 individuals in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study; the sample was 23 to 35 years of age and approximately balanced for race (black/white) and gender. BP reactivity to stressors (video game, star-tracing, cold pressor) was tested 3 years earlier. Baseline BP was included as a covariate in all analyses. Results: Diastolic BP reactivity to cold pressor was inversely related to cGMP excretion (p < .05); the relationship was strongest among black women with a family history of hypertension (partial r = -.33, p < .01). Systolic BP reactivity to star-tracing was also inversely related to cGMP (p < .01); the relationship for both star-tracing and video game stressors was strongest among black men (partial r values = -.25 and -.24, respectively; p values < .01). Conclusions: The results indicate that vasodilatory activity may impact the BP response to stress through modulation of adrenergic activation, particularly among blacks.",pmid,9625219,Scopus,Psychosomatic Medicine,"Markovitz J.H., Tucker D., Lewis C.E., Sanders P.W., Warnock D.G.",1998,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Is The Wii Ft Free Run Activity A Feasible Mode Of Exercise For Regular Exercisers: A Comparison With Treadmill Running,"Background: This study compared the metabolic responses between treadmill running and the free run on the nintendo Wii when maintaining a constant pace with an aim to see whether this would be a feasible option for exercise in persons who already exercise. METHODS: Twenty eight university students, mean age 20.7±1.38 years, participated in a repeated measures study. Subjects completed 10 minutes running on the treadmill at a self selected pace followed by 10 minutes of Free Run on the Nintendo Wii Fit disc. A metronome regulated the running pace during the Free Run activity to match the running pace on the treadmill. Oxygen consumption, caloric expenditure and heart rate were measured with a Cardio Coach Metabolic Cart. Paired t-tests compared the percentage of age predicted maximal oxygen consumption (% Vo2max), metabolic equivalents (MeTs), caloric expenditure and percentage of estimated maximal heart rate (% hrmax) between the two running situations. RESULTS: For all variables of interest the mean values for treadmill running was found to be signifcantly higher than those for the Wii Free Run (P<0.001). The mean %HRmax and MeTs categorized both activities as vigorous intensity, however, the free run was at the lower end of the ranges whilst treadmill running was at the upper. The mean %VO2max classifed treadmill running as vigorous intensity and Wii Free Run as moderate. concluSionS: The Wii free run activity can be used as an additional form of exercise for persons who are already engaged in physical activity but should not be considered a replacement for treadmill running by those who run. © 2016 Edizioni Minerva Medica.",pmid,26223006,Scopus,Journal of Sports Medicine and Physical Fitness,"Roopchand-Martin S., Nelson G.A.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali

The lacrosse ball is a solid rubber ball of approximately 20 cm in diameter and the fastest shot recorded in professional lacrosse is over 100 mph. Despite wearing full protection, the neck remains prone to blunt trauma by this ball. A 23-year man sustained a direct blow to his left neck by a lacrosse ball during play, resulting in immediate aphonia and stridor. CT scan confirmed a left thyroid lamina fracture. The patient was treated conservatively and his airway was monitored for 24 hours. He made a full recovery.

,Laterality Of Brain Activation For Risk Factors Of Addiction,"Background: Laterality of brain activation is reported for tests of risk factors of addiction - impulsivity and craving - but authors rarely address the potential significance of those asymmetries. Objective: The purpose of this study is to demonstrate this laterality and discuss its relevance to cognitive and neurophysiological asymmetries associated with drug abuse vulnerability in order to provide new insights for future research in drug abuse. Method: From published reports, brain areas of activation for two tests of response inhibition or craving for drugs of abuse were compiled from fMRI activation peaks and were tabulated for eight sections (octants) in each hemisphere. Percent asymmetries were calculated (R-L/R+L) across studies for each area. Results: For impulsivity, most activation peaks favored the right hemisphere. Overall, the percent difference was 32% (Χ2 = 16.026; p &lt; 0.0001) with the greater asymmetry for anterior peaks (46.8%; Χ2 = 17.329; p &lt; 0.0001). The asymmetries for cue-induced craving were opposite, favoring the left hemisphere by 6.7% (Χ2 = 4.028; p &lt; 0.05). The consistency of left asymmetry was found for almost all drugs. For nicotine, studies where subjects were not allowed to smoke (deprived) prior to measurement had the same left hemisphere activation but those who smoked (satiated) before the fMRI measure showed right asymmetry. Conclusion: Brain activation studies demonstrate different left/right hemispheric contributions for impulsivity versus craving - factors related to addiction. Failure to take laterality into consideration is a missed opportunity in designing studies and gaining insight into the etiology of drug abuse and pathways for treatment. © 2016 Bentham Science Publishers.",pmid,26674074,Scopus,Current Drug Abuse Reviews,Gordon H.W.,2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Long-Term Hand Tele-Rehabilitation On The Playstation 3: Benefits And Challenges.,"Rehabilitation interventions for the hand have shown benefits for children with Hemiplegia due to cerebral palsy or traumatic brain injury. Longer interventions are facilitated if training is provided in the patient's home, due to easier access to care and reduced impact on school or work activities. Providing remote rehabilitation over lengthy periods of time has however its own challenges. This paper presents two pediatric patients with hemiplegia, who practiced virtual hand rehabilitation games using a modified PlayStation 3 and 5DT sensing gloves. Despite severe initial hand spasticity, and occasional technology shortcomings, the subjects practiced for about 14 months, and 6 months, respectively. Game performance data for the second patient is presented. Follow-up evaluations 14 months from the removal of the PlayStation 3 from the home of the child with cerebral palsy showed that the patient had good retention in terms of grasp strength, hand function and bone health. Challenges of long-term home tele-rehabilitation are also discussed.",pmid,22254686,Scopus,Conference proceedings : ...

,Longitudinal Association Of Cardiovascular Reactivity And Blood Pressure In Samoan Adolescents,"Objective: The longitudinal association between blood pressure (BP) reactivity to a video game and resting BP 3 to 4 years later was investigated in 83 Samoan adolescent from American and (Western) Samoa as part of a multidisciplinary study of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in modern Samoans. Methods: Participants ranged in age from 11 to 14 years at baseline, in 1992 to 1993, and 14 to 18 years at follow-up in 1996. Video game BP reactivity was defined as the residual score of the regression of the maximum BP during the video game on the minimum resting BP before the video game. The predictive effect of baseline video game BP reactivity on follow-up resting BP was tested using regression models with baseline resting BP, baseline body mass index (BMI), and age as covariates. Results: Systolic BP reactivity to the video game at baseline was significantly, p = .04, and independently associated with resting systolic BP 3 to 4 years later. Samoan adolescent who had higher systolic BP reactivity scores at baseline had significantly higher resting systolic BP at follow-up after adjustment for the significant effects of baseline resting systolic BP, age, and BMI. There were no interactions between sex and reactivity or between residence, American Samoa or (Western) Samoa, and reactivity in the models, indicating that the effects of systolic BP reactivity in early adolescence on later adolescent resting systolic BP were similar in the entire study sample. Conclusions: Video game cardiovascular reactivity seems to assess aspects of psychophysiological arousal and prospective CVD risk in Samoan adolescent of both sexes residing in both Samoas, and may be useful for understanding the role of psychosocial stress and health in modernizing societies.",pmid,10204978,Scopus,Psychosomatic Medicine,"Newman J.D., Mcgarvey S.T., Steele M.S.",1999,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Multidimensional Performance Characteristics In Talented Male Youth Volleyball Players,"The purpose of this study was to determine whether anthropometric, physical, psychological, and skill test results could be used to discriminate between male junior volleyball players of varying ability. A total of 66 elite and nonelite male Estonian volleyball players aged 16-17 years were measured for anthropometric and physical variables and sport-specific skills. In addition, the players' provided self-reports of dispositional achievement goals, perceived sport competence and enjoyment and their game intelligence was measured. Selected youth players scored better than nonselected youth players on physical (explosive strength), technical (passing and spiking), and cognitive (game intelligence) characteristics and reported higher mastery-approach goals, perceived sport competence and enjoyment of sport. The most discriminating variables were game intelligence, mastery approach goals, perceived sport competence and passing technique. These results suggest the important role of multidimensional performance measures in selecting and developing young male volleyball players. Structured talent identification and development programs have been developed for several sports, in particular athletics, rowing, gymnastics, field hockey and soccer, where success has been related to anthropometric, physiological and motor skill attributes (3,25,34,46). According to Williams and Reilly (50), research should adopt a multidisciplinary approach to talent identification. Recently, Vaeyens et al. (46) suggested that when researchers will concentrate on a combination of anthropometric, physical, and physiological measures, their predictive value has proven problematic in the majority of team sports. For example, Gabbett and coworkers demonstrated that subjective coach evaluation of passing and serving technique, but not physiological and anthropometric data, discriminate between successful and unsuccessful talent-identified junior volleyball players (20). In addition, an increasing number of researchers have argued that potentially important psychological variables are often overlooked within talent identifcation models (1,34,46). Research suggests that successful elite athletes posses a range of psychological characteristics including the ability to cope with anxiety and obstacles, selfconfdence, competitiveness, intrinsic motivation, and the ability to set and achieve goals (22,40). Termed ""Psychological Characteristics of Developing Excellence"", or PCDEs, these factors allowed aspiring elites to optimize development opportunities, adapt to setbacks and effectively negotiate key transitions encountered along the pathway to excellence (29). However, relatively little scientific evidence has been accumulated thus far as to which skills are required at different stages, for different activities, or even idiosyncratically for different individuals. Motivation is a construct that underpins much of the literature on personal characteristics of talent identification and numerous authors have attested to its important role in the development of sport expertise (1,12,13,34). According to achievement goal theory, it is assumed that people judge their competence and define successful accomplishment via at last two different goal perspectives-task and ego goals (32). People who are strongly task oriented tend to demonstrate their competence in a self-referenced manner and focus on realizing personal improvement, task-mastery and learning. Individuals who have a strong ego orientation have a tendency to want to demonstrate high competence relative to other people (38). Recently, the valence dimension of competence has been integrated into the achievement goal literature to create a 2 × 2 achievement goal framework (15). The 2 × 2 achievement goal framework comprises four distinct achievement goals: mastery-approach, mastery-avoidance, performance-approach, and performance-avoidance. In the limited studies that have been done in sport contexts, mastery-approach goals have been found to be positively linked to the belief that sport competence can be developed ant competence valuation, and negatively related to state anxiety and motivation (7,9). Performance-approach goals have been found to correlate positively with the belief that one' s level of sport competence is fixed, perceptions of performance climate, and competence valuation and negatively link to state anxiety. Performance-avoidance and mastery-avoidance tend to correlate with a network of negative achievementrelated processes and outcomes, including state anxiety and amotivation (7,9). Further, perceived competence is considered to be a primary antecedent of goal adoption. High perceived competence is posited to orient individuals to the possibility of success, and to facilitate the adoption of approach goals. In contrast, low perceived competence is supposed to orient individuals to the possibility of failure to facilitate the adoption of avoidance goals (15). Enjoyment has been recognized as a key factor for motivated behavior and sustained involvement in youth sport (40,41,48). Enjoyment as ""a positive affective response to the sport experience that reflects generalized feelings such as pleasure, liking and fun"" (41, p. 6) is the theoretical defnition used in this study (10). Enjoyment is also a component of achievement goal theory (32) and an important outcome in its own right as young athletes who enjoy participating in their sport have more meaningful sport experience and more likely to continue participation (48). To solve a problem effectively in a sport-challenging context, the performer has to perceive the environment, anticipate the on-going activity, make a decision, and respond as quickly and as accurately as he or she is capable of doing (42). Game intelligence in team sports refects a player's ability to use cognitive processes (ability to read the game, having strong tactical awareness) during games when they have to execute a game plan against the other team (18). Therefore, by applying a multidimensional design of talent identifcation in ball games such as volleyball, the cognitive ability to solve tactical problems should be assessed in addition to motor, motivational and technical variables (18,42). The purpose of this study was to determine whether anthropometric, physical, psychological, and skill test results could be used to discriminate between male junior volleyball players of varying ability. Based on previous research (19,20,28), we expected that volleyball skills and explosive strength but not anthropometric characteristics would discriminate between junior volleyball players of different levels. With regard to psychological variables, we anticipated that youth national team players exhibited higher levels of game intelligence, mastery-and performance approach goals, perceived sport competence and enjoyment when compared with nonselected players. Method: Participants: Sixty-five junior volleyball players (mean age, 16.7 ± 0.7 years) participated in this study. An initial invitation to participate in the current study was sent to coaches of 5 volleyball clubs located in Tallinn and Tartu (Estonia). All five clubs agreed to participate and all male volleyball players aged 16-17 years were invited to participate. Participants were assigned into two groups according to playing level: selected-players on the U16 and U18 national youth team; and nonselected-players on regional teams. Measures: Anthropometric and Physical Characteristics: Anthropometry included the recording of stature, body mass and standing reach stature. Stature was measured using a Martin metal anthropometer (A&D Instruments Ltd, UK) to the nearest 0.1 cm and body mass was measured using calibrated digital scales to the nearest 0.1 kg. Standing reach stature was measured using a metal anthropometer. Players were requested to stand with feet flat on the ground, extend their arm and hand, and mark the standing reach stature. Upper-body muscular strength and endurance was evaluated using the 30-s sit-ups test from the EUROFIT test battery (17). The agility of players was evaluated using the Illinois agility run (39) and explosive power was measured using vertical jump test. Participants performed the jumping test on the mobile contact timing mat system (Newtest OY, Finland). Players were instructed to execute all vertical jumps with their hands on the hips to diminish upper body movement and standardize the movement pattern. The highest value obtained from three attempts was used. Volleyball Skills: Each player performed four volleyball skills (spiking, passing, setting and serving) in an indoor stadium. After a standardized warm-up players performed six attempts of each skill. Two video cameras (Sony, HDR-XR520VE), positioned approximately 5 m from the player, were used to film each skill. For spiking and setting skills, players were filmed from the side and front of the player. Players' accuracy was based on the ability to hit specific targets. The players' technique was subjectively evaluated from video footage by two expert coaches using standardized technical protocols (20). Psychological Testing: Dispositional achievement goals in sport were measured via the 12-item Achievement Goals Questionnaire for Sport (AGQ-S; 6). The AGQ-S was designed to tap athletes' ways to strive for demonstrating high competence or avoid demonstrating incompetence in the athletic domain. Study participants responded on a scale ranging from 1=""not at all like me"" to 7=""completely like me"".",pmid,22109779,Scopus,Pediatric Exercise Science,"Rikberg A., Raudsepp L.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,"Physiologic Responses, Liking And Motivation For Playing The Same Video Game On An Active Versus A Traditional, Non-Active Gaming System.","Evidence suggests that individuals playing certain video games on the Nintendo Wii® (Wii) exhibit increased energy expenditure versus traditional video games, although little research examines non-Wii Sports/Fit games. The purpose of this study is to assess physiologic responses, liking, and the relative reinforcing value (RRV) of a popular, non-Wii sports video game for the Wii relative to the same game played on a traditional, non-active system. Twenty-four college-aged students participated. Heart rate and oxygen consumption (V̇O2) was assessed during rest and when playing the following games: Madden NFL 2011® for Playstation 2 (PS2 Madden) and the Wii (Wii Madden), and Wii Sports Boxing. The RRV was assessed for Wii Madden versus PS2 Madden. Analysis of variance demonstrated a main effect for condition (p ≤ 0.01) as V̇O2 (5.2 ± 0.2 ml·kg-1·min-1 Wii, 4.1 ± 0.1 ml·kg-1·min-1 PS2, 3.7 ± 0.1 ml·kg-1·min-1, rest) and heart rate (89.2 · 2.7 bpm Wii, 79.7 ± 2.5 bpm PS2, 79.1 ± 2.5 bpm, rest) was greater for Wii Madden than PS2 Madden and rest. Heart Rate (105.4 ± 5.3 bpm) and V̇O2 (10.4 ml·kg-1·min-1) for Wii Sports Boxing was significantly greater than all other conditions (p ≤ 0.003). The RRV was not significantly different between Wii Madden and PS2 Madden (p = 0.50). Compared to the same game on a traditional system, Wii Madden is more physiologically challenging and equally reinforcing.

,The Design Of The M-Health Service Application Using A Nintendo Ds Game Console.,"In this article, we developed an m-health monitoring system using a Nintendo DS game console to demonstrate its utility. The proposed system consists of a biosignal acquisition device, wireless sensor network, base-station for signal reception from the sensor network and signal conversion according to Internet protocol, personal computer display program, and the Nintendo DS game console. The system collects three-channel electrocardiogram (ECG) signals for cardiac abnormality detection and three-axis accelerometer signals for fall detection of a person. The collected signals are then transmitted to the base-station through the wireless sensor network, where they are transformed according to the transmission control protocol/Internet protocol (TCP/IP) and sent to the destination IP through Internet network. To test the developed system, the collected signals were displayed on a computer located in different building through wired Internet network and also simultaneously displayed on the Nintendo DS game console connected to Internet network wirelessly. The system was able to collect and transmit signals for more than 24h without any interruptions or malfunctions, showing the possibility of integrating healthcare monitoring functions into a small handheld-type electronic device developed for different purposes without significant complications. It is expected that the system can be used in an ambulance, nursing home, or general hospital where efficient patient monitoring from long distance is necessary.",pmid,21214393,Scopus,Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,"Lee S., Kim J., Lee M.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,"The Physiological Cost And Enjoyment Of Wii Fit In Adolescents, Young Adults, And Older Adults","Background: Active video games (exergames) increase energy expenditure (EE) and physical activity (PA) compared with sedentary video gaming. The physiological cost and enjoyment of exergaming in adolescents, and young and older adults has not been documented, nor compared with aerobic exercise. This study compared the physiological cost and enjoyment of exergaming on Wii Fit with aerobic exercise in 3 populations. Methods: Cardiorespiratory and enjoyment measurements were compared in 14 adolescents, 15 young adults, and 13 older adults during handheld inactive video gaming, Wii Fit activities (yoga, muscle conditioning, balance, aerobics), and brisk treadmill walking and jogging. Results: For all groups EE and heart rate (HR) of Wii Fit activities were greater than handheld gaming (P < .001) but lower than treadmill exercise (P ≤ .001). Wii aerobics elicited moderate intensity activity in adolescents, young adults, and older adults with respective mean (SD) metabolic equivalents of 3.2 (0.7), 3.6 (0.8), and 3.2 (0.8). HR during Wii aerobics fell below the recommended intensity for maintaining cardiorespiratory fitness.

,"Using A Virtual Game System To Innovate Pulmonary Rehabilitation: Safety, Adherence And Enjoyment In Severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease","objective: The present pilot study tested the use of a virtual game system (VGS) for exercise training in patients with moderate to very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease undergoing pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). Safety, feasibility, enjoyment and adherence were assessed. Methods: VGS (Wii [2006], Nintendo, USA) games were prescreened and categorized into lower- and upper-body workouts. Patients admitted for a three- to four-week inpatient PR program exercised daily. They were provided an opportunity to individually engage in VGS sessions three times weekly, varying with length of stay. Dyspnea, oxygen saturation and heart rate were measured before, during and after game sessions. Patients were considered to be adherent if they attended at least 50% of VGS sessions. Adverse events and enjoyment were evaluated. Results: Thirty-two patients witha mean (± SD) age of 66±9 years and a mean forced expiratory volume in 1 s of 0.72±0.40 L participated. Among the 25 patients completing the program, adherence was 76%, with a mean attendance rate of 64±35%. Mean dyspnea score was 1.5±1.1 before and 3.2±1.2 after exercise. Mean oxygen saturation changed from 94±3% to 91±5% (P<0.001), while heart rate increased from 88±15 beats/min to 102±18 beats/min (P<0.001). One patient reported chest painrequiring nitroglycerin spray and five experienced transient desaturation below 85% with play. Patients enjoyed the program (visual analogue score 8±2.6/10) and most would highly recommend it to others. Conclusions: Moderate exercise using a VGS was safe, feasible and enjoyed as an adjunct to inpatient PR. This modality may encourage patients to maintain physical activity after PR. © 2013 Pulsus Group Inc.",pmid,24093115,Scopus,Canadian Respiratory Journal,"Wardini R., Dajczman E., Yang N., Baltzan M., Préfontaine D., Stathatos M., Marciano H., Watson S., Wolkove N.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Virtual Reality Immersion Method Of Distraction To Control Experimental Ischemic Pain,"Background: Virtual reality immersion has been advocated as a new effective adjunct to drugs for pain control. The attenuation of pain perception and unpleasantness has been attributed to the patient's attention being diverted from the real, external environment through immersion in a virtual environment transmitted by an interactive 3-D software computer program via a VR helmet. Objectives: To investigate w hether VR immersion can extend the amount of time subjects can tolerate ischemic tourniquet pain. Methods: The study group comprised 20 healthy adult volunteers. The pain was induced by an inflated blood pressure cuff during two separate, counterbalanced, randomized experimental conditions for each subject: One with VR and the control without VR exposure. The VR equipment consisted of a standard computer, a lightweight helmet and an interactive software game. Results: Tolerance time to ischemia was significantly longer for VR conditions than for those without (P < 0.001). Visual Analogue Scale (0-10) ratings were recorded for pain intensity, pain unpleasantness, and the time spent thinking about pain. Affective distress ratings of unpleasantness and of time spent thinking about pain were significantly lower during VR as compared with the control condition (P< 0.003 and 0.001 respectively). Conclusions: The VR method in pain control was shown to be beneficial. The relatively inexpensive equipment will facilitate the use of VR immersion in clinical situations. Future research is necessary to establish the optimal selection of clinical patients appropriate for VR pain therapy and the type of software required according to age, gender, personality, and cultural factors.",pmid,16671363,Scopus,Israel Medical Association Journal,"Magora F., Cohen S., Shochina M., Dayan E.",2006,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,A Review On Laser Spot Detection System Based On Image Processing Techniques,"Laser pointer is a low-cost daily essential item that can provide a prominent spot, deliver the meaning of a pointing gesture and accurately indicate a spot. Robust detection of a laser spot has been made possible with the help of the computer vision techniques. Autonomous laser spot detection system has led to the evolution of many applications such as laser pointer interaction, autonomous robotic helper and simulation based computer game. This paper aims to provide the general architecture and methodology used in a laser spot detection system. Major lower level processing methods, such as thresholding, background subtraction, region of interest extraction and coordinate mapping are fundamental in developing a good laser spot system. Our study found out that most of existing systems are prone to error whenever the lighting condition is varied either gradually or suddenly. The spot is also difficult to detect when it is overlaid on a white background due to the weakness in the detection scheme. Jitter, which is mostly caused by uneven hand movement, is a big challenge in developing an accurate system, especially for laser interaction applications. Finally, we believe that a robust laser spot detection system can be built if the aforementioned challenges are carefully addressed. © 2005 - 2014 JATIT & LLS.

,Advanced Reconfiguration Framework Based On Game Theoretical Techniques In Autonomic Communication Systems,"The Autonomic Communications concept forms one promising solution to accommodate the increased complexity of legacy and emerging systems, fostering the automation and minimizing the need for human intervention. This notion implies the introduction of advanced mechanisms for autonomic decision making and self-configuration. The focus of this work is on the introduction of an advanced reconfiguration framework for the support of the following functionalities: i) efficient strategies of terminal attachment to heterogeneous wireless systems are proposed dependent on the evaluation of input stimuli from the surrounding telecom environment. ii) it is shown how to enable optimized selection and attribution of resources, iii) the application of new device configuration is examined, proposing a framework for dynamic protocol stack adaptation. It is indeed necessary to introduce a framework that will enable, policy based reconfiguration decisions supporting dynamic and optimal discovery, download and replacement of necessary protocol functionality. In this context, legacy management and control mechanisms should be enriched with such features operating in either terminal or network equipment. Namely, this contribution discusses cognitive reconfiguration management issues by introducing two basic reconfiguration units encapsulated in a unified management and control architecture: i) the component based protocol stack reconfiguration framework and ii) the resource usage optimization unit. Simulation and performance results presented in the paper prove the technical feasibility of the proposed mechanisms as well as the optimization of reconfiguration actions.",eid,2-s2.0-36849061007,Scopus,Annales des Telecommunications/Annals of Telecommunications,"Patouni E., Gault S., Muck M., Alonistioti N., Kominaki K.",2007,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali

,Analyses Of Time-Motion And Heart Rate In Elite Female Players (U19) During Competitive Handball Matches [Notacijska Analiza I Frekvencija Srca Vrhunskih Rukometašica (U19) Zabilježena Tijekom Natjecateljskih Utakmica],"Heart rate and time-motion were examined in elite female handball players (U19) during six competitive matches. The average age of the participants was 17.9±0.3 years, the average mass was 65.4±6.9 kg, and the average height was 169.6±6.9 cm. Time-motion analyses of the players were performed using Video Manual Motion Tracker 1.0 software. The descriptive approach of the study determined the overall physical activity (distance [m]) and type of locomotion (standing, walking, jogging, medium-intensity running, high-intensity running, sprinting). The players' heart rates were monitored using TEAM Polar2Pro sport testers (Polar Electro, Kempele, Finland). The maximum heart rate was measured by means of the Yo-Yo intermittent level 1 (YYIRT1) recovery test. One-way ANOVA with repeated- measures was used to compare data on heart rate, covered distance and speed. Based on the results from the time-motion analysis, the average distance covered was 113.3±8.6 m per minute per match. The average distance the players covered during the matches was 3399±362.3 m. The shortest distance (385.8±371.6 m), was traversed by standing and walking, and the longest distance (935.8±165.5 m) by jogging. The players' average heart rate was 183.7±7.3 beats·min-1. The mean intensity during the matches represented 89.6±3.6% of the maximal heart rate (HRmax). The results of this study demonstrate that handball is a high-intensity intermittent sport. The physiological profile shows that the players spent more than 83% of the playing time per match in the high-intensity zone (&gt;85%HRmax). Based on this, training focused on anaerobic exercises and interval training methods is recommended. Anaerobic training ensures that players will be ready to carry out a high intensity performance and to maintain it during the whole match. Maintaining high intensity depends chiefly on the ability to replenish energy systems during the period spent in lower-intensity locomotion. We recommend working on the improvements in anaerobic and aerobic power during practice sessions.",eid,2-s2.0-84903757373,Scopus,Kinesiology,"Belka J., Hulka K., Safar M., Weisser R., Samcova A.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali

,Assessment Of Functional Capacity And Body Composition Of Overweight Children After An Aerobic Exercise Program Using The Nintendo Wii Console: A Pilot Study,"Background: Obesity is the fastest growing illness in the world and has increased at an alarming rate among children. Many researchers have sought strategies to reduce sedentary lifestyles among children and adolescents. Game therapy is one tool with the potential to promote physical activity, due to children’s appreciation of this type of activity. The aim of the present pilot study was to assess the effects of game therapy on the functional capacity and body composition of overweight children using a program of aerobic exercises on the Nintendo Wii console. Material/Methods: Four overweight children, aged between 7 and 10 years, participated in the study. After a physical and functional assessment, the children underwent 16 aerobic exercise sessions using a video game on the Nintendo Wii that involved running and martial arts. Results: At the end of the study, a reduction of body mass – from 46.62 (±5.15) kg to 45 (±4.97) kg – and BMI was recorded. Abdominal circumference also decreased from 81.62 (±6.57) cm to 79.87 (±6.55) cm and functional capacity improved. Conclusions: These results suggest that active video games can have a positive effect on the physiological and metabolic responses of participants, thereby affecting weight loss. This should be evaluated in a study with a larger sample size. © Med Sci Tech.",eid,2-s2.0-84979026001,Scopus,Medical Science Technology,"Carrasco A.C., Kerppers I.I., Teixeira A.B., Pires J.A.W.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Autonomous Learners In Digital Realms: Exploring Strategies For Effective Digital Language Learning,"The arrival of the Digital Age has been a 'white water change' (Oxford 2008c, 191), a metaphor describing the rapid, complex and allencompassing nature of this technological wave. The Digital Age has changed the characteristics of language learners themselves. With the pervasive influence of digital technology, most learners in economically developed countries are now either 'digital immigrants' or 'digital natives' (Prensky 2001; Carlson 2005). Digital natives are individuals who have been surrounded by digital technologies all their lives and who cannot easily imagine an existence without applications such as videogames, email, blogs, texting, cell phones, digital cameras and iPods. Digital immigrants are those individuals who grew up without digital technologies but who have become skilled in the use of some of them, albeit generally with 'accented' skills. The Digital Age has opened up a plethora of creative routes for digital language learning, which we define as any type of language learning supported in whole or in part by computer technologies. For instance, Second Life and other 'massively multiplayer online-roleplaying games' are increasingly used for language learning (Oxford 2008b, 2010). Wireless, Internet-connected mobile devices, such as MP3 or MP4 players, are among the most popular and most flexible technology aids at US government language institutes (Center for the Advanced Study of Language 2008), offering dual-channel (visual and auditory) learning, 'augmented realities,' the possibility of new virtual identities and instant connections with other learners (Dede 2005; Oxford 2010). Alelo's Tactical Iraqi offers authentic language and culture instruction delivered in game-like scenario formats to military and other learners, with accurate assessments of progress provided (Nielson, Rockwood and Robertson 2007). Individuals can now benefit from blogging and wikis for language learning (Oxford 2010). However, effectiveness in digital language learning does not magically occur. To be a successful digital language learner, an individual must use relevant language learning strategies. A language learning strategy is a deliberate, goal-oriented action plan that a learner employs to control, regulate, and enhance his or her language learning (Oxford 2011). Many research studies (see those reported in O'Malley and Chamot 1990; Oxford 1990, 1996; Cohen and Macaro 2007; Griffiths 2008) have shown that the use of certain types of learning strategies is related significantly to language proficiency. Appropriate learning strategies make language learning more efficient, more effective and often more enjoyable (Oxford 1990). Among the most salient categories of language learning strategies are cognitive strategies for analysing, synthesising and reasoning; metacognitive strategies for managing and controlling the learning cycle (planning, organising, monitoring and evaluating); and affective and social strategies for dealing with emotional, motivational and interpersonal sides of language learning. The next section presents some of the challenges of digital language learning and depicts the strategic ways by which language learners deal with them. © 2011 by The Hong Kong University Press, HKU.

,"Babes In Bonanzaland: Kid Nation, Commodification, And The Death Of Play","On the Web site for the CBS reality show Kid Nation (2007) the tagline reads: ""40 kids have 40 days to build a brave new world without adults to help or hinder their efforts."" The show takes place in a New Mexico ghost town called Bonanza City, where one can just imagine Lorne Green or Michael Landon lurking somewhere offscreen. The children are charged with creating this new world on their own, a heavy responsibility for a cast ranging in age from eight to fifteen. Aside from the obvious biblical reference to Noah and the Flood, the show offers visual nostalgia for the grand ol' days of a shoot-'em-up Wild West that must be tamed (minus, of course, outlaws or hostile Native Americans). According to Jyotsna Kapur, ""Children are invoked as mediums through which the past [glory and power] can be restored"" (87), and Kid Nation functions as a modern fusion of such ideological themes as civilization versus nature, individual strength against great odds, the glory of the Western frontier, and the innocence of childhood. The series alludes to such cultural artifacts as William Goldings's Lord of the Flies and John Ford westerns. The tagline on the Web site continues, ""Will they come together as a cohesive unit or will they succumb to the childhood temptations that lead to chaos?"" This question challenges broad cultural fantasies of an imagined Victorian-style childhood innocence. In our postmodern society, childhood is increasingly conceived of in nostalgic terms that infuse it with a desire for a ""perfect"" past that has not yet been created. In reality, the postmodern child's material and geographic condition is an increasingly multitextual space: urban, wired, materialist, graphic, and more adultlike; here nostalgia for a ""lost"" childhood works alongside a youth's desire for adult autonomy. Reinforcing that quest for an idealized childhood are the growing communities of ""cyber-real"" space (computer and video games, online communities, text messaging, Facebook, YouTube, and so on), which offer the promise of multiple satisfactions. The image of childhood, as commonly conceived, is being transformed as a result of the constant infusion of technology into daily life. Childhood has become ""staged for public consumption"" (Postman 82-83) to fit a nostalgic ideal of what childhood should be. Kid Nation is one, perhaps inevitable, move toward uniting the reality show with the adult quest for youth in this era of an increasing loss of ""childness."" As Postman argues, broad access to the information superhighway has allowed for a certain level of knowledge now available to children that, in an earlier time, would have been exclusive to adults (85). The line between adult and child in Kid Nation is blurred; it is situated between children's desire to be adult (adultifying) and adult desire to recapture youth. The series attempts to offer a fantasy to both groups. The reality show experience changes the discourse of childhood as a socially negotiated space by authenticating existing social structures in the series' myth of creating a brave new world. The series sets up the typical conflict dynamic between participants expected from a reality show within the coming-of-age frame. This site of mediation between childhood and adulthood in Kid Nation, as a display, requires a reexamination of common assumptions about what it means to be a child in the digital age. The sociopolitical structures implemented in Kid Nation severely restrict the children's ability to actually create the new society that the series promises; instead, childhood is displayed as a condition that must be overcome in the quest for increased productivity in Bonanza City. Kid Nation commodifies childhood and then systematically destroys it. In a paradoxical move, the rhetoric of recaptured youth (free from adults) instead offers the visual and emotional destruction of childhood while the viewer commiserates with the young people trapped within adult social matrices, much like rats in a maze: how will the children negotiate the assigned challenges of money, class, race, religion, prejudice - and their own state of childhood?.

,Cardiovascular Risk Factors And Health Behaviours In Elementary School-Age Inuvialuit And Gwich'in Children,"OBJECTIVES: To determine cardiovascular risk factors and health behaviours in Aboriginal children from the Beaufort-Delta region (Northwest Territories). METHODS: A total of 91 elementary school-age children underwent a cross-sectional assessment of body mass index, waist circumference, blood pressure and aerobic fitness. Healthy living knowledge and behaviours, including frequency of self-reported physical activity (PA) and dietary intake, were also evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 49.5% of children were obese/overweight and 31.9% had elevated blood pressure. The percentages having one, two or three cardiovascular risk factor(s) were 64.4%, 42.2% and 15.6%, respectively, with no significant difference between boys and girls. Overall, the students obtained higher mean scores in the areas of healthy PA, body image, self-esteem and nutritious beverage knowledge (89%, 85%, 79% and 71% of the maximum scores, respectively). The lowest scores were in nutritious food consumption and healthy PA frequency (46% and 56% of the maximum scores, respectively). On average, children consumed 2.7 L of sugar-sweetened beverages weekly and <2 servings of fruits or vegetables daily. Children spent approximately 2 h per day watching television, playing games or using a computer. CONCLUSION: There is an urgent need for community-based approaches to address the high rates of obesity and related cardiovascular risk factors among these Aboriginal children. Given the disconnect between healthy living knowledge and behaviour, it is important that future treatment programs address other barriers faced by Aboriginal populations living in rural and remote regions, including the high cost and limited access to high-quality nutritious foods and beverages, and limited access to indoor recreational programs over the long winter season. ©2014 Pulsus Group Inc.

,Central And Regional Circulatory Adjustments During Emotional Stress Before And After Combined Alpha And Beta-Receptor Blockade,"In order to study the hemodynamic and sympathetic effect of emotional stress provoked by the video-game and the modifications of this response caused by labetalol, a combined alpha- and beta-receptor blocking agent, five subjects (mean age 48 yr), two men and two women with essential hypertension and one normotensive man with coronary artery disease were examined. At rest and during pratice of the game, before and after intravenous administration of labetalol, .75 mg/kg b.w., the following variables were measured: heart rate, mean aortic blood pressure, cardiac output, splanchinic-hepatic blood flow and the arterial concentration of catecholamines. The game provoked an increase in heart rate of 30%, in aortic mean pressure of 23%, in cardiac output of 38% and in splanchnic-hepatic vascular resistance of 21%. During the game the arterial noradrenaline concentration was 0.756 ng/ml compared to 0.22 ng/ml at rest. The adrenaline concentration was 0.06 ng/ml at rest and not changed during the game. The alpha- and beta-receptor blockade reduced the response of all the circulatory variables measured, with exception of the increase in splanchnic-hepatic vascular resistance. The arterial noradrenaline concentration was higher at rest (0.36 ng/ml) and during the game (0.86 ng/ml). It is concluded that a game of this type, which the subjects find entertaining, causes a satisfactory circulatory response to be used for the study of the hemodynamic effects of emotional stress. In contrast to the acute effect of a beta-receptor blocker the combined alpha- and beta-receptor blocker, labetalol, causes a fall in mean arterial blood pressure and an increase in cardiac output at rest. During the game the blockade of the alpha-receptors probably prevented the exagerated increase in peripheral vasoconstriction normally seen after administration of a beta-receptor blocker.",eid,2-s2.0-0018237209,Scopus,Coeur et Medecine Interne,"Clausen J.P., Trap-Jensen J., Svendsen T.L.",1978,NA,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Changing Heartbeat Perception To Induce Anxiety In Virtual Environments,"In this paper, we first propose a general technique to induce anxiety in virtual environments (VEs) which exploits auditory heartbeat perception and biofeedback. Then, we consider a VE that reproduces a real-world anxietyinducing experience (being suddenly surrounded by smoke during a fire evacuation of a building), and we describe an experiment that contrasts 3 conditions: (i) an augmentation of the VE with a bar that indicates when the user’s avatar gets hurt, (ii) an augmentation of the VE with the typical audio visual stimuli which are employed in violent videogames when the user’s avatar gets hurt, (iii) introduction of the proposed biofeedback technique in the previous condition. We carry out an electrodermal analysis showing that the introduction of the proposed technique produces much higher physiological arousal in terms of skin conductance level (SCL) than the other two conditions. Subjective measures of users’ state anxiety are consistent with the recorded physiological reactions. © 2012 Interactive Media Institute.",eid,2-s2.0-85019569456,Scopus,Annual Review of CyberTherapy and Telemedicine,Chittaro L.,2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Co-Operative Strategy For An Interactive Robot Soccer System By Reinforcement Learning Method,"This paper presents a cooperation strategy between a human operator and autonomous robots for an interactive robot soccer game. The interactive robot soccer game has been developed to allow humans to join into the game dynamically and reinforce entertainment characteristics. In order to make these games more interesting, a cooperation strategy between humans and autonomous robots on a team is very important. Strategies can be pre-programmed or learned by robots themselves with learning or evolving algorithms. Since the robot soccer system is hard to model and its environment changes dynamically, it is very difficult to pre-program cooperation strategies between robot agents. Q-learning - one of the most representative reinforcement learning methods - is shown to be effective for solving problems dynamically without explicit knowledge of the system. Therefore, in our research, a Q-learning based learning method has been utilized. Prior to utilizing Q-learning, state variables describing the game situation and actions' sets of robots have been defined. After the learning process, the human operator could play the game more easily. To evaluate the usefulness of the proposed strategy, some simulations and games have been carried out.",eid,2-s2.0-4544289438,Scopus,"International Journal of Control, Automation and Systems","Kim H.-R., Hwang J.-H., Kwon D.-S.",2003,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Competitive Active Video Games: Physiological And Psychological Responses In Children And Adolescents,"BACKGROUND: Recent strategies to reduce sedentary behaviour in children include replacing sedentary screen time for active video games. Active video game studies have focused principally on the metabolic consumption of a single player, with physiological and psychological responses of opponent-based multiplayer games to be further evaluated. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether adding a competitive component to playing active video games impacts physiological and psychological responses in players. METHODS: Sixty-two healthy Caucasian children and adolescents, nine to 14 years years of age, completed three conditions (8 min each) in random order: treadmill walking, and single and opponent-based Kinect active video games. Affect, arousal, rate of perceived exertion, heart rate and percentage of heart rate reserve were measured for each participant and condition. RESULTS: Kinect conditions revealed significantly higher heart rate, percentage of heart rate reserve, rate of perceived exertion and arousal when compared with treadmill walking (P≤0.001). Opponent-based condition revealed lower values for the rate of perceived exertion (P=0.02) and higher affect (P=0.022) when compared with single play. CONCLUSION: Competitive active video games improved children's psychological responses (affect and rate of perceived exertion) compared with single play, providing a solution that may contribute toward improved adherence to physical activity. © 2015 Pulsus Group Inc.

A real-time on-board control system makes decision autonomously according to the perception from the multi-sensor system. Under the Windows operation system (OS), inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism of Linux OS is introduced into control system design. A distributed software architecture based on IPC, which can be used for multiple mobile robots system, is proposed. The architecture can make the system more flexible and scalable. The expansion of robot's function and cooperation between robots can be easily realized. The experiments and robot soccer game show the validity of the architecture.",eid,2-s2.0-21444438679,Scopus,High Technology Letters,"Jia J., Chen W., Xi Y.",2005,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,"Eeg, Hrv And Psychological Correlates While Playing Bejeweled Ii: A Randomized Controlled Study","Stress related medical disorders such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, depression, and anxiety are serious medical issues that can cause disability and death. Interventions to prevent their development and exacerbation are needed. Casual video games (CVGs) are fun, easy to play, spontaneous and tremendously popular. People report that they play these games because they decrease their stress and improve their mood. This study tested this theory by comparing people playing Bejeweled II a popular CVG with control subjects measured under similar conditions. Electroencephalographic (EEG) changes after playing Bejeweled II were consistent with increased mood and corroborated with similar findings on psychological reports. Moreover, heart rate variability (HRV) changes consistent with autonomic nervous system relaxation or decreased physical stress were also recorded. It is concluded, therefore, that playing a CVG like Bejeweled II can increase mood and decrease stress. These finding have broad implications and include the potential development of prescriptive interventions using Bejeweled II to prevent and treat stress related medical disorders. Finally, these findings demonstrate a method using EEG, HRV and psychological correlates to understand the psychophysiological or cybernetic interconnection between participant and video game.",eid,2-s2.0-77953004503,Scopus,Annual Review of CyberTherapy and Telemedicine,"Russoniello C.V., O'brien K., Parks J.M.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Facing Facts: Best Practices For Common Uses Of Facial Recognition Technologies,"In the 2002 film Minority Report, Steven Spielberg imagined a world in which companies use biometric technology to identify us and serve us targeted ads. Ten years later, that vision is coming closer to reality. Having overcome the high costs and poor accuracy that once stunted its growth, one form of biometric technology-facial recognition-is quickly moving out of the realm of science fiction and into the commercial marketplace. Today, companies are deploying facial recognition technologies in a wide array of contexts, reflecting a spectrum of increasing technological sophistication. At the simplest level, the technology can be used for facial detection; that is, merely to detect and locate a face in a photo. Current uses of facial detection include refining search engine results to include only those results that contain a face; locating faces in images in order to blur them; ensuring that the frame for a video chat feed actually includes a face; or developing virtual eyeglass fitting systems and virtual makeover tools that allow consumers to upload their photos online and ""try on"" a pair of glasses or a new hairstyle. A more refined version of facial recognition technology allows companies to assess characteristics of facial images. For instance, companies can identify moods or emotions from facial expressions to determine a player's engagement with a video game or a viewer's excitement during a movie. Companies can also place cameras into digital signs to determine the demographic characteristics of a face-such as age range and gender-and deliver targeted advertisements in real-time in retail spaces. In the most advanced application, companies can use the technology to compare individuals' facial characteristics across different images in order to identify them. In this application, an image of an individual is matched with another image of the same individual. If the face in either of the two images is identified-that is, the name of the individual is known-then, in addition to being able to demonstrate a match between two faces, the technology can be used to identify previously anonymous faces. This is the use of facial recognition that potentially raises the most serious privacy concerns because it can identify anonymous individuals in images. One prevalent current use of this application is to enable semi-automated photo tagging or photo organization on social networks and in photo management applications. On social networks this feature typically works by scanning new photos a user uploads against existing ""tagged"" photos. The social network then identifies the user's ""friends"" in the new photos so the user can tag them. On December 8, 2011, the Federal Trade Commission (""FTC"" or ""Commission"") hosted a workshop-""Face Facts: A Forum on Facial Recognition Technology"" (""Face Facts workshop"")-to explore developments in this rapidly evolving field. Panelists discussed a number of issues, including: recent advances in facial recognition technologies; current and possible future commercial uses of facial recognition technologies; ways consumers can benefit from these uses; and privacy and security concerns raised. Following the workshop, the FTC received eighty public comments discussing these issues from private citizens, industry representatives, trade groups, consumer and privacy advocates, think tanks, and members of Congress. In this report, FTC staff has synthesized those discussions and comments in order to develop recommended best practices for protecting consumer privacy in this area, while promoting innovation. To begin, staff recommends that companies using facial recognition technologies design their services with privacy in mind, that is, by implementing ""privacy by design,"" in a number of ways. First, companies should maintain reasonable data security protections for consumers' images and the biometric information collected from those images to enable facial recognition (for example, unique measurements such as size of features or distance between the eyes or the ears). As the increasing public availability of identified images online has been a major factor in the increasing commercial viability of facial recognition technologies, companies that store such images should consider putting protections in place that would prevent unauthorized scraping which can lead to unintended secondary uses. Second, companies should establish and maintain appropriate retention and disposal practices for the consumer images and biometric data that they collect. For example, if a consumer creates an account on a website that allows her to virtually ""try on"" eyeglasses, uploads photos to that website, and then later deletes her account on the website, the photos are no longer necessary and should be discarded. Third, companies should consider the sensitivity of information when developing their facial recognition products and services. For instance, companies developing digital signs equipped with cameras using facial recognition technologies should consider carefully where to place such signs and avoid placing them in sensitive areas, such as bathrooms, locker rooms, health care facilities, or places where children congregate. Staff also recommends several ways for companies using facial recognition technologies to provide consumers with simplified choices and increase the transparency of their practices. For example, companies using digital signs capable of demographic detection-which often look no different than digital signs that do not contain cameras-should provide clear notice to consumers that the technologies are in use, before consumers come into contact with the signs. Similarly, social networks using a facial recognition feature should provide users with a clear notice-outside of a privacy policy-about how the feature works, what data it collects, and how it will use the data. Social networks should also provide consumers with (1) an easy to find, meaningful choice not to have their biometric data collected and used for facial recognition; and (2) the ability to turn off the feature at any time and delete any biometric data previously collected from their tagged photos. Finally, there are at least two scenarios in which companies should obtain consumers' affirmative express consent before collecting or using biometric data from facial images. First, they should obtain a consumer's affirmative express consent before using a consumer's image or any biometric data derived from that image in a materially different manner than they represented when they collected the data. Second, companies should not use facial recognition to identify anonymous images of a consumer to someone who could not otherwise identify him or her, without obtaining the consumer's affirmative express consent. Consider the example of a mobile app that allows users to identify strangers in public places, such as on the street or in a bar. If such an app were to exist, a stranger could surreptitiously use the camera on his mobile phone to take a photo of an individual who is walking to work or meeting a friend for a drink and learn that individual's identity-and possibly more information, such as her address-without the individual even being aware that her photo was taken. Given the significant privacy and safety risks that such an app would raise, only consumers who have affirmatively chosen to participate in such a system should be identified. The recommended best practices contained in this report are intended to provide guidance to commercial entities that are using or plan to use facial recognition technologies in their products and services. However, to the extent the recommended best practices go beyond existing legal requirements, they are not intended to serve as a template for law enforcement actions or regulations under laws currently enforced by the FTC. If companies consider the issues of privacy by design, meaningful choice, and transparency at this early stage, it will help ensure that this industry develops in a way that encourages companies to offer innovative new benefits to consumers and respect their privacy interests. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

,"Faunal Assemblage Structure On The Patton Seamount (Gulf Of Alaska, Usa)","Epibenthic and demersal assemblages of fish and invertebrates on the Patton Seamount in the Gulf of Alaska, U.S.A., were studied in July 1999 using the Deep Sea Research Vehicle Alvin. Faunal associations with depth were described using video analysis of 8 dives from 151 to 3,375 m. A cluster analysis applied to the observations suggests three benthic faunal communities based on depth: 1) a shallow-water community (151-950 m) consisting mainly of rockfishes, flatfishes, sea stars, and attached suspension feeders, 2) a mid-depth community (400-1500 m) also consisting of numerous attached suspension-feeding organisms such as corals, sponges, crinoids, sea anemones, and sea cucumbers and fish such as the sablefish Anoplopoma fimbria and the giant grenadier Albatrossia pectoralis both of which were aggregated over a relatively narrow depth range, and 3) a deep-water community (500-3,375 m) consisting of fewer attached suspension feeders and more highly mobile species such as the Pacific grenadier Coryphaenoides acrolepis, popeye grenadier C. cinereus, Pacific flatnose Antimora microlepis, and large mobile crabs Macroregonia macrochira and Chionoecetes spp. that were less aggregated and covered a much greater depth range. Bottom depth was highly correlated with temperature and bottom substratum type where the upper 1,300 m was primarily a mixed habitat of boulders and large cobbles. The bottom substratum types were less diverse from 1,300 m to 3,300 m, which was composed of gravels and smaller sized particles. The absence of many near shore species on the Patton Seamount suggests this seamount is a unique subset of the near shore fauna but maintains distinct assemblage characteristics.

,Game-Paddle Control Linearity Test.,"It is possible to use the game-paddle inputs on the Apple II to measure physical properties like resistance, capacitance, temperature, and light intensity. There are two important considerations in such measurements. The first is whether the output of the game-paddle instruction, y equals PDL(x), varies linearly with the physical property. Equally important is the scale factor - the ratio of y to the value of the physical property corresponding to y. A program listing is presented to test the linearity of the game-paddle input and obtains the scale factor. The program contains two simple loops. The inside loop reads the game-paddle port, prints the output on the screen of the video monitor, and tests the keyboard of the Apple II for a keystroke. When a keystroke occurs, the program requests the input of a physical quantity. It is shown how to measure resistance using the Apple II microcomputer.",eid,2-s2.0-0022147398,Scopus,Byte,De Jong Marvin L.,1985,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,How Video Games May Enhance Students' Learning And Cognitive Development,"Despite the fact that video games have a reputation ""as mindless pursuits used strictly for entertainment"" (Rice, 2005), numerous researchers believe that playing them may have positive impacts on students' learning (e.g., Aldrich, 2004; Elliot, Adams, & Bruckman, 2002; Gee, 2003, 2006; Mohamed & Jaafar, 2010) and cognitive development (Green & Bavelier, 2006; Sherry, 2006). Consequently, the potential value that video games have on students' overall well being deserves special attention. This paper explores what makes a video game so appealing to players, along with what one can learn by playing video games prior to proposing them as excellent complementary tools for instruction. Specifically, this paper focuses on: 1) how video games may enhance students' learning when incorporated in educational settings; 2) how playing video games may have a positive effect on students' cognitive development; and 3) the implications of designing and implementing educational video games within the school.

,Humanoid Personalized Avatar Through Multiple Natural Language Processing,"There has been a growing interest in implementing humanoid avatars in networked virtual environment. However, most existing avatar communication systems do not take avatars' social backgrounds into consideration. This paper proposes a novel humanoid avatar animation system to represent personalities and facial emotions of avatars based on culture, profession, mood, age, taste, and so forth. We extract semantic keywords from the input text through natural language processing, and then the animations of personalized avatars are retrieved and displayed according to the order of the keywords. Our primary work is focused on giving avatars run-time instruction from multiple natural languages. Experiments with Chinese, Japanese and English input based on the prototype show that interactive avatar animations can be displayed in real time and be made available online. This system provides a more natural and interesting means of human communication, and therefore is expected to be used for cross-cultural communication, multiuser online games, and other entertainment applications.",eid,2-s2.0-78649577032,Scopus,"World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology","Hou J., Wang X., Xu F., Nguyena V.D., Wu L.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,"In Narrow Heart Vessels, Catheter Device Prevails","Nearly everyone reading this column has used a joystick remote control to play a video game. Weaving a player through a dangerous maze of obstacles and around corners seeking to damage or destroy the enemy in an effort to win the game is a great form of entertainment, but for some of us, a similar technique may one day save our lives. Nearly 90,000 Americans are diagnosed with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) per year. This heart rhythm can drive the heart to beat up to 200 beats per minute and cause shortness of breath, chest pain, and lightheadedness. There are several subclasses of SVT, with the most common being atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT) and atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia (AVRT). Each of these has an abrupt onset and endpoint and when accompanied by unhealthy coronary arteries can cause chest pain and, potentially, an acute cardiac event. SVT is about twice as common in women as it is in men and the condition is generally thought to arise because of a person's anatomy, that is, there is more than one electrical pathway carrying the electrical impulse from the atrium to the ventricle. If a beat occurs at an incorrect time, the two different pathways cause a circular transmission of the impulse that in turn causes the rapid heart beat. ©MediMedia USA.",eid,2-s2.0-70349558544,Scopus,Managed Care,Morrow T.,2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,"Interactivity, Inhabitation And Pragmatist Aesthetics","As the cultural presence of video games continues to grow and pop culture has become even more of a subject for philosophy, a debate has raged over the aesthetic character of video games. While refraining from the familiar debate over whether games are in fact art, this article argues that a valuable and previously unexplored framework for analyzing their aesthetic character is John Dewey's pragmatist aesthetics. Spectatorial and institutional approaches are rejected on the grounds that they do not speak to the unique qualities of the video game medium. Dewey's aesthetic theory gives a central place to interactivity and embodiment, critical elements of video games. It also allows gamers to respond to the charge that games are trivial and childish by means of a distinction between simple discharge of emotions and their expression. © 2001 - 2011 Game Studies.",eid,2-s2.0-79960752516,Scopus,Game Studies,Deen P.D.,2011,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Lifeisgame Prototype: A Serious Game About Emotions For Children With Autism Spectrum Disorders,"This paper presents the LIFEisGAME prototype-Ipad version - a serious game that proposes to enhance facial and emotional recognition skills in children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). We assess the prototype game regarding motivation to play and game usability, and also participants' emotional recognition abilities and technology usage. People with autism are less likely to gaze at faces and are also impaired in face discrimination tasks. Recently, technology plays an active role in helping these individuals to understand emotions and recognise facial expressions. LIFEisGAME prototype was played during a 15 minute game session by 11 children with ASD, with ages varying from 5-15 years old (M=9.27, SD=2.97), 91% were male and 9% were female, 82% were verbal ASD and 18% were non-verbal ASD. We video recorded each child and the footage was analysed according to game usability and motivation to play. Parents (n=11) filled out a parental consent form and a questionnaire about their child's technology usage and their emotional understanding. Therapists' opinions (n=8) about the game were given during an unstructured interview. The game was presented on an Ipad 4 (9.7 inches, 2048×1536). Participants enjoyed the prototype but it still needs to be simplified. All participants had experience with computer games. Fear, disgust and surprise were the most challenging emotions to recognise. Parents suggested adding musical stimuli to promote motivation and therapists recommended to include visual game instructions. Technology is a useful resource for autism and LIFEisGAME utilises technology to promote emotional understanding, bringing positive outcomes to quality of life for children with autism.",eid,2-s2.0-84894823296,Scopus,PsychNology Journal,"Alves S., Marques A., Queirós C., Orvalho V.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Machine Implementation Of Human-Like Intuition,"In everyday life, people tend to make quick decisions based on intuition. We propose that intuition may be implemented by mapping the current situation to some previous experiences with the same attribute, and ranking the experiences according to recentness and emotion. Two examples are provided: the intuition process may decide to flip a coin for guessing which team would win a soccer game, or to check only women wearing blue dress for finding someone in a crowded train station. Surprisingly, these ""irrational"" decisions from intuition process may actually be more efficient in solving problems, while logical process suffers from slowness and the problem of data reliability. For a computer, the intuition process is a new way of solving problems, and will become a new methodology in intelligent systems. © 2013 ICIC International.",eid,2-s2.0-84877746057,Scopus,ICIC Express Letters,"Chik D., Dundas J.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Media Effects On Antisocial Behavior In Children And Adolescents,"There is mounting evidence on the effects of media on antisocial and aggressive behaviour. This chapter reviews current research on the topic, which has focused on how media violence effects on arousal, affect, cognition and behaviour. Most evidence comes from television and video games research and the differential effects of these two types of media on the individual are examined. Additional evidence from studies on the Internet effects and music and lyrics is also provided. The main short and long-term effects of media violence are also discussed, suggesting different explanatory models. Another important distinction examined relates to the types of violence displayed on the media. Most of the effects of media violence relate to the development, over-learning and reinforcement of aggression-related knowledge structures, including hostile attribution bias, aggressive actions against others, expectations of violence, positive attitudes towards violence, the belief that violence is acceptable and appropriate to solve problems, and desensitization. Although aggressive and antisocial behavior is affected by media violence, there is also evidence that a raw amount of media use, regardless of its violent content, has an impact on behavior. The social perspective of the individual mediates the relation between raw media use and behavior. This is explained in terms of the lack of role-taking opportunities that media provide, compared to other sources of socialization. The inability to adopt another's perspective and the lack of opportunities for cognitive de-centering and the reduction of egocentric bias limit the adolescent's capacity to calculate the consequences of own behavior. It also limits his/her understanding of the needs, feelings, desires, purposes, and worries of other people. Individuals in this situation would be unable to grasp the most direct consequences of their behavior and, consequently, would be more likely to engage in antisocial conducts. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

,Music And Driving Game Performance,"This study investigated the effects of the nature of music and a concurrent task on measures of task performance and musical preference. Subjects completed 5 laps of a computer motor racing game whilst listening to either arousing or relatively unarousing music in either the presence or absence of a backward-counting task. Both these manipulations affected performance on the game with arousing music and backward-counting leading to slower lap times than relatively unarousing music and the absence of the backward-counting task. Backward-counting led to lower liking for the music than did the absence of this task. These results support the idea that music and the concurrent task competed for a limited processing resource. The results also indicated that liking for the music was positively related to task performance, and in conjunction these findings seem to suggest a direct link between music and the listening context.",eid,2-s2.0-0008561938,Scopus,Scandinavian Journal of Psychology,"North A.C., Hargreaves D.J.",1999,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Natural Language Control Of Interactivvoe 3D Animation And Computer Games,"In this paper we describe a fully implemented system for speech and natural language control of 3D animation and computer games. The experimental framework has features that have been emulated from the popular DOOM™ computer game. It implements an integrated parser based on a linguistic formalism tailored to the processing of the specific natural language instructions required to control a player character. This parser outputs structured message formats to the animation layer, which further interprets these messages to generate behaviours for the scene objects. We have found that interactive control significantly impacts on the behavioural interpretation of natural language semantics. Besides bringing stringent requirements in terms of response times for the natural language processing step, it determines the level of autonomy that the animated character should possess, which in turn influences the generation of behavioural scripts from natural language instructions. &copy; Springer-Verlag London Ltd.",eid,2-s2.0-0008541250,Scopus,Virtual Reality,"Cavazza M., Palmer I.",1999,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,New Perspectives On Employee Motivation: Balancing The Big 4,"The concept of “flow,” popularized by Mihály Csikszentmihalyi, is an intrinsic and highly focused state of motivation. Initially, it has been studied for video game players, but the effect has recently been cited across various disciplines. Flow can occur when there is the right balance between the challenge [C] of a task and the corresponding skill set [S] of the individual performing the task. Recent research findings shed light on how to balance these two factors and create optimal flow conditions in the workplace. The findings translate into management tools that provide an atmosphere which encourages high engagement and performance. Flow is also a highly energized state where senses and emotions are in full alignment with the task that is carried out. A motivational framework therefore needs to take a second dimension into account. It has to balance the workload [WL] of an employee and his/her capacity to work [CW], thus ensuring that the mid-term and long-term effectiveness of employees is maintained. Pushing employees down an energy-depleting path can quickly lead to a drop in performance or even fatigue or burn-out. Instead, organizations need to apply strategies to leverage wellsprings and effectively reenergize their workforce. Balancing the Big 4 factors challenge [C] vs. skill [S], and workload [WL] vs. capacity to work [CW], are the centerpiece of the resulting new framing of employee motivation. It can help to increase satisfaction and achievements of employees and thus boost the effectiveness of organizations. © Common Ground, Melanie Seemann, Thomas Seemann, All Rights Reserved.",eid,2-s2.0-84960492891,Scopus,"International Journal of Knowledge, Culture and Change Management","Seemann M., Seemann T.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,New Uses For Wearable Textile-Based Health Monitoring Technology,"Wearable health monitoring systems employ sensors to read vital signs from the human body - such as the heart rate, body temperature and blood pressure. Textile-based sensors can be woven or knitted into an item of clothing and wom next to the skin. Information picked up can be sent to an electronic device where it can be recorded or displayed and used to provide the wearer with bio-feedback. Wearable health monitoring systems were originally developed to monitor the health of astronauts, and then transmit information to control stations on earth. More recently, they have been used in the medical sector to monitor patients, including those recovering from operations away from hospital. One company at the foreftont of wearable health monitoring is USA-based Textronics. The company has four product families: Textro-Sensors or conductive fabric electrodes and motion sensors; Textro Interconnect laminate wiring cable; Textro Yarn elastic conductive fibre; and Textro Polymer variable resistive polymer. Its first product was the NuMetrex branded sports bra Since then it has added the NuMetrex Cardio Shirt for men and the NuMetrex Racer Tank for women. More recently, it has launched Heart Smart apparel to enable it to expand from the sports to the health market. Target customers will include those focusing on weight loss and hearl health. It has also launched a developer's kit containing all the parts needed to make a wearable health monitoring system. The kit includes textile sensors - approved by the USA-based Food and Drug Administration (FDA) - as an alternative to the adhesive electrodes and metal wristbands commonly used with electrocardiograph (ECG) instruments. Forecasts from Venture Development Corporation (VDC) suggest that sales of smart fabrics and interactive textiles (SFIT) for sensing and monitoring will grow by 49.3% a year between 2006 and 2010. NPD Group has predicted that interactive apparel is likely to become a billion dollar business before long. Promising applications include fitness, corporate wellness, lifestyle health, medical health care, facilitation of independent living by the elderly, military uses and sports. Futuristic ideas include clothing which is capable of reading a person's emotional state for use in computer games. Another concept is that of ""tele health"", whereby patients would be diagnosed and treated without having to visit a doctor. Overall, the outlook for wearable textile-based health monitoring systems is positive. But to gain mass acceptance by consumers, devices need to be comfortable, easy to carefor, reliable, easy to use, and inexpensive. © Textiles Intelligence Limited 2008.",eid,2-s2.0-53249117575,Scopus,Textile Outlook International,[No author name available],2008,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,"Pc Pinocchios: Parents, Children, And The Metamorphosis Tradition In Science Fiction","What viewer of 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) can forget the moment when the computer HAL 9000 faces his death and sings ""A Bicycle Built for Two""? The melody winds down as HAL loses consciousness. It is a poignant moment in which the technological creation, a conscious being whose increasing power we are supposed to fear, regresses to the point of his seemingly innocent creation. The melody reminds us that he was created like a child and sung to by a creator who must have deployed the song as, on the one hand, a recording test and, on the other, a nurturing lullaby. It is a moment that asks us to consider our parental responsibilities and changing relationships to the beings we create, whether organic or machine. In fact, the film asks us to consider the fine line between machine and organic creations through lyrical scenes in which the human characters wear and depend upon various technologies to eat, breathe, and move. The technological child is one that human beings create again and again, only to regard it with horror as it seizes the tools of the father and rises to power in a classic Promethean or Frankenstein plot. Suspicion of the technologies we spawn has become a folklore plotline in itself. A recent spoof of 2001 in the children's cartoon Recess (ABC/UPN, 1999-present) reveals that both parents and children are expected to identify with aspects of this story (""Schoolworld"" episode). This plot has become a parable that seeks to teach parents and children to consider the mysteries of creationism and child development. But it also regards these mysteries with suspicion, asking us to consider the relationship between children and technology. Are our technological creations offspring that we shun because they threaten our authority and bring about our obsolescence? These questions are overtly addressed at the end of the introduction to AI: Artificial Intelligence (2001), adapted from Brian Aldiss's 1969 story ""Super-Toys Last All Summer Long."" In AI, David (Haley Joel Osment) is a cyberchild, programmed to love its parents but then rejected by them. The film posits the idea that, while we can create a simulated child with emotions and consciousness, it is much more difficult to find parents who can return a child's love and raise him or her with a proper sense of ethics, responsibility, and morality. The technological child evokes our sibling rivalry; once we recognize its independence as a created being, we seek to disconnect it. AI depicts the sibling rivalry between two children, one cyborg and created to love unconditionally, the other an organic child who looks partially cyborg due to assistive devices for walking. Who is the monster in this film? The father/programmer, the computer, or the human sibling, a symbol of the peer community that fears it? Frankenstein's creature, HAL, and Spielberg's artificial child are Adams of our genesis impulse. They are born in innocence and tragically engineered by environment to act in particularly monstrous ways. What does it mean to develop as a human being, these films ask? How have technological creations come to stand for our sentiments about universal patterns of child development, today's computer-aged children, and our own flaws as a parenting culture? It is perhaps not surprising that the dawn of the computer age features science-fiction films with the Frankenstein theme of a child surpassing the powers of the creator, who, like the divine being of Genesis, built it from clay, simulated flesh, or wires and electricity. The theme of development from tabula rasa to monster or outcast explains the genre's popularity with family audiences, particularly teenagers. In many films, machines simultaneously replace or threaten youth and mirror the concerns of both young people and their parents regarding human development. For example, in Disney's The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes (1969), a student, Dexter (Kurt Russell), merges with a computer and becomes intellectually gifted but forgets basic human values such as friendship. In Tron (1982), another Disney film, we encounter the cosmic battle between a corporate father figure and his progeny, both a computer that displaces its creator and a hacker whom the father has dispossessed because of the hacker's gaming skill. In WarGames (1983), a teen hacker is asked to develop a relationship with and reform a computer system that was created as a child substitute but has become monstrous and needs to recall the innocent play of early childhood. The restoration of a proper childhood is echoed in Terminator 2 (1991) and Warner Brothers' animated feature The Iron Giant (1999), both of which represent the computerized machine as a reprogrammable child that only needs the touch of a real child to learn how to play, feel, and respect life.1 Perhaps the most childlike cyborg of all is Data (Brent Spiner) of Star Trek's The Next Generation (syndication, 1987-1994). In Star Trek: Insurrection (1998), Data obtains lessons from a real child in how to play, something that these films feel is necessary to aid wholesome growth and human understanding. AI is only the logical culmination of the genre's testing ground for what makes a child-creature human and how we can resolve our conflicted feelings toward child development in the computer age, which seems to have robbed children of innocence and allowed them to surpass adults in skill, power, and authority. The theme of childlike machines and machinelike children is pervasive enough to justify what Mikel J. Koven calls a ""motif spotting"" methodology (2003, 183), the enumeration of traditional folklore motifs in what I see as the dynamic, modern storytelling of popular film. While the relation of film to traditional folk storytelling is a question for folklorists, as a children's literature critic, I feel that an analysis of pervasive motifs across cinematic and literary texts can illuminate ambiguities (particularly toward children) localized in our collective, cultural unconscious. In my view, the films that I discuss are coming-of-age tales that endlessly replay the power of the transformation folktale to capture our Western view of child development. Computer characters grow from a state of puppetry, given genesis but not freedom, to adulthood, which means determining their own destiny and understanding the meanings and responsibilities of being human-but not without growing pains that are experienced as monstrous. These science fiction films appropriate the traditional folkloric motifs of magical transformation (D0-D499), magic objects (D800-D1699), and creation of man (A1200-A1299) through the motif of inanimate objects coming to life. These narrative elements are common to folk-based stories of child development that have become staples of children's literature in such stories as Carlo Collodi's The Adventures of Pinocchio ([1881] 1996) and Margery Williams's The Velveteen Rabbit ([1922] 1958). As animals and folk heroes have traditionally functioned, toys are simultaneously child characters and more than children. They stand for children when they embark on journeys to understand their relationship to their creators and develop their own sense of consciousness and agency; characters undergo metamorphosis when they have explored and mastered what it means to be human.2 A tough adolescence typically intervenes in this quest for mastery. Science-fiction films have adopted the toy-folklore combination to express similar themes with computer progeny. While computer ""children"" function as folk heroes, exploring human development in the universal sense described by Donna Rosenberg (1997) in her collection of folktales for children, they also express our wonder at and fear of today's computer-age children, who threaten adults with obsolescence. © 2007 by Utah State University Press.

,Plain To See An Example Of Popular Theology In Decision-Making Gaming (L.a. Noire),"The video game L.A. Noire (Rockstar Games, 2011) replaces a theocentric worldview with anthropomorphically amended versions of spiritual life. For instance, the attribution of human values and even of a body to obviously impersonal existence is conspicuous. In the unfolding of the plot, moral conduct and notions of duty are commonly thought to stand for a mostly unseen and silent God. He is treated accordingly, i.e., as having both extrinsic and intrinsic representations in public fictions. Even more, a popular (mis)construal of Theology is part of the aesthetic tradition that games are bound to fall into. The fictionalizing of the daily life in the gaming industry essentially relies on sensational incidents and violent appeals to emotions. The cultural discourse of game-playing brings together the visual and the sonic set-up of godly absence/presence plain to see in the familiar re-enactment of the social intercourse and in the re-construction of a mostly urban landscape. Basically, the computer generated interface is immersive insofar as it features ethically-minded versus morally-corrupt characters. The video games aesthetics showcases a version of the Western pop culture that fits the obviously monotheist mould of our European past. What drives the usually minimal plot of mainstream digital storytelling is the compulsive belief in one legitimizing truth. The underlying cultural narrative is that of one hero, who embodies statistics about biography and sets out to enforce his authority over the world. The search for existential answers to questions of life purpose is limited to the presuppositions of the Western civilisation. The conclusion is that a melodramatic paradigm structures the ethical and societal issues touched upon by current mainstream video games. © 2015, European Journal of Science and Theology.

,Probogotchi: A Novel Edutainment Device As A Bridge For Interaction Between A Child With Asd And The Typically Developed Sibling,"There has been a considerable transformation in game preferences of children with the rapid development of information and communication technology. Computer games became the mostly preferred spare time activity for children of different ages. Several studies found that technology, ranging from computer applications to social robots, can act as a mediator to improve interaction for children with social impairments. The contribution presented is an intermediate step which combines the embodiment with tangible and intuitive interaction that social robots can offer and an affordable and autonomous solution as a computer game. Probogotchi is a way to play an educational computer game, where children have to interact with a toy equipped with sensors connected to a PC. The control architecture is built around an artificial homeostatic system for social agents and is set to simulate pet-like behavior, resulting in a dependency on the user's interactions. As such, affective human-computer interaction is achieved. The homeostatic regulation is an autonomous system that uses input stimuli from a tactile and object identification system to detect certain actions originating from the user. If an action is triggered, it will influence the internal needs that are subsequently translated into an emotional state. This emotional state is communicated back to the user by a virtual model showing the corresponding facial expression. For the evaluation section, a preliminary study using Probogotchi as a bridge for interaction between a child with ASD and his typically developed sibling is for the first time described. Quantitative data and qualitative observations are presented. The paper concludes with a focus on the technical limitations and also on future developments and implications for the clinical use of Probogotchi game for children with autism. © 2016, ASCR Press.

,Reading With Preschool Children Guided By Regulatory Or Emancipatory Purposes: A Case Study,"The theoretical framework guiding this article builds on the tension between the differing perspectives on literacy learning: is it best taught using autonomous activities or activities embedded in a social, historical, and cultural context as described by the autonomous versus the ideological model for literacy. The read-aloud practices have been studied in one case study (data from interviews, lengthy observations, focus group interviews, artifacts, video recordings) of a preschool where thematic work guided the activities. They were also examined in one larger study where preschool teachers and teacher trainees documented the reading activities, by use of observation schedules, during one week in forty different preschools. Converging evidence indicate a tension between planned language games and phonics exercises on the one hand and on the other hand child initiated emergent literacy activities, such as pretend reading and prewriting. The emergent literacy activities were observed in connection with thematic work. In the larger sample of preschools, thematic work did not occur and the purpose of the read-alouds was predominantly regulatory or disciplinary to make the children rest. The differences between thematic reading, regulatory reading, and child initiated play reading will be illuminated and analyzed. © Common Ground, Ulla Damber.",eid,2-s2.0-84930792462,Scopus,International Journal of Literacies,Damber U.,2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali

,Reclaiming Public Spaces Through Performance Of The Zombie Walk,"With the stench of rotting flesh, the guttural, animalistic groans and the haunting noise of their dragging limbs, zombies have managed to remain a frightful mythical monster in popular culture. Zombies are bodies without emotions, acting on primal instincts alone. They speak to everything that we as humans are not supposed to be. Their predisposition toward brains, flesh, blood and gore creates an uncomfortable fascination for horror fans. However, I would argue that the popularity of zombies in North America is also largely attributable to the fact that their very existence counters many dominant norms that circulate within our society, specifically calling us to question ideas surrounding beautiful bodies, life and death, structured spaces, and mass consumption. In a capitalist economy fuelled by the pathological need for continual growth, it becomes clear that the zombie of modern film and television often acts as a stand-in for the true cultural dupes of mass consumption: us (Dendle 2007, 51). They also symbolize apocalyptic events, when humans and all their daily spaces and practices are slowly taken over by the undead: Animated corpses. In popular zombie films, the undead are almost always portrayed in public spaces, walking-or dragging- Themselves from place to place, consuming in the most literal of ways (i.e., eating human flesh). As they move slowly through public spaces, invoking fear in the humans around them, they take on a familiar appearance: us, just going through the motions. The commentary here is clear: we, too, can be zombies, even if our hearts are still beating. The popularity of zombies is found not only in the abundance of zombie films created over the years (Night of the Living Dead, Army of Darkness, 28 Days Later and Shaun of the Dead, to name but a few), but also in the ways that zombies have infiltrated our daily lives. The flesh and gore associated with zombies have managed to creep their way into nearly every facet of popular culture-works of fiction and comic books (The Zombie Survival Guide, Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, The Walking Dead, Blackest Night); video games (Left 4 Dead, Resident Evil, Dead Rising); board games (Zombies!!!, Last Night on Earth); music (""Walk like a Zombie"" by the HorrorPops, Rob Zombie, Zombie Girl); and even zombie pinups and porn (ZombiePinups. com, Porn of the Dead). One of the most interesting examples of zombies in everyday culture is the zombie walk, in which mass groups of the ""living dead"" congregate in large cities all over North America and Western Europe, and march in the streets. This is a relatively recent phenomenon, with the first documented, non-commercial zombie walk taking place in Toronto, Ontario, in 2003 (Dalgetty 2007). These walks are comprised of individuals, primarily teenagers and young adults, dressed and made up as zombies, walking, shuffling and dragging themselves slowly through urban spaces. As the zombies shuffle and drag themselves along, they cause a spectacle: They halt traffic, stop pedestrians from shopping ""normally,"" disturb onlookers and raise questions. Because our urban spaces are highly ordered and regulated places, the purposeful disruption of the zombie walk-the performance of the living dead in public areas-affords the opportunity to reclaim urban spaces and disrupt dominant ideologies, even if only momentarily. Very few monsters have managed to embed themselves within the popular imagination as successfully as zombies. Although most monsters originate in folklore, then move to literature and finally enter mainstream cinema, the zombie is one of the few monsters that has moved directly from folklore to the popular imagination (McIntosh 2008, 2). McIntosh notes that our fascination with zombies seems to trace back to Haitian folklore via the ethnographies of ethnobiologist Wade Davis. According to his reports, there are two types of literal zombies: The spirit zombies (zombie jardin) and the type that has made its way into popular culture: The body raised from the dead (zombie corps cadavre) (2). The zombies-or victims-are put into a near-death state by means of a poisonous mixture made in part from the toxins of a blowfish and then later revived through the use of another mixture (3). Through this process, the victims end up losing many of their mental faculties, functioning at a much slower pace than normal, allowing them to be easily controlled by the individual who poisoned them. Although such descriptions can be found in a few travelogues dating back to the late eighteenth century, it was not until the US military occupation of Haiti from 1915 to 1934 that Haitian folklore began to make its way out of Haiti and into American news reports and cultural imaginaries (McIntosh 2008, 4). As with many cultural exports, accuracy was not of most importance in disseminating this new information. Instead, a sensationalized and magical image of Haitian voodoo began to be promoted. It was specifically the image of a slowmoving individual in a trance-like state that became the model for the horror monsters we see today. Entering the scene in 1932, with Kenneth Webb's stage production of Zombie, and later that year with the first zombie film, White Zombie (Halperin brothers), the majority of the content of these films dealt with female possession for men's sexual pleasure and/or black-white racial issues (McIntosh 2008, 5). The zombies in these films generally stayed the same, with only a simple change of scenery to suit the era's political climate. For the most part, they were simply slow versions of humans, with less tidy clothing. McIntosh notes that this all changed- And would forever change the face of zombie films thereafter- with George A. Romero's 1968 Night of the Living Dead (8). Both that film and Romero's following two films, Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead, deal with issues pertinent to North American culture. They provide a visual commentary for the horrific aspects of our culture that we normally do not question. Night of the Living Dead predominantly takes place in a family's farmhouse and depicts the characters fighting for their lives against a horde of zombies that threaten to infiltrate from the outside. ""Much of the narrative attention,"" Dendle contends, ""is thus devoted not to attacks or human-zombie conflicts, but to re-examining the middle-class household of heartland America"" (2007, 50). The movement from urban spaces into gated communities allowed individuals to better defend their modern homes, values and ideals against the monstrous ""other"" that lurked outside the door. This apocalyptic sense is also evident in Dawn of the Dead, ""a social commentary on American mass consumer society as zombies overtake survivors barricaded in a shopping mall, and Day of the Dead, when the world is apparently almost completely overrun by zombies and there are only a few survivors left"" (McIntosh 2008, 9). Romero's films are important for the simple reason that they forever changed public perception of the zombie and allow for an intriguing, easily accessible creature that has quickly become the monster of choice for many performances. To properly situate the zombie walk as a performance of subversion and reclamation, the construction of our current city spaces needs to be discussed. How do these spaces limit the possibility for subversion and social upheaval? Also, the zombie walk is a particular type of performance that draws heavily from the Situationist International's theory of détournement: The reclaiming of already existing objects/spaces/ideas found in society and then using them for alternative purposes. Finally, the performance of the undead, though tinged with political curiosity, is a site of extreme playfulness. It is within the space of performance and play that the zombie walk is able to momentarily subvert dominant social norms and replace them with the utterly grotesque. © 2011 by University of Ottawa Press.",eid,2-s2.0-84903678520,Scopus,Braaaiiinnnsss!: From Academics to Zombies,Cocarla S.,2011,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer1,Ali

,Self-Localization Based On Monocular Vision For Humanoid Robot,"Robot soccer game is one of the significant and interesting areas among most of the autonomous robotic researches. Following the humanoid soccer robot basic movement and strategy actions, the robot is operated in a dynamic and unpredictable contest environment and must recognize the position of itself in the field all the time. Therefore, the localization system of the soccer robot becomes the key technology to improve the performance. This work proposes efficient approaches for humanoid robot and uses one landmark to accomplish the self-localization. This localization mechanism integrates the information from the pan/tilt motors and a single camera on the robot head together with the artificial neural network technique to adaptively adjust the humanoid robot position. The neural network approach can improve the precision of the localization. The experimental results indicate that the average accuracy ratio is 88.5% under frame rate of 15 frames per second (fps), and the average error for the distance between the actual position and the measured position of the object is 6.68 cm.",eid,2-s2.0-84863030906,Scopus,Tamkang Journal of Science and Engineering,"Chang S.-H., Hsia C.-H., Chang W.-H., Chiang J.-S.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Simulation And Reinforcement Learning With Soccer Agents,"Multi-Agent Systems extend research in Artificial Intelligence and agent systems by incorporating cooperative learning and agent teaming architectures. Agent teaming is a key research area of multi-agent systems that is mainly composed of artificial intelligence and distributed computing techniques. The reasoning and learning ability of agents in uncertain environments via communication and collaboration (in both competitive and cooperative situations) is another key feature for autonomous agents. Many theoretical and applied techniques have been applied to the investigation of autonomous agents with respect to coordination, cooperation, and learning abilities. Due to the inherent complexity of real-time, stochastic, and dynamic environments, it is often extremely complex and difficult to formally verify their properties a priori. In addition, it is quite difficult to generate enough episodes via real applications for training the goal-oriented agent’s individual and cooperative learning abilities. In most cases, such abilities can be obtained via computer simulation, rather than directly from real applications. In doing so, a simulation testbed is applied to test the learning algorithms in the specified scenarios. The objective of this paper is to improve the convergence and efficiency of reinforcement learning algorithms for large, continuous state-action spaces, by finding the optimal values of the parameters for those algorithms. In this paper, the game of soccer is adopted as the simulation environment in conjunction with optimisation techniques to verify goal-oriented agents’ competitive and cooperative learning abilities for decision making. We use the Sarsa learning algorithm with a linear function approximation technique known as tile coding to avoid the state space growing exponentially. The convergence and efficiency of Sarsa algorithm are investigated through simulating a soccer game. © 2008 - IOS Press and the authors.",eid,2-s2.0-85006272607,Scopus,Multiagent and Grid Systems,"Leng J., Fyfe C., Jain L.",2008,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Single-Switch Control Versus Powered Wheelchair For Training Cause-Effect Relationships: Case Studies,"Objectives. Traditional habilitation recommends the use of single switch control and simple computer games as pre-training of cause-effect relationships and joystick control before training in use of a powered wheelchair. Findings from studies of individuals at an early developmental level driving a powered wheelchair suggest it may be more effective to reverse order. Methods. We studied the outcome of powered wheelchair activity in context (self-directed locomotion). Participants included 40 disabled individuals and 17 typically developed infants functioning at an early developmental level. The activity in the wheelchair was paralleled with the use of single switch controls connected both to toys and to a computer with simple 'press-action' software. Results. The cognitive understanding of the simple cause-effect (use of joystick causes the effect of motion of the wheelchair) developed earlier than the understanding (press on single switch causes activation of toy or apparatus). Conclusion. The recommendation to use single switch controls as pre-training for driving a powered wheelchair corresponds with individuals with quite good cognitive function but not with individuals who function at an early developmental level. For individuals with severe or profound mental retardation the possibilities to understand cause-effect relationships are found in tools that affect all their senses, their whole body. A powered wheelchair is such a tool. When the individual activates the joystick, the wheelchair moves, affecting all senses and the individual's position in space. This event provides arousal, interest and motivation to further manipulate and explore the cause of the effect.",eid,2-s2.0-0033500452,Scopus,Technology and Disability,"Nilsson L., Nyberg P.",1999,Article,NA,reviewer1,Ali

,'U Got 2 Move It' Pilot Study: Impact Of An After-School Interactive Video Exertainment Program For Underserved Children.,"Background. The prevalence of childhood overweight in the United States has increased by 50% in the last two decades (Schumann, Nichols X Lingston, 2002) and 25% to 30% of U.S. children between the ages of 6 and 17 are obese (Moran, 1999). Several studies show that sedentary activities such as television viewing, using a computer, and playing video games increase the risk of childhood obesity (Ebbeling, Pawlak & Ludwig, 2002; Dennison, Erb & Jenkins, 2002; Yackel, 2003). An innovative means of reducing sedentary activity in children through the use of video 'exergames' or 'exertainment' is becoming a popular means of increasing physical activity in children. A limited number of studies show that 'exergames' can make a positive contribution to players'stress management, weight management, fitness, and health (Lieberman, 2006). More research is needed to determine if and how these interactive video games improve physical activity and overall health in children at high risk for obesity. Purpose. The purpose of this pilot study was to assess the effects of a four-week interactive video 'exertainment' program in underserved children, as part of an after-school program based on social cognitive theory. Method. Participants consisted of 58 children recruited from an existing after-school program in the San Bernardino City Unified School District. The participants were children ages 7-12 years of lower socioeconomic status living in Southern California. Pre- and post-assessments were made to see if there were improvements in attitude, self-efficacy, outcome expectations, body composition, cardiovascular endurance, body image, physical activity outside the intervention, absenteeism, and academic achievement. Analyses. Results from this study showed that there was a 16% decrease in resting heart rate from baseline to post-intervention for males (p= < =.001) and a 12.9% decrease in resting heart rate for females (p= < =.001). Average active heart rate decreased for all subjects post-intervention representing at 7.16% decrease for males (p=041) and 5.2% decrease for females ( p=053). Absenteeism rates improved significantly for students participating in the intervention. The mean number of days students were absent during the intervention (3.73, p=020) decreased compared to prior to starting the intervention (000, p=000). Academic scores showed significant improvements in the students' mean math performance while participating in the intervention (t=3.63, p=001) compared to non-participants (t=2.16, p=.042). The average percent body fat in males showed a non-significant decrease by less than 1% (-.89, p=.295). There were no significant changes on the other study variables. Application to Health Education. The 'U Got 2 Move It' program focused on promoting healthy lifestyle modifications in America's youth as a means of reducing the risk of obesity in underserved children by introducing an appealing format for activity--interactive video games in after-school programs. The results from this pilot test will serve as a model for health educators to partner with schools and community-based organizations to develop future health-related programs focusing on preventing or reducing the threat of obesity and related health problems in high risk children.",pq_id,33710735,proquest_dt,NA,"Young, Tammy L",2007,THES,NA,reviewer1,Ali
,Charlie: A New Robot Prototype For Improving Communication And Social Skills In Children With Autism And A New Single-Point Infrared Sensor Technique For Detecting Breathing And Heart Rate Remotely,"This research delivers a new, interactive game-playing robot named CHARLIE and a novel technique for remotely detecting breathing and heart rate using a single-point, thermal infrared sensor (IR). The robot is equipped with a head and two arms, each with two degrees of freedom, and a camera. We trained a human hands classifier and used this classifier along with a standard face classifier to create two autonomous interactive games: single-player (""Imitate Me, Imitate You"") and two-player (""Pass the Pose""). Further, we developed and implemented a suite of new interactive games in which the robot is teleoperated by remote control. Each of these features has been tested and validated through a field study including eight children diagnosed with autism and speech delays. Results from that study show that significant improvements in speech and social skills can be obtained when using CHARLIE with the methodology described herein. Moreover, gains in communication and social interaction are observed to generalize from child-to-robot to co-present others through the scaffolding of communication skills with the systematic approach developed for the study.  Additionally, we present a new IR system that continuously targets the sub-nasal region of the face and measures subtle temperature changes corresponding to breathing and cardiac pulse. This research makes four novel contributions: (1) A low-cost, field-tested robot for use in autism therapy, (2) a suite of interactive robot games, (3) a hand classifier created for performing hand detection during the interactive games, and (4) an IR sensor system which remotely collects temperatures and computes breathing and heart rate. Interactive robot CHARLIE is physically designed to be aesthetically appealing to young children between three and six years of age. The hard, wood and metal robot body is covered with a bright green, fuzzy material and additional padding so that it appears toylike and soft. Additionally, several structural features were included to ensure safety during interactive play and to enhance the robustness of the robot. Because children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often enjoy exploring new or interesting objects with their hands, the robot must be able to withstand a moderate amount of physical manipulation without causing injury to the child or damaging the robot or its components. CHARLIE plays five distinct interactive games that are designed to be entertaining to young children, appeal to children of varying developmental ability and promote increased speech and social skill through imitation and turn-taking.  Remote breathing and heart rate detection Stress is a compounding factor in autism therapy which can inhibit progress toward specific therapeutic goals. The ability to non-invasively detect physical indicators of increasing stress, especially when they can be correlated to specific activities and measured in terms of length and frequency, can relay important metrics about the antecedents that cause stress for a particular child and can be used to help automate the evaluation of a child's progress between sessions. Further, collecting and measuring critical physiological indicators such as breathing and heart rate can enable robots to adjust their behavior based on the perceived emotional, psychological or physical state of their user. The utility and acceptance of robots can be further increased when they are able to learn typical physiological patterns and use these patterns as a baseline for identifying anomalies or possible warning signs of various problems in their human users.  We present a new technique for remotely collecting and analyzing breathing and heart rates in real time using an autonomous, low cost infrared (IR) sensor system. This is accomplished by continuously targeting a high precision IR sensor, tracking changes in the sub-nasal skin surface temperature and employing a sinusoidal curve-fitting function, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to extract the breathing and heart rate from recorded temperatures.",pq_id,1540510743,proquest_dt,NA,"Boccanfuso, Laura",2013,THES,Ph.D.,reviewer1,Ali
,Decentralized Network Design,"Most overlay networks are designed by a centralized algorithm, which takes the participating nodes and returns a set of edges connecting the nodes. We study the possible results of decentralizing overlay network design. What would happen if the individual nodes in the network were asked to choose their own connections? We use techniques from game theory to consider issues such as the stability and fairness of the resulting networks. We define and study several games, all with relevant applications.   First, we study variants of the Bounded Budget Connection (BBC) game, in which each node has some budget to spend on outgoing links and wants to minimize its distance to other nodes in the network. The BBC game has applications in social networks as well as peer-to-peer and overlay networks. We show that this game does not always guarantee a stable network. However, if we allow nodes to fractionally purchase links, as in the fractional BBC game, then a stable solution always exists, although it may be hard to find. We give existence and hardness results for fractional BBC games, as well as for two other fractional games: the fractional Shortest Paths Problem (SPP) game, which is motivated by the routing behavior of Autonomous Systems on the internet using the Border Gateway Protocol, and the preference game, a very simple fractional game which is a specialization of both fractional BBC and fractional SPP games. We study a new equilibrium solution concept for matrix games, called personalized equilibria, which generalizes all of these fractional games as well as modeling scenarios where players can choose how to combine other players' actions to suit their individual interests. Finally, we study the interaction between a centralized algorithm placing resources in the network and nodes choosing their own edges or routes – a variant of multicommodity facility location in which clients pay the cost of a minimum group Steiner tree connecting them to commodities of interest.",pq_id,304966110,proquest_dt,NA,"Ma, Laura Jane Poplawski",2009,THES,Ph.D.,reviewer1,Ali
,Hierarchical Goal Networks: Formalisms And Algorithms For Planning And Acting,"In real-world applications of AI and automation such as in robotics, computer game playing and web-services, agents need to make decisions in unstructured environments that are open-world, dynamic and partially observable. In the AI and Robotics research communities in particular, there is much interest in equipping robots to operate with minimal human intervention in diverse scenarios such as in manufacturing plants, homes, hospitals, etc. Enabling agents to operate in these environments requires advanced planning and acting capabilities, some of which are not well supported by the current state of the art automated planning formalisms and algorithms. To address this problem, in my thesis I propose a new planning formalism that addresses some of the inadequacies in current planning frameworks, and a suite of planning and acting algorithms that operate under this planning framework.   The main contributions of this thesis are: - Hierarchical Goal Network (HGN) Planning Formalism. This planning  formalism combines aspects (and therefore harnesses advantages) of Classical Planning and Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) Planning, two of the most prominent planning formalisms currently in use. In particular, HGN planning algorithms, while retaining the efficiency and scalability advantages of HTNs, also allows incorporation of heuristics and other reasoning techniques from Classical Planning. -  Planning Algorithms. Goal Decomposition  Planner (GDP) and the Goal Decomposition with Landmarks (GoDeL) planner are two HGN planning algorithms that combines hierarchical decomposition with classical planning heuristics to outperform state-of-the-art HTN planners like SHOP and SHOP2. -  Integration with Robotics. The Combined HGN and Motion Planning (CHaMP) algorithm integrates GoDeL with low-level motion and manipulation planning algorithms in Robotics to generate plans directly executable by robots.   Given the need for autonomous agents to operate in open, dynamic and unstructured environments and the obvious need for high-level deliberation capabilities to enable intelligent behavior, the planning-and-acting systems that are developed as part of this thesis may provide unique insights into ways to realize these systems in the real world.",pq_id,1708665164,proquest_dt,NA,"Shivashankar, Vikas",2015,THES,Ph.D.,reviewer1,Ali
,Human Control Of Cooperating Robots,"Advances in robotic technologies and artificial intelligence are allowing robots to emerge from research laboratories into our lives. Experiences with field applications show that we have underestimated the importance of human-robot interaction (HRI) and that new problems arise in HRI as robotic technologies expand. This thesis classifies HRI along four dimensions—human, robot, task, and world and illustrates that previous HRI classifications can be successfully interpreted as either about one of these elements or about the relationship between two or more of these elements. Current HRI studies of single-operator single-robot (SOSR) control and single-operator multiple-robots (SOMR) control are reviewed using this approach.    Human control of multiple robots has been suggested as a way to improve effectiveness in robot control. Unlike previous studies that investigated human interaction either in low-fidelity simulations or based on simple tasks, this thesis investigates human interaction with cooperating robot teams within a realistically complex environment. USARSim, a high-fidelity game-engine-based robot simulator, and MrCS, a distributed multirobot control system, were developed for this purpose. In the pilot experiment, we studied the impact of autonomy level. Mixed initiative control yielded performance superior to fully autonomous and manual control.    To avoid limitation to particular application fields, the present thesis focuses on common HRI evaluations that enable us to analyze HRI effectiveness and guide HRI design independently of the robotic system or application domain. We introduce the interaction episode (IEP), which was inspired by our pilot human-multirobot control experiment, to extend the Neglect Tolerance model to support general multiple robots control for complex tasks. Cooperation Effort (CE), Cooperation Demand (CD), and Team Attention Demand (TAD) are defined to measure the cooperation in SOMR control. Two validation experiments were conducted to validate the CD measurement under tight and weak cooperation conditions in a high-fidelity virtual environment. The results show that CD, as a generic HRI metric, is able to account for the various factors that affect HRI and can be used in HRI evaluation and analysis.",pq_id,304839847,proquest_dt,NA,"Wang, Jijun",2007,THES,Ph.D.,reviewer1,Ali
,On Fundamental Performance Limits Of Delay-Sensitive Wireless Communications,"Mobile traffic is expected to grow at an annual compound rate of 57% from 2014 to 2019, while among the data types that account for this growth mobile video has the highest growth rate. Since a significant portion of mobile video traffic is delay-sensitive, delay-sensitive traffic will play a critical role in future wireless communications. Consequently, future mobile wireless systems will face the dual challenge of supporting large traffic volume while providing reliable service for various kinds of delay-sensitive applications (e.g. real-time conversational video, voice-over-IP (VoIP), and online gaming). Past work on delay-sensitive wireless communications has generally overlooked physical-layer considerations such as modulation and coding scheme (MCS), probability of decoding error, and code blocklength (or coding delay) by employing oversimplified models for the physical-layer. In this dissertation we aim to bridge information theory, communication theory and queueing theory by jointly considering the queueing delay violation probability and the probability of decoding error to identify fundamental trade-offs among wireless system parameters such as MCS, code blocklength, user perceived quality of service, channel fading speed, and average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).    Throughout this dissertation we focus on wireless communication systems where the channel state information (CSI) is available only at the receiver. We model the underlying wireless channel by a finite-state Markov chain (FSMC) where state transitions happen at each transport block (TB) transmission (i.e. TB-based FSMC). First, we focus on communication schemes without feedback and derive the dispersion of the TB-based FSMC model of the Rayleigh fading channel. The TB-based FSMC dispersion is used to characterize the maximum achievable throughput under probability of decoding error and coding delay constraints for a given modulation scheme. Second, we focus on communication schemes with one bit decision-feedback (e.g. acknowledge (ACK)). We introduce a communication scheme, namely early decoding, where the receiver determines the decoding time based on the available CSI. We characterize the maximum achievable throughput of the early decoding scheme under probability of decoding error and coding delay constraints for a given modulation scheme. Then, we derive the dispersion of parallel additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels with finite discrete input alphabets (e.g. pulse amplitude modulation (PAM)). The dispersion of parallel AWGN channels is used to track the operation of incremental redundancy type hybrid automatic repeat request (IR-HARQ) over the Rayleigh fading channel through the HARQ Markov model (HARQ-MM), introduced here. We use the HARQ-MM to characterize the maximum achievable (average) throughput of IR-HARQ under probability of decoding error and coding delay constraints for a given MCS. Third, we focus on a queueing system where data packets arrive at the transmitter, wait in the queue, and are transmitted over the Rayleigh fading channel with IR-HARQ. We invoke a two-dimensional discrete-time Markov process and develop a recursive algorithm to characterize the maximum achievable (average) system throughput for a given MCS under queueing delay violation probability, and probability of decoding error constraints.",pq_id,1753889566,proquest_dt,NA,"Sahin, Cenk",2015,THES,Ph.D.,reviewer1,Ali
,Rain In Vision And Graphics,"Rain produces sharp intensity fluctuations in images and videos which severely degrade the performance of outdoor vision systems. Removing the visual effects of rain is therefore important in order to make outdoor vision robust to rain. In contrast, in graphics, rain effects are desirable as they are often used to convey scene emotions in movies and in other graphics applications, such as games, to enhance realism. Developing efficient algorithms for realistic rendering of rain effects is however challenging. This thesis, studies rain from the perspective of vision and graphics. We have two main goals - (1) to understand the visual appearance of rain and (2) to develop efficient algorithms both for handling its effects in vision and for its realistic rendering in graphics.    We begin by modeling the visual appearance of rain. We describe the appearance by modeling the photometric intensities produced by individual raindrops and the space-time correlation produced by the motion of a large number of rain drops. We then use these appearance models to develop two complementary approaches to handle the effects of rain on vision systems. The first approach uses a post-processing algorithm for detection and removal of rain from videos that have already been captured. In the second approach we use our appearance model to show that the unique physical properties of rain—its small size, high velocity and spatial distribution—makes its visibility depend strongly on camera parameters. This dependence is used to reduce the visibility of rain during image acquisition by judiciously selecting camera parameters. Conversely, camera parameters can also be chosen to enhance the visibility of rain. This ability can be used to develop an inexpensive and portable camera-based rain gauge that provides instantaneous rain-rate measurements.    In graphics, we have developed two models for realistic rendering of rain. In the first model we consider the complex appearance patterns produced by close by raindrops. We show that these patterns are produced due to the rapid shape distortions (i.e. oscillations) that a raindrop undergoes as it falls and develop a physics-based model to faithfully render these complex appearance patterns. This model is then used to develop an efficient algorithm for rendering rain in images and videos. In the second work, we focus on realistic rendering of material-dependent splashing of raindrops. Here we measure raindrop splashes for 22 different realworld materials. These measurements are then used to build a compact stochastic model that accurately captures the material and inclination dependent splashing behavior of raindrops. Additionally, it allows a user to render physically plausible splashes for novel materials that have not been measured. These two methods have advanced the state of the art algorithms for rendering rain. We believe that this thesis presents a new approach for modeling dynamic weather effects and has opened new avenues for research in vision and graphics.",pq_id,304653149,proquest_dt,NA,"Garg, Kshitiz",2008,THES,Ph.D.,reviewer1,Ali
,"Robot Motion Planning For Tracking And Capturing Adversarial, Cooperative And Independent Targets","The last ten years have seen robots become smaller, lighter and more maneuverable than ever before, paving the way for their use in the service sector, and even in our homes. A key aspect that elevates a network of robots over a bed of sensors is the ability of individual units to autonomously navigate, forming a sensor-actuator network. These added degrees of freedom demand that we revisit existing motion planning and navigation algorithms and extend them to be able to better contribute to the services they are designed to provide.   In deploying autonomous robots away from laboratory-controlled settings and in to real-world environments, care must be taken because they share their space with other autonomous agents. For instance, a typical home robot has to account for people as well as their pets. Imparting a fair degree of autonomy to robot navigation tasks thus requires reasoning about the mobility of other entities in the path-planning process. This is not a trivial task because such agents can not often be easily characterized or quantified, e.g. human navigation depends on many factors including the perception of hazards, experience from long-term memory, even whim.   In this thesis, we take a deep look at the role of the information available to path-planning algorithms in the context of the mobile target-tracking problem. We start with the problem formulation (Chapter 2), in which robots need to keep track of a single mobile target for as long a duration of time as possible. In the game-theoretic sense, the information available to the target has a different characteristic than the information available to the robots. For example, target behavior varies from adversarial ones in defense applications to cooperative ones in service applications. In the chapters that follow, we present the main contributions of this thesis with this role of information during the path-planning process being the common thread.   Traditional surveillance applications assume the worst-case – the target is an adversary actively trying to escape from the robots. We model this strategic interaction with the theory of pursuit-evasion games, wherein a robot pursues a target, which in turn tries to evade it. We study a mathematical variant of the Lion and Man game in the presence of an obstacle, and show that the final outcome of whether the lion can track down the man depends, in closed form, on the initial conditions (Chapter 3). We derive optimal player strategies that work regardless of what the other player does, thus providing the worst-case guarantees that such applications demand.   At the opposite end of the spectrum, there exist service applications where the target’s trajectory is known to the robots before they need to move. Our motivating example is mobile telepresence, or virtual presence – an emerging technology that enables people to participate in environments they are not physically present in. Specifically, we present a navigation algorithm for a first-of-its-kind person-following robot with telepresence and monitoring applications (Chapter 4). We require that in the presence of another person, the robot should ensure a safe distance by following that person’s path without losing track. We present a heuristic planning approach that accounts for both non-holonomic constraints and trajectory smoothness. Further, a control-theoretic implementation is provided.   Targets that navigate autonomously usually do so with their own intentions. While it is uncertain how they navigate, their behavior may neither be adversarial, nor completely known to the robots in advance. We present a novel data-driven probabilistic mobility model that can be used by path planners to reason about the uncertainties in decisions made by an individual who is navigating in an indoor environment (Chapter 6). We show that it is possible to preserve long temporal histories over an abstracted representation of the environment, which helps predict future mobility of the target better than previous approaches. We present a multi-robot planning algorithm that builds off of this model. Although our algorithm is designed for long-term planning and offline solution, we are able to execute the robot paths in real-time, and demonstrate extended utility with simulations. We discuss the architecture of a complete system implementation for the telepresence application, including both hardware design and software development (Chapter 8). With an increasing aging population in the U.S., it is our belief that such a system would become relevant in the near future, e.g., to assisted living facilities for purposes of healthcare monitoring.",pq_id,1731272778,proquest_dt,NA,"Karnad, Nikhil",2015,THES,Ph.D.,reviewer1,Ali
,The Interplay Between Networks And Robotics: Networked Robots And Robotic Routers,"In this work, we explore the interplay between robotics and networks. Robots can benefit from an embedded network and also the network can benefit from the mobility of the robots.   We investigate the design space where the application is oriented towards robotics or networking, considering how much information about the environment is provided and what the sensing capabilities are.   At one end, the robots can benefit from the resources of an environment-embedded network, in which robot sensing and communication is enhanced by the network. We consider the design and implementation of practical pursuit-evasion games with networked robots, where a communication network provides sensing-at-a-distance as well as a communication backbone that enables tighter coordination between pursuers. Using the theory of zero-sum games, we develop an algorithm that computes the minimal completion time strategy for multi-pursuit multi-evasion when all players make optimal decisions based on complete knowledge. We then describe the design of a real-world mobile robot-based pursuit evasion game. We validate our algorithms by experiments in a moderate-scale testbed in a challenging office environment.   We then show that the network can also benefit from Robotics by taking advance of micro and macro motion. Robots can mitigate multi-path fading. We design a system that allows robots to cooperate and improve the real-world network throughput via a distributed cooperation framework. A mobile wireless network can also be quickly and autonomously deployed in urban search and rescue efforts, forming a communication substrate. We study the problem of determining the minimum number of mobile robots and how to position them so all clients are connected. Our approach to the problem is based on virtual potential fields where we treat each client as a virtual charged particle. We validate our algorithm with physical robots in an indoor environment and demonstrate that we are able to get feasible solutions.",pq_id,847028622,proquest_dt,NA,"Vieira, Marcos Augusto Menezes",2010,THES,Ph.D.,reviewer1,Ali
,The Large Scale Peer-To-Peer (P2p) Live Streaming In The Internet,"A large number of emerging applications such as IPTV, event broadcast, online games and distance learning require the support of live video streaming, yet, this is perhaps the greatest unfulfilled promise of the Internet. The root of the problem is that the Internet by nature, i.e., autonomous, heterogeneous, best-effort, can not provide the services required by streaming applications. The recent development in Peer-to-Peer (P2P) technologies brings new momentum in live video streaming due to the inherent self-scaling property and easy deployment. In spite of its popularity, there is no consensus on how a large-scale P2P live streaming system works. There are two fundamental problems in the design space: topology formulation that relates to how a peer locates the video content from one another and content delivery. Further, there has been little study on the design trade-offs and large-scale measurements. This thesis fills this gap.    We leverage our earlier system, Coolstreaming, which was arguably the earliest large-scale P2P video streaming experiment and was widely referenced in the community as the benchmark (Google entries top 400,000). We have designed and implemented comprehensive logging tools to collect and analyze large sets of traces from real-world broadcasts, from which we establish a theoretical framework that (1) concretely demonstrate the fundamental system design trade-offs and further identify the main performance bottlenecks and key factors behind them. Specifically, we show (1) random topology formulation can lead to convergence and stability; (2) video streaming performance is critically affected by system dynamics, in particular churns; (3) the system exhibits excellent scaling property yet the uploading capacity contributions from peers are highly skewed, in which a small percentage of peers conbtribute most; (4) the scale and streaming performance is largely determined by how well the system can handle the flash crowd in live streaming event.",pq_id,304812003,proquest_dt,NA,"Xie, Susu",2008,THES,Ph.D.,reviewer1,Ali
,A Study Of Reported Satisfaction With Differentially Aggressive Computer Games Amongst Incarcerated Young Offenders.,"Investigated the satisfaction reported by young offenders following the playing of 2 interactive computer games requiring identical skills but involving differing levels of perceived aggression and planning for successful completion. Questionnaires and measures of self-esteem were administered to 72 incarcerated young offenders aged 15–18 yrs. 40 of these Ss had a record of violent offending. Ss' responses were compared to a control group of 30 young, male non-offenders. Ss were asked to play 2 short computer games, and to rate their satisfaction with both. The results indicate that the computer game which involved pattern planning to achieve success was reported as being less satisfying than that which simply required the ""destruction"" of objects. Further, between group differences were obtained on game satisfaction and self esteem scores.

,College Men’s Psychological And Physiological Responses Associated With Violent Video Game Play. Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B.,"Research suggests that playing violent video games increases the likelihood of aggression. However, less clear is how individual characteristics influence the mechanisms that lead to aggression. Using Anderson and Bushman’s (2002) General Aggression Model as a framework, the present study examined the independent and joint effects of individual differences and situational factors on affective and physiological reactivity to playing a violent video game. One hundred thirty-three participants completed self-report measures of trait aggression and violent video game exposure. They were randomly assigned to groups instructed to play a video game using either violent or nonviolent strategies while facial electromyography, heart rate, and electrodermal activity were measured. Positive and negative affect was assessed via self-report prior to and following video game play. It was hypothesized that trait aggression and level of past exposure to violent video games would be positively related to increases in physiological arousal and negative affect among participants in a violent, relative to a nonviolent, condition. Hierarchical regression analyses failed to detect a significant relationship between trait aggression and changes in heart rate, facial electromyography, or self-reported affect as a function of game condition. However, significant positive relationships were found between trait aggression and skin conductance, but only in the nonviolent condition. Analyses revealed that past exposure to violent video games was positively related to increased skin conductance among participants in the non-violent, but not the violent video game condition. Past exposure to violent video games was also positively related to increased heart rate, but this was among participants in the violent, but not the non-violent condition. Significant relationships between past exposure to violent video games and changes in facial electromyography and self-reported affect as a function of video game condition were not found. Findings are discussed in terms of how trait aggression and past exposure to violent video games influence arousal, and potentially, the likelihood of aggressive behavior.",no_id,anderson2010_58,anderson2010,"Powell, C.

Ss then played a violent or nonviolent video game for 8 min and were then administered the Rosenzweig Picture-Frustration Study. Ss who played the violent video game exhibited fewer defensive fantasies and tended to exhibit more assertive or need-persistent fantasies than did Ss who played the nonviolent game. For nonaggressive females, the barrier responsible for frustration was more salient in their fantasies after playing the violent video game. Results suggest that aggression in the context of a video game discharges children's aggressive impulses in a socially acceptable way, leaving the children less defensive and more assertive.

,Effects Of Videogame Play In Boys: An Examination Of Adrenocortical Activity And Behavior. Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B.,"This study sought to extend the literature on the effects of videogame play in young children, as well as extend and support the developmental psychobiological literature on cortisol-stress response in young children, including its relation to age and temperament. Cortisol levels, aggression, attention, and compliance were measured before and after play with a non-violent videogame for the treatment group, and before and after a children''s television program for the control group. Participants were 75 typically developing 5 to 7 year-old boys with videogame play experience, and their families. Children participated in a 1-½ hour laboratory session that included pre and posttest measures of salivary cortisol, free-play, and attention. A posttest interview was also administered to measure levels of interpersonal aggression. Parents completed three surveys: The Child Behavior Questionnaire (Ahadi, Rothbart, & Ye, 1993); The Child Behavior Checklist (Achenbach, & Edelbrock, 1981); and a demographic questionnaire. Parents also completed a posttest phone interview to assess child non-compliance. Data reported here confirm that boys who played routine, non-violent videogames demonstrated a significant increase in observable levels of object aggression immediately after videogame play, as well as an increase in non-compliance to parental requests for several hours after videogame play. In support of previous research (e.g., Davis, Donzella, Krueger, & Gunnar, 1999), children who scored higher on the temperamental dimension of surgency/extraversion exhibited significantly higher levels of cortisol two hours-posttest than non-surgent children. Boys in the videogame condition had higher levels of cortisol than boys in the control condition two hours posttest, but this effect was independent of temperamental profile, and did not reflect a within subject increase in cortisol. Contrary to expectations, older, not younger, children demonstrated increased levels of aggression, younger boys did not differ from older boys on levels of cortisol, and attention was not compromised by videogame play. The behavioral effects of videogame play warrant precautionary measures for surgent and non-surgent children with regard to routine videogame exposure. Suggestions for future researchers include longer-term follow-up, expansion of age ranges, and greater numbers of cortisol collections.",no_id,anderson2010_104,anderson2010,"Fulgham, L. M. (2003).

,"Favaro, P. J. (1983). The Effects Of Video Game Play On Mood, Physiological Arousal And Psychomotor Performance (Unpublished Doctoral Dissertation). Hofstra University.","The effects of computer video game play have been a controversial topic actively pursued by the media. Although psychologists, medical experts and the Surgeon General have suggested that the games cause various deleterious effects on social behavior, while others believe that the games can produce beneficial effects in the form of transfer of training, no research has been done to investigate these questions in an experimental setting. The present study examines three major questions that have been raised about video game play. The first question centers on the possible negative effects caused by playing some video games which are aggressive in theme content. The second question centers around whether or not the games produce unhealthy changes in physiological arousal. The third question focuses on whether possible benefits such as improved eye-hand coodination, can be brought on by video game play. Independent variables in this study were activity (video game play vs. television watching vs. dart game play); aggressive theme content (high vs. low); and time on task (fifteen minutes vs. one half hour). Dependent variables were mood, physiological arousal and performance ability as a function of manipulative aptitude. Subjects were 72 college undergraduates and the design was a 3 x 2 x 2 factorial design. No hypotheses were made because of the lack of experimental data on which to base theories. Data analysis was subject to a strict set of conventions designed to reduce the dangers inherent in post-hoc analyses. The major finding of the study suggested that video game play and television watching are not as similar as some have suggested. While all aggressive conditions produced increased self-reports of hostility, the high aggression video game condition produced less aggression than the low aggressive television condition. The aggressive dart game group showed highest self-reports of hostility. No effects were found for transfer to a performance task. A significant theme by time on task interaction was found for heart rate suggesting that high aggression for short time periods increased physiological arousal, which decreases under high time on task. Results of the study were used to examine catharsis, arousal and social learning models of aggression. Issues concerning the social scientist''s responsibility in the media, changes brought about by technology and future research models for studying computer games are discussed.",no_id,anderson2010_29,anderson2010,"Favaro, P.

,The Effects Of Video Game Violence On Boys’ Articulated Thoughts Of Aggressive Behavioral Intentions. Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B.,"Violent video game exposure is correlated with increased aggressive behavior, decreased academic achievement, decreased leisure activities, decreased self-esteem, and delinquent behavior in children and adults (Anderson, 2004; Anderson & Dill, 2000; Dill & Dill, 1998; Emes, 1997; Funk & Buchman, 1996; Graybill, Kirsch, & Kesselmann, 1985; Irwin & Gross, 1995; Scott, 1995; Van Schie & Weigman, 1997). However, only a few researchers have examined the causal effects of video game violence on children and most of these studies are out-dated. Experimental research with adult populations indicates that violent video game play negatively impacts the emotional state and the cognitive mediation of aggressive behavior. However, the impact of today''s violent video games on children is not known. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of violent video games on boys'' mood and articulated thoughts of aggressive behavior and hostile intent attributions in an experimental setting. Fifty pre-teen boys between the ages of 9 to 12 were randomly assigned to play either a violent or a non-violent video game. The results revealed that the type of video game did not impact spontaneous verbalizations of aggressive behavioral intentions, hostile intent attributions, or negative emotions. However, the boys who played the violent video game evinced increased negative affect following video game play compared to the control group who evinced decreased negative affect following video game play. Study limitations, implications of the mood finding and suggestions for future research are discussed.",no_id,anderson2010_139,anderson2010,"Pusateri, J. (2006).

,Trait Aggression And Style Of Video Game Play: The Effects Of Violent Video Game Play On Aggressive Thoughts. Dissertation Abstracts International: Section A.,"This study examined whether males (N = 66) who play a violent video game (24: The Game) are more likely to form aggressive thoughts than males who play a nonviolent game (Tetris), and furthermore, whether this tendency to form aggressive thoughts is moderated by trait aggression, such that those with high levels of this personality trait would reliably report more aggressive thoughts. Players’ style of video game play (very aggressive versus less aggressive) was considered as well. Results indicated that, as predicted, participants who played the violent video game produced more aggressive thoughts than those who played the nonviolent game; however, contrary to our hypothesis, trait aggression did not moderate this relationship; i.e., the effects on playing the violent video game on aggressive cognitions were not statistically larger (or smaller) for those participants who scored high on the trait aggression index than for those who scored low. Using data obtained by measuring participants’ playing style during while playing 24: The Game, the results reveal that individuals do, indeed, tend to play video games, at least violent video games, in relatively different ways; in fact, the number of inPREVIEW vi game violent acts committed by players varied substantially (from a low of 57 acts to a high of 255 acts). Subsequent analyses indicated that participants’ level of trait aggression did not influence the style of video game play used (more aggressive versus less aggressive). However, results also indicated that a more aggressive playing style did, in fact, predict aggressive thoughts. Drawing on the theories of neo-associationism and GAM, this study offers an innovative approach to gaming research by considering one’s in-game aggressive playing style as well as individual difference variables (i.e. trait aggressiveness) in investigating the aggressive outcomes of violent video game play",no_id,anderson2010_57,anderson2010,"Paradise, A.

,"Video Games And Children: Effects On Leisure Activities, Schoolwork, And Peer Involvement.","Examined the effects of home videogame systems on daily activities for 64 children (aged 9–16 yrs) over a 5-mo period. Three groups were contrasted: a new game group (n = 22), who received a home videogame system in December; an old game group (n = 25), who had owned a videogame for a year; and a no game group (n = 17), who did not own a videogame system. Ss responded to questionnaires about their leisure activities, their school work, and their peer interactions, in both November and March. The new game Ss received an additional assessment in January, 3 wks after 1st receiving their videogame. Results show that an initial high involvement with the videogame soon dropped off. Early decreases in leisure activities (TV, for example) also soon disappeared. School activities and peer involvement were not affected at any point. It is concluded that owning a videogame does not greatly alter a child's activities.

,"""Baby On Board"": Reducing Risk Taking In Adult Drivers In A Simulated Driving Game","Two studies examined the effects of different socio-affective factors on risk driving behaviour. In Experiment 1, 87 adult drivers we asked to play a computer-based driving game after being exposed to a series of images that depicted infants, police or neutral information (control condition). In Experiment 2 we tested a further 60 adult drivers. We found a significant effect of our manipulation on driving behaviour, with performance being significantly less risky in the infant condition than in the police and control conditions. In addition, this advantage was not simply due to variations in emotions typically associated with infant pictures. The results of this study highlight the importance of studying the role of socio-affective context when investigating factors that influence driving behaviour. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.aap.2012.06.031,Scopus,Accident Analysis and Prevention,"Mammarella N., Fairfield B., Di Domenico A., Di Fiore T.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,"""Bouncing Back"" From A Loss: Entrepreneurial Orientation, Emotions, And Failure Narratives","In this study, we explore how failure in the form of the first lost game of the college football season for a team influences specific content within the narratives constructed regarding that loss and how those narratives are associated with subsequent performance. Building on theoretical perspectives regarding sports management, entrepreneurial orientation (EO), emotions, and the use of narratives for sensemaking, we develop and test an EO-related sports management model of failure narratives. Using computer-aided text analysis of transcripts from head coaches' press conferences directly following their team's first loss of the season as well as regression analysis, we found that the narrative's EO content has a U-shaped relationship with subsequent (i.e., next game) performance. Additionally, negative emotional content had a similar U-shaped relationship with subsequent performance. Finally, positive emotional content exhibited an inverse U-shaped relationship with subsequent performance. We discuss the implications of these results on the literatures regarding EO, emotions, and sports management as well as possible avenues for future research. © 2013 Baylor University.",doi,10.1111/etap.12057,Scopus,Entrepreneurship: Theory and Practice,"Wolfe M.T., Shepherd D.A.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,"""I Know That You Know How I Feel"": Behavioral And Physiological Signals Demonstrate Emotional Attunement While Interacting With A Computer Simulating Emotional Intelligence","Human-human communication studies have suggested that within communicative interactions, individuals acknowledge each other as intentional agents and adjust their emotion nonverbal behavior according to the other. This process has been defined as emotional attunement. In this study, we examine the emotional attunement process in the context of affective human-computer interactions. To this purpose, participants were exposed to one of two conditions. In one case, they played with a computer that simulated understanding of their emotional reactions while guiding them across four different game-like activities; in the other, the computer guided participants across the activities without mentioning any ability to understand emotional responses. Face movements, gaze direction, posture, vocal behavior, electrocardiogram and electrodermal activity were simultaneously recorded during the experimental sessions. Results showed that if participants were aware of interacting with an agent able to recognize their emotions, they reported that the computer was able to ""understand"" them and showed a higher number of nonverbal behaviors during the most interactive activity.

,"""Just Dance"": The Effects Of Exergame Feedback And Controller Use On Physical Activity And Psychological Outcomes","Objective: In Asia, dance games are among the most popular types of exergames. Whereas traditional dance-based games emphasize step movements on a dance pad, more recent dance games emphasize intuitive dance movements using simple controllers or players' own bodies to ""just dance."" However, because of limited space and access, young adults in Taiwan often do not use these games. Popular dance videos on YouTube are more readily available to students because these videos can be accessed on a computer. Therefore, the current study examines the effects of interactivity (the role of feedback) and controller use on participants' physiological and psychological outcomes during exergames. Materials and Methods: The dance game ""Just Dance 3"" (Ubisoft, Montreuil, France) was chosen as the stimulus for this study. Participants danced through one song for rehearsal and warm-up, followed by three songs for the experiment, which lasted approximately 12 minutes. One hundred twenty-nine college students participated in a 2×2×2 (interactivity, feedback versus no feedback; controller, with versus without; sex, male versus female) between-subject factorial design. Results: A series of 2×2×2 (interactivity, controller, and sex) analyses of variance showed no significant differences in interaction effects on participants' heart rates, blood pressures, body movements, step counts, or perceived psychological outcomes. Conclusions: Dance game videos without feedback are also effective tools for achieving moderate-level exercise intensity. These videos can supplement the limited access to games in Asian countries, such as Taiwan. © Copyright 2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2015.",doi,10.1089/g4h.2014.0092,Scopus,Games for Health Journal,Lin J.-H.,2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,[Effect Of Mental And Physical Stress On Intraocular Pressure--A Pilot Study].,"The aim of the present study was to examine the influence of phasic stressors on intraocular pressure (IOP). We exposed 15 ophthalmologically and systemically healthy non-smoking subjects (m:f = 8:7; mean age 25.4 years) to both bicycle ergometry physical stress and a computer-game psychological stress. IOP, blood pressure, and subjective stress were measured. To adjust for between-subject variance, we calculated intra-subject z-scores based on IOP values. Because of the habituation occurring during repeated tonometric measurements, we tested the significance of the difference between the observed and expected IOP z-values for each of the stressors. The expected IOP value was the mean of the pre- and post-stress relaxation-period values. Student's t-tests were used to assess the impact of the stressors on blood pressure. Both stressors increased the systolic blood pressure, but only under mental stress was the intraocular-pressure increase statistically significant (p = 0.048). The selective increase in intraocular pressure during mental stress by similar reaction of blood pressure to both stressors is a hint for possible different regulation circuits in the autonomic nerve system for intraocular- and blood pressure, respectively. Additionally, it was possible to demonstrate that mental stress could lead to a rise in intraocular pressure.",doi,10.1055/s-2008-1034878,pubmed,Klinische Monatsblatter fur Augenheilkunde,"Erb, C; Brody, S; Rau, H",1998,NA,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,30: 2: A Game Designed To Promote The Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Protocol,"Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a first-aid key survival technique used to stimulate breathing and keep blood flowing to the heart. Its effective administration can significantly increase the survival chances of cardiac arrest victims. We propose 30: 2, a videogame designed to introduce the main steps of the CPR protocol. It is not intended for certification and training purpose. Driven by the 2010 European Resuscitation Council guidelines we have designed a game composed of eight mini games corresponding to the main steps of the protocol. The player acts as a helper and has to solve a different challenge. We present a detailed description of the game creation process presenting the requirements, the design decisions, and the implementation details. In addition, we present some first impressions of our testing users (25 children, five of each age from 8 to 12 years old and 12 males and 13 females). We evaluated clarity of instructions and three settings of the game: the aesthetics of scenarios, the playability, and the enjoyability of each mini game. All games were well punctuated, and there are no significantly differences between their sex. The proposed game can be a suitable tool to disseminate and promote CPR knowledge. © 2016 Imma Boada et al.",doi,10.1155/2016/8251461,Scopus,International Journal of Computer Games Technology,"Boada I., Rodriguez-Benitez A., Garcia-Gonzalez J.M., Thió-Henestrosa S., Sbert M.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,A Breath Biofeedback Computer Game For Children With Cystic Fibrosis,"The authors sought to develop and test a breath-controlled video game using a digital spirometer that, by providing visual breath biofeedback, could promote awareness of breathing techniques in children with cystic fibrosis (CF). To assess improvement in game performance during hospitalizations for CF exacerbations, the authors conducted a trial on 10 inpatients. Subjects had at least five 15-minute exposures to a breath biofeedback game that challenged them to track a moving target using their breath. Subjects reacted positively to the breath tracking challenge. Repeated-measures analysis of variance of a tracking fidelity statistic showed improvement in eye-breath coordination over 5 sessions (P =.026). It was concluded that an electronic breath game is safe and can improve breath awareness among children with CF. This technology could also contribute to awareness of respiratory symptoms and foster social ties among CF patients. © The Author(s) 2010.",doi,10.1177/0009922809348022,Scopus,Clinical Pediatrics,"Bingham P.M., Bates J.H.T., Thompson-Figueroa J., Lahiri T.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,A Case Study Of Autonomy And Motivation In A Student-Led Game Development Project,"This paper presents the findings of an exploratory case study into the relationship between student autonomy and motivation in project based learning, using Self-Determination Theory (SDT) to frame the investigation. The case study explores how different forms of motivation affect the students’ response to challenges and their intention to complete the project. Earlier studies have made little explicit use of theoretical perspectives on student autonomy and motivation, a weakness this study attempts to address. As an exploratory case study seeking to evaluate the suitability of a particular theoretical framework, we chose a small case: three students on a one-term computer games development project. Given the small scale, the approach is necessarily qualitative, drawing on project documentation and one-to-one interviews with the students. Our conclusion is that the concepts of SDT provide a useful framework for analysing students’ motivations to undertake project work, and its predictions can offer useful guidance on how to initiate and supervise such projects. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",doi,10.1080/08993408.2016.1210854,Scopus,Computer Science Education,"Prigmore M., Taylor R., De Luca D.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,A Computer Program For Studying Blood Gases In Respiratory Care,"We developed a computer program in a style of a game to help study blood gases in respiratory care. The program generates five simulated patients from a pool of 11. The player selects one patient, then the program calculates the patient's condition according to initial condition and selected treatment. Condition of the simulated patient may improve or deteriorate accordingly. Every two hours, the program display the data, requests the diagnosis and asks addition/change of treatment. The program then judges if diagnosis is correct. This process is repeated up to 48 hours. Finally a score and comments are displayed according to the performance of the patient and of the player. Students and young physicians used the original disk 312 times and more than 30 copies are distributed throughout the country.

,A Framework For Foresighted Resource Reciprocation In P2p Networks,"We consider peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, where multiple peers are interested in sharing multimedia content. In such P2P networks, the shared resources are the peers' contributed content and their upload bandwidth. While sharing resources, autonomous and self-interested peers need to make decisions on the amount of their resource reciprocation (i.e., representing their actions) such that their individual utilities are maximized. We model the resource reciprocation among the peers as a stochastic game and show how the peers can determine optimal strategies for resource reciprocation using a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework. Unlike existing resource reciprocation strategies, which focus on myopic decisions of peers, the optimal strategies determined based on MDP enable the peers to make foresighted decisions about resource reciprocation, such that they can explicitly consider both their immediate as well as future expected utilities. To successfully formulate the MDP framework, we propose a novel algorithm that identifies the state transition probabilities using representative resource reciprocation models of peers. These models express the peers' different attitudes toward resource reciprocation. We analytically investigate how the error between the true and estimated state transition probability impacts each peer's decisions for selecting its actions as well as the resulting utilities. Moreover, we also analytically study how bounded rationality (e.g., limited memory for reciprocation history and the limited number of state descriptions) can impact the interactions among the peers and the resulting resource reciprocation. Simulation results show that the proposed approach based on reciprocation models can effectively cope with a dynamically changing environment such as peers' joining or leaving P2P networks. Moreover, we show that the proposed foresighted decisions lead to the best performance in terms of the cumulative expected utilities. © 1999-2012 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TMM.2008.2008925,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Multimedia,"Park H., Van Der Schaar M.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,A Fuzzy Physiological Approach For Continuously Modeling Emotion During Interaction With Play Technologies,"The popularity of computer games has exploded in recent years, yet methods of evaluating user emotional state during play experiences lag far behind. There are few methods of assessing emotional state, and even fewer methods of quantifying emotion during play. This paper presents a novel method for continuously modeling emotion using physiological data. A fuzzy logic model transformed four physiological signals into arousal and valence. A second fuzzy logic model transformed arousal and valence into five emotional states relevant to computer game play: boredom, challenge, excitement, frustration, and fun. Modeled emotions compared favorably with a manual approach, and the means were also evaluated with subjective self-reports, exhibiting the same trends as reported emotions for fun, boredom, and excitement. This approach provides a method for quantifying emotional states continuously during a play experience. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

,A Game For Emotional Regulation In Adolescents: The (Body) Interface Device Matters,"The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of the type of interface device in the efficacy of a serious game that teaches emotional regulation (ER) strategies in a non-clinical sample of adolescents. We conducted a between-participants experiment in which participants (N = 61) played a frustration induction game, and then an ER game (a breathing strategy game), using one of three types of devices (computer, smartphone, and RGB-D camera). Frustration mood and perceived arousal were the main variables measured. Results revealed a significant interaction between moment (pre-induction phase, post-induction phase, and regulation phase) and the type of interface device used in the frustration mood scores. In participants who used the computer and smartphone, frustration increased after the induction phase and decreased after the regulation phase. However, for participants who used the RGB-D camera, frustration decreased significantly after the induction phase, and this change was maintained after the regulation phase. Changes in arousal were similar with the three devices. This study highlights that the type of interface device (and specifically, the participation of the body) is a crucial variable in the efficacy of serious games affecting users' emotional experience. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

,A Game Theoretical Approach To Distributed Relay Selection In Randomized Cooperation,"In this paper, the problem of node management in the presence of randomized cooperation is tackled. First, game theory is exploited to model the problem of setting up a cluster of cooperative nodes in a wireless network as a multiplayer noncooperative game. In this game the set of players is made of all the nodes belonging to a potential relay cluster an d the set of actions for each player consists of two options only (characterized by different payoffs), namely transmitting a data packet or remaining silent. Then, a novel strategy for the management of node participation to a distributed cooperative link is derived. The proposed solution is fully distributed, is characterized by autonomous choices made by each potential relay and is of significant practical interest since it guarantees the participation of a proper number of nodes to a virtual antenna array (so avoiding an energy waste associated with an excessive number of cooperating nodes) without requiring any overhead for node management. © 2010 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TWC.2010.061810.091394,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications,"Sergi S., Vitetta G.M.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,A Low-Cost Cognitive Rehabilitation With A Commercial Video Game Improves Sustained Attention And Executive Functions In Multiple Sclerosis: A Pilot Study,"Objective. To evaluate the effectiveness of a home-based cognitive rehabilitation (CR) program based on the video game Dr Kawashima's Brain Training (DKBT; Nintendo, Japan), in improving attention, processing speed, and working memory of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Methods. This was a randomized, wait-list control study. Patients with MS and failure in at least one between Stroop Test (ST), Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT), and Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) were submitted to an 8-week home-based CR program playing DKBT. Patients were evaluated at baseline and after DKBT by the aforementioned tests, by the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) and by the MS Quality of Life-54 questionnaire (MSQoL-54). Results. Fifty-two 52 patients were screened for eligibility; 35 (mean [standard deviation] age of 43.9 [8.4] years, median Expanded Disability Status Scale score of 2.0 (range = 2.0-6.0) were randomly assigned to the intervention group (n = 18) or wait-list control group (n = 17). ANCOVA analysis showed a significant effect of DKBT on ST (F = 5.027; P =.034; F2 = 0.210), SDMT (F = 4.240; P =.049; F2 = 0.177), and on some subscales of MSQoL-54. The PASAT and cognitive subscale of MFIS also showed an improvement, but this was just not significant (F = 4.104, P =.054, F2 = 0.171, and F = 4.226, P =.054, F2 = 0.237, respectively). Conclusion.

,A Machine Consciousness Approach To The Design Of Human-Like Bots,"This chapter introduces Machine Consciousness as a new research field applied to the development of human-like behaviour of non-player characters (NPCs) in video games. Key aspects, advantages, and challenges of this young research area are discussed using the cognitive architecture CERA-CRANIUM as an illustrative example of an autonomous control system inspired by cognitive theories of human consciousness. Additionally, other cognitive architectures used in video games are also analyzed. The bot codenamed CC-Bot2, winner of the 2K BotPrize 2010 competition and based on the CERA-CRANIUM cognitive architecture, is also described in this chapter. Specifically, the particular way in which CC-Bot2 processes the sensory-motor information and generates sequences of adaptive human-like actions is discussed. We also analyze the main differences between CC-Bot2 and other bots, focusing on the key features that allowed CC-Bot2 to win first place in the competition. Finally, we conclude by describing the main lines of work for future CC-Bot implementations and pointing out major conclusions about the application of Machine Consciousness to the design of believable bots. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

,A Multi-Agent Approach For Planning Activities In Decentralized Electricity Markets,"Despite the rigour and ability of game theory to cope with oligopolistic electric markets, it fails to model many existing behaviours in the real-world circumstances. The traditional models such as statistical extrapolation or econometrics are not capable to anticipate the changes in the pattern of the market prices due to the future structural changes. Furthermore, in such free and open markets, there is a more intense need for each participant to benefit from a certain level of autonomy, while keeping some capabilities to interact, communicate, collaborate and negotiate with other participants in an efficient way. As a result, there is a need for a novel framework of modelling that could include game theoretical assumptions as well as other more complex assumptions. Agent technologies in general and agent-based simulation in particular offer this possibility. This paper proposes, in a decision-making perspective, a new multi-agent architecture specifically designed to support planning activities in decentralized electricity markets, with a certain level of flexibility. In this model, synthetic agents are created allowing flexible representations of the multi-functional market players and possible mergers and coalitions in the electricity market. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

,A Multi-Measure Approach For Connecting Cognitive Workload And Automation,"Eye behavior metrics, time of run, and subjective survey results were assessed during human-computer interaction with high, low, and intermediate system autonomy levels. The results of this study are provided as a contribution to knowledge on the relationship between cognitive workload physiology and automation. Research suggests that changes in eye behavior metrics are related to changes in cognitive workload. Few studies have investigated the relationship between eye behavior metrics physiology measures and levels of automation. A within-subjects experiment involving 18 participants who played an open-source real-time strategy game was conducted. Three different versions of the game were developed, each with a unique static autonomy level designed from Sheridan and Verplank's 10 levels of autonomy (levels 2, 4, and 9). NASA-TLX subject survey ratings, time to complete run, and visual fixation rate were found to be significantly different among automation levels. These findings suggest that assessing visual physiology may be a promising indicator for evaluating cognitive workload when interacting with static autonomy levels. This efforts takes us one step closer to using visual physiology as a useful method for evaluating operator workload in almost real-time. Relevance to industry Potential applications of this research include development of software that integrates adaptive automation to improve human-computer task performance for high cognitive workload tasks (Air Traffic Control, aircraft piloting, process control, information analyst, etc.). © 2016",doi,10.1016/j.ijhcs.2016.05.008,Scopus,International Journal of Human Computer Studies,"Evans D.C., Fendley M.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,A Nonlinear Competitive Model Of The Prostate Tumor Growth Under Intermittent Androgen Suppression,"Hormone suppression has been the primary modality of treatment for prostate cancer. However long-term androgen deprivation may induce androgen-independent (AI) recurrence. Intermittent androgen suppression (IAS) is a potential way to delay or avoid the AI relapse. Mathematical models of tumor growth and treatment are simple while they are capable of capturing the essence of complicated interactions. Game theory models have analyzed that tumor cells can enhance their fitness by adopting genetically determined survival strategies. In this paper, we consider the survival strategies as the competitive advantage of tumor cells and propose a new model to mimic the prostate tumor growth in IAS therapy. Then we investigate the competition effect in tumor development by numerical simulations. The results indicate that successfully IAS-controlled states can be achieved even though the net growth rate of AI cells is positive for any androgen level. There is crucial difference between the previous models and the new one in the phase diagram of successful and unsuccessful tumor control by IAS administration, which means that the suggestions from the models for medication can be different. Furthermore we introduce quadratic logistic terms to the competition model to simulate the tumor growth in the environment with a finite carrying capacity considering the nutrients or inhibitors. The simulations show that the tumor growth can reach an equilibrium state or an oscillatory state with the net growth rate of AI cells being androgen independent. Our results suggest that the competition and the restraint of a limited environment can enhance the possibility of relapse prevention. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.jtbi.2016.05.033,Scopus,Journal of Theoretical Biology,"Yang J., Zhao T.-J., Yuan C.-Q., Xie J.-H., Hao F.-F.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,A Pricing Mechanism For Resource Allocation In Wireless Multimedia Applications,"We consider the problem of multiuser resource allocation for wireless multimedia applications deployed by autonomous and noncollaborative wireless stations (WSTAs). Existing resource allocation solutions for WLANs are not network-aware and do not take into account the selfish behavior of individual WSTAs. Specifically, the selfish WSTAs can manipulate the network by untruthfully representing their private information (i.e., video characteristics, experienced channel conditions, and deployed streaming strategies). This often results in inefficient resource allocations. To overcome this obstacle, we present a pricing mechanism for message exchanges between the WSTAs and the Central Spectrum Moderator (CSM). The messages represent network-aware resource demands and corresponding prices. We prove that the message exchanges reach the Nash equilibrium and that the resulting equilibrium messages generate allocations which are efficient, budget balanced, and satisfy voluntary participation. The simulation results verify that these properties hold when the WSTAs behave strategically. Additionally, we evaluate the impact of initial prices and network congestion level on the convergence rate of message exchanges. © 2007 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/JSTSP.2007.901519,Scopus,IEEE Journal on Selected Topics in Signal Processing,"Fu F., Stoenescu T.M., van der Schaar M.",2007,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,A Randomized Study Of Cognitive Remediation For Forensic And Mental Health Patients With Schizophrenia,"Cognitive remediation has proven efficacy for improving neurocognition in people with schizophrenia. The current study evaluated the benefits of cognitive remediation on neurocognition, functioning, psychotic symptoms, and aggression in a sample of forensic and mental health patients. Care recipients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (N=78) receiving services in the forensic and mental health units of a state hospital were randomized to participate in cognitive remediation versus computer games control activities. Participants' neurocognition, functional capacity, experiential recovery, psychotic symptoms, and aggression incidents were assessed at baseline and posttreatment. Cognitive remediation was associated with improvements in several neurocognitive domains and circumscribed domains of functional capacity. People assigned to cognitive remediation experiences greater reductions in negative symptoms, agitation/excitement, and verbal and physical aggression.

,A Real Time Biofeedback Using Kinect And Wii To Improve Gait For Post-Total Knee Replacement Rehabilitation: A Case Study Report,"Purpose: This study aimed to develop a low-cost real-time biofeedback system to assist with rehabilitation for patients following total knee replacement (TKR) and to assess its feasibility of use in a post-TKR patient case study design with a comparison group. Method: The biofeedback system consisted of Microsoft KinectTM and Nintendo Wii balance board with a dedicated software. A six-week inpatient rehabilitation program was augmented by biofeedback and tested in a single patient following TKR. Three patients underwent a six weeks standard rehabilitation with no biofeedback and served as a control group. Gait, function and pain were assessed and compared before and after the rehabilitation. Results: The biofeedback software incorporated real time visual feedback to correct limb alignment, movement pattern and weight distribution. Improvements in pain, function and quality of life were observed in both groups. The strong improvement in the knee moment pattern demonstrated in the case study indicates feasibility of the biofeedback-augmented intervention. Conclusion: This novel biofeedback software has used simple commercially accessible equipment that can be feasibly incorporated to augment a post-TKR rehabilitation program. Our preliminary results indicate the potential of this biofeedback-assisted rehabilitation to improve knee function during gait. Research is required to test this hypothesis.Implications for RehabilitationThe real-time biofeedback system developed integrated custom-made software and simple low-cost commercially accessible equipment such as Kinect and Wii board to provide augmented information during rehabilitation following TKR.The software incorporated key rehabilitation principles and visual feedback to correct alignment of the lower legs, pelvic and trunk as well as providing feedback on limbs weight distribution.The case study patient demonstrated greater improvement in their knee function where a more normal biphasic knee moment was achieved following the six-week biofeedback intervention. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",doi,10.3109/17483107.2015.1080767,Scopus,Disability and Rehabilitation: Assistive Technology,"Levinger P., Zeina D., Teshome A.K., Skinner E., Begg R., Abbott J.H.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,A Serious Game With A Thermal Haptic Mouse,"Human senses are responsible for providing feedback from the surrounding environment that enable the execution of any day life activity. But, has time passes by, the sensing ability tends to decline together with the capability to process information and control the members as well as the entire body.The present work reports an ongoing work on the development of a new haptic device, designed to be used mainly by elder person, stimulating and quantifying the nervous system response capability. This was achieved through a serious game, using a temperature controlled element. The user positions his/her hand/finger on the device in order to capture the temperature stimulus. Depending on the sensation perceived (hot or cold), a basic task is required to be execute.The time to execute the task can be used to get information on the user's global nervous system current condition.",doi,10.3991/ijoe.v9iS8.3399,Scopus,International Journal of Online Engineering,"Silva A., Restivo M.T., Gabriel J.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,A Statistically Rigorous Analysis Of 2D Path-Planning Algorithms,"Path-planning is a well-known studied problem in Artificial Intelligence. Given two points in a map, path-planning algorithms search for a path that joins those two points, avoiding obstacles. It is a challenging problem with important practical applications in a wide range of applications: autonomous mobile robotics, logistics or video games, just to mention some of them. Given its importance, it has attracted much research, resulting in a large number of algorithms, some classical, such as A∗, other more specialized, such as swarms. However, despite all the literature dedicated to this problem, the statistics used to analyze experimental results in most cases are naïve. In this paper, we position in favor of the need of incorporating stronger statistical methods in path-planning empirical research and promote a debate in the research community. To this end, we analyze some 2D-grid classical path-planning algorithms in discrete domains (i.e. A∗ and A∗ with post-processing) and more recent algorithms in continuous domains (i.e. Theta∗ and S-Theta∗). Given the differences of these algorithms, we study them under different criteria: Run-time, number of heading changes, number of expanded vertices and path-length. © The British Computer Society 2014.

,A Twin Study Of Cardiac Reactivity And Its Relationship To Parental Blood Pressure,"The cardiac reactivity of 40 monozygotic and 40 dizygotic pairs of young male twins was monitored during psychological challenge, as afforded by a video game. The observed pattern of variation could not be accounted for solely by environmental factors. In fact, a simple genetic model that implicated additive genetic effects, along with those stemming from individual environments, best fitted the data. In addition, cardiac reactions were substantially greater for subjects whose parents both had relatively elevated blood pressure. Overall, these data suggest individual differences in cardiac reactivity have a heritable component, and that high reactivity may be a precursor of elevated blood pressure. © 1985.",doi,10.1016/0031-9384(85)90085-X,Scopus,Physiology and Behavior,"Carroll D., Hewitt J.K., Last K.A., Turner J.R., Sims J.",1985,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,A Unifying Framework For Iterative Approximate Best-Response Algorithms For Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems,"Distributed constraint optimization problems (DCOPs) are important in many areas of computer science and optimization. In a DCOP, each variable is controlled by one of many autonomous agents, who together have the joint goal of maximizing a global objective function. A wide variety of techniques have been explored to solve such problems, and here we focus on one of the main families, namely iterative approximate best-response algorithms used as local search algorithms for DCOPs. We define these algorithms as those in which, at each iteration, agents communicate only the states of the variables under their control to their neighbours on the constraint graph, and that reason about their next state based on the messages received from their neighbours. These algorithms include the distributed stochastic algorithm and stochastic coordination algorithms, the maximum-gain messaging algorithms, the families of fictitious play and adaptive play algorithms, and algorithms that use regret-based heuristics. This family of algorithms is commonly employed in real-world systems, as they can be used in domains where communication is difficult or costly, where it is appropriate to trade timeliness off against optimality, or where hardware limitations render complete or more computationally intensive algorithms unusable. However, until now, no overarching framework has existed for analyzing this broad family of algorithms, resulting in similar and overlapping work being published independently in several different literatures. The main contribution of this paper, then, is the development of a unified analytical framework for studying such algorithms. This framework is built on our insight that when formulated as non-cooperative games, DCOPs form a subset of the class of potential games. This result allows us to prove convergence properties of iterative approximate best-response algorithms developed in the computer science literature using game-theoretic methods (which also shows that such algorithms can also be applied to the more general problem of finding Nash equilibria in potential games), and, conversely, also allows us to show that many game-theoretic algorithms can be used to solve DCOPs. By so doing, our framework can assist system designers by making the pros and cons of, and the synergies between, the various iterative approximate best-response DCOP algorithm components clear. © Cambridge University Press 2011.",doi,10.1017/S0269888911000178,Scopus,Knowledge Engineering Review,"Chapman A.C., Rogers A., Jennings N.R., Leslie D.S.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Abnormal Activity In Reward Brain Circuits In Human Narcolepsy With Cataplexy,"Objective: Hypothalamic hypocretins (or orexins) regulate energy metabolism and arousal maintenance. Recent animal research suggests that hypocretins may also influence reward-related behaviors. In humans, the loss of hypocretin-containing neurons results in a major sleep-wake disorder called narcolepsy-cataplexy, which is associated with emotional disturbances. Here, we aim to test whether narcoleptic patients show an abnormal pattern of brain activity during reward processing. Methods: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging in 12 unmedicated patients with narcolepsy-cataplexy to measure the neural responses to expectancy and experience of monetary gains and losses. We statistically compared the patients' data with those obtained in a group of 12 healthy matched controls. Results and Interpretation: Our results reveal that activity in the dopaminergic ventral midbrain (ventral tegmental area) was not modulated in narcolepsy-cataplexy patients during high reward expectancy (unlike controls), and that ventral striatum activity was reduced during winning. By contrast, the patients showed abnormal activity increases in the amygdala and in dorsal striatum for positive outcomes. In addition, we found that activity in the nucleus accumbens and the ventral-medial prefrontal cortex correlated with disease duration, suggesting that an alternate neural circuit could be privileged over the years to control affective responses to emotional challenges and compensate for the lack of influence from ventral midbrain regions. Our study offers a detailed picture of the distributed brain network involved during distinct stages of reward processing and shows for the first time, to our knowledge, how this network is affected in hypocretin-deficient narcoleptic patients. © 2010 American Neurological Association.",doi,10.1002/ana.21825,Scopus,Annals of Neurology,"Ponz A., Khatami R., Poryazova R., Werth E., Boesiger P., Bassetti C.L., Schwartz S.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,"Active Video Games And Physical Activity Recommendations: A Comparison Of The Gamercize Stepper, Xbox Kinect And Xavix J-Mat","Objectives: The current study was designed to evaluate the intensity levels of three exergames and determine the association with physical activity recommendations that correspond to specific outcomes. The variation in cardiovascular responses between the three exergames was also examined. Design: We employed a cross-sectional laboratory design. Methods: We recruited 18 girls to participate in a peak VO2 test and to play Gamercize, Kinect River Rush, XaviX J-Mat at three separate exergaming sessions. Linear regression equations of heart rate and percentage of peak VO2 were calculated for each participant to determine the intensity of exergame play. Differences in intensity between the three exergames and time spent in the recommended moderate (heart rate at ≥55% peak VO2) and vigorous (heart rate at ≥75% peak VO2) intensity levels were analyzed. We calculated the coefficient of variation for the mean heart rate to determine the difference in variance in heart rate values for the three exergames. Results: When playing Gamercize and Kinect the girls did not play at recommended moderate or vigorous levels. Although the girls did not play at vigorous levels when playing XaviX J-Mat, our results showed that when playing XaviX J-Mat they did play at moderate intensity levels. No significant differences in the coefficient of variation between the three exergames were apparent. Conclusions: If active gaming is to be used to increase physical activity levels then individual differences in levels of exertion and specific activity recommendations need to be taken into consideration. © 2013 Sports Medicine Australia.",doi,10.1016/j.jsams.2013.05.008,Scopus,Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport,"Mellecker R.R., McManus A.M.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Activity Profile Of Top-Class Association Football Referees In Relation To Fitness-Test Performance And Match Standard,"The aim of this study was to examine the kinematic activity profiles, cardiovascular responses and physical fitness of top-class football referees (n = 11) during the FIFA Confederations Cup 2005. Computerised match-analyses (n = 9) were performed with a two-dimensional photogrammetric video system, and the cardiovascular demand imposed on the referees (n = 12) was measured using heart rate recordings. Total distance covered was 10,218, s = 643 m of which 3531, s = 510 m was covered at high intensities (&gt; 3.6 m · s-1). Both total distance covered (r2 = 0.59; P = 0.02) and high-intensity activities (r2 = 0.44; P = 0.05) were related to the distance covered by the ball in the same match. The referees ran at high speed 37% further (P = 0.01) in the actual tournament than during under-17 top-level officiating. After the 5-min interval during which high-speed running peaked, in the following 5 min the performance was reduced by 19% (P = 0.01) in relation to the mean of the game. Mean heart rate was 161, s = 9 b · min-1 (86, s = 3% of maximal heart rate (HRmax)). Mean heart rate (expressed as percentage of HRmax) was related in part (r2 = 0.36; P &lt; 0.01) to the number of high-intensity activities performed in the same 5-min interval. The results of this study show that: (1) kinematic activity profiles of top-class referees can be influenced by the distance covered by the ball; (2) the amount of high-speed running (&gt;5 m · s-1) best describes the physical performance of referees; (3) heart rate recording can be a useful tool to determine the most intense periods of a match and (4) the new fitness tests adopted by FIFA were poor predictors of match activities.",doi,10.1080/02640410802298227,Scopus,Journal of Sports Sciences,"Mallo J., Navarro E., Aranda J.M.G., Helsen W.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Adult Attachment Style Modulates Neural Responses In A Mentalizing Task,"Adult attachment style (AAS) is a personality trait that affects social cognition. Behavioral data suggest that AAS influences mentalizing proficiency, i.e. the ability to predict and explain people's behavior with reference to mental states, but the neural correlates are unknown. We here tested how the AAS dimensions ""avoidance"" (AV) and ""anxiety"" (ANX) modulate neural correlates of mentalizing.We measured brain activation using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 164 healthy subjects during an interactive mentalizing paradigm (Prisoner's Dilemma Game). AAS was assessed with the Relationship Scales Questionnaire, including the subscales AV and ANX.Our task elicited a strong activation of the mentalizing network, including bilateral precuneus, (anterior, middle, and posterior) cingulate cortices, temporal poles, inferior frontal gyri (IFG), temporoparietal junctions, superior medial frontal gyri as well as right medial orbital frontal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus (MFG), and amygdala. We found that AV is positively and ANX negatively correlated with task-associated neural activity in the right amygdala, MFG, midcingulate cortex, and superior parietal lobule, and in bilateral IFG. These data suggest that avoidantly attached adults activate brain areas implicated in emotion regulation and cognitive control to a larger extent than anxiously attached individuals during mentalizing. © 2015 IBRO.

,Affective Biasing Of Choices In Gambling Task Decision Making,"The proponents of the somatic marker hypothesis presume that rational decision making is guided by emotional reactions that are developed from prior experience. Supporting evidence for the hypothesis comes almost exclusively from the short-term affective reactions that are learned during the course of a hypothetical decision-making task-the gambling task (GT). We examined GT performance and affective reactions to choices when those choices were biased by words that had preexisting affective value. In one experiment, affectively valued words directly signaled good and bad choices. A congruent relation between affective value of word and choice outcome improved GT performance, whereas an incongruent relation greatly interfered with performance. In another experiment, affectively valued words were maintained as a working memory (WM) load between GT choices. A WM load with affectively positive words somewhat improved GT performance, whereas affectively negative words interfered with performance. Somatic markers-indicated by differential anticipatory skin conductance response (SCR) amplitude for good and bad choices-appeared at a point in the GT session when choice performance was superior. However, differential SCR developed during the session after good choice performance was already established. These results indicate that preexisting affective biases can influence GT decision making. In addition, the somatic markers that are regular accompaniments of GT decision making appeared to be temporally lagging indicators of choice performance.

,Affective Educational Games And The Evolving Teaching Experience,"Teaching methods must adapt to learners' expectations. Computer game-based learning environments enable learning through experimentation and are inherently motivational. However, for identifying when learners achieve learning goals and providing suitable feedback, Intelligent Tutoring Systems must be used. Recognizing the learner's affective state enables educational games to improve the learner's experience or to distinguish relevant emotions. This chapter discusses the creation of an affective student model that infers the learner's emotions from cognitive and motivational variables through observable behavior. The control-value theory of 'achievement emotions' provides a basis for this work. A Probabilistic Relational Models (PRMs) approach for affective student modeling, which is based on Dynamic Bayesian Networks, is discussed. The approach is tested through a prototyping study based on Wizard-of-Oz experiments and preliminary results are presented. The affective student model will be incorporated into PlayPhysics, an emotional game-based learning environment for teaching Physics. PRMs facilitate the design of student models with Bayesian Networks. The effectiveness of PlayPhysics will be evaluated by comparing the students' learning gains and learning efficiencies. © 2011, IGI Global.",doi,10.4018/978-1-60960-569-8.ch013,Scopus,Computer Games as Educational and Management Tools: Uses and Approaches,"Muñoz K., Mc Kevitt P., Lunney T., Noguez J., Neri L.",2011,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Affective Games: How Iopiates Elicit An Emotional Fix,"Video-games, like movies, music and storybooks are emotional artifacts. We buy media to alter our affective state. Through consumption they impact our physiology and thus alter our affective world. In this chapter the authors review the ways in which playing games can elicit emotion. This chapter will discuss the increased power of video-game technology to elicit affect, and show how the mash-up of traditional and interactive techniques have delivered a richness of emotion that competes with film and television. They then conclude by looking forward to a time when video-games become the dominant medium, and the preferred choice when seeking that emotional fix. © 2011, IGI Global.",doi,10.4018/978-1-61692-892-6.ch016,Scopus,"Affective Computing and Interaction: Psychological, Cognitive and Neuroscientific Perspectives",Sykes J.,2010,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Affective Speech Elicited With A Computer Game,"To determine the degree to which emotional changes in speech reflect factors other than arousal, such as valence, the authors used a computer game to induce natural emotional speech. Voice samples were elicited following game events that were either conducive or obstructive to the goal of winning and were accompanied by either pleasant or unpleasant sounds. Acoustic analysis of the speech recordings of 30 adolescents revealed that mean energy, fundamental-frequency level, utterance duration, and the proportion of an utterance that was voiced varied with goal conduciveness; spectral energy distribution depended on manipulations of pleasantness; and pitch dynamics depended on the interaction of pleasantness and goal conduciveness. The results suggest that a single arousal dimension does not adequately characterize a number of emotion-related vocal changes, lending weight to multidimensional theories of emotional response patterning.

,Alternating Task Modules In Isochronal Distributed Training Of Complex Tasks,"We compared an alternating task modules (ATM) protocol-which alternated sessions on Space Fortress, Phoenix (video-game like tasks), and algebra word problems-with a massed protocol, which blocked sessions on the tasks. The protocols were isochronal (equal in duration), each entailing one week of training and testing. ATM gave the men and women an advantage in learning and retention on Space Fortress and algebra word problems; it did not change their performance on Phoenix. Arousal, not confidence or motivation, was implicated in the ATM advantage. The practical implication of demonstrating and describing ATM benefits is that real-world training often requires minimal durations. This pragmatic constraint favors ATM over frequently investigated anisochronal schedules, in which spacing practice over long durations is more effective than massing practice in short durations. Evaluations of retention, arousal, motivation, and confidence began the process of testing theories that might be expanded to explain and enhance ATM benefits.We compared an alternating task modules (ATM) protocol - which alternated sessions on Space Fortress, Phoenix (video-game-like tasks), and algebra word problems - with a massed protocol, which blocked sessions on the tasks.

,An Exploratory Study Examining The Appropriateness And Potential Benefit Of The Nintendo Wii As A Physical Activity Tool In Adults Aged ≥ 55 Years,"This study investigates the physical exertion of playing the Nintendo Wii® (Wii) and determines the appropriateness and potential benefit of it as a physical activity tool for older adults. Twenty healthy adults (aged 61±6 years) took part in a single session using a selection of the Wii Sports and Wii Fit games. During the gameplay session, heart rate and perceived exertion were measured. Pre-and post-session, we investigated mood using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) and cognitive function (i.e. aptitude, abstract reasoning and problem solving) using the test of non-verbal intelligence (TONI-IQ) and trail B tests. We also gathered subjective feedback from participants using semi-structured interviews and questionnaires. Three of the game activities (hula-hoop, rowing squat and leg extension) were identified to reach a moderate level of heart rate intensity, with one activity (jogging) corresponding to a vigorous level. We identified that post-session PANAS-positive subscale scores were greater than pre-session scores (P&lt;0.01). There was a reduction in the time to complete the TONI-IQ test from pre-to post-session (P&lt;0.05). Findings from these data identify that some Wii activities were of an intensity required for health benefits; a single Wii activity session can result in positive mood changes and the Wii interface is generally acceptable and appropriate for this older age adult group. Further randomized controlled and longer term intervention trials are needed to determine the effectiveness of exergame activity programmes. © 2013 The Author.",doi,10.1093/iwc/iws004,Scopus,Interacting with Computers,"Kirk A., MacMillan F., Rice M., Carmichael A.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali

,Analysis Of The Characteristics Of Competitive Badminton,"Objective: To describe the characteristics of badminton in order to determine the energy requirements, temporal structure, and movements in the game that indicate performance level. To use the findings to plan training with greater precision. Methods: Eleven badminton players (mean (SD) age 21.8 (3.26) years) with international experience from four different countries (France, Italy, Spain, and Portugal) were studied. Two of the Spanish players were monitored in several matches, giving a total of 14 samples, all during the 1999 Spanish International Tournament. Blood lactate concentration was measured with a reflective photometer. Maximum and average heart rates were recorded with a heart rate monitor. Temporal structure and actions during the matches were determined from video recordings. All variables were measured during and after the game and later analysed using a descriptive study. Results: The results confirmed the high demands of the sport, with a maximum heart rate of 190.5 beats/min and an average of 173.5 beats/min during matches over 28 minutes long and performance intervals of 6.4 seconds and rest time of 12.9 seconds between exchanges. Conclusions: The results suggest that badminton is characterised by repetitive efforts of alactic nature and great intensity which are cantinuously performed throughout the match. An awareness of these characteristics, together with data on the correlations between certain actions such as unforced errors and winning shots and the final result of the match, will aid in more appropriate planning and monitoring of specific training.",doi,10.1136/bjsm.37.1.62,Scopus,British Journal of Sports Medicine,"Cabello Manrique D., González-Badillo J.J.",2003,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Applications Of A Theory Of Automated Adversarial Planning To Command And Control,"One of the potentially most valuable research areas within artificial intelligence (Al), from the standpoint of military applications, involves the development of automatic planning systems. AI planners not only have the potential of autonomously solving various low-level planning problems such as those found in robotics applications, but can form the basis of expert consultation systems for higher level military planning problems including those involving command and control. An overview of a theory of automated adversarial planning is presented, which has been derived from the enhancement and expansion of AI techniques from the areas of automated planning and knowledge-based computer game playing. The adversarial planning paradigm has been successfully implemented in ARES (adversarial reasoning system), a computer program which can plan sequences of robot actions and compete in game environments, where various kinds of adversity (including intelligent adversarial counter-planners) exist.

,Are The Effects Of Unreal Violent Video Games Pronounced When Playing With A Virtual Reality System?,"This study was conducted to analyze the short-term effects of violent electronic games, played with or without a virtual reality (VR) device, on the instigation of aggressive behavior. Physiological arousal (heart rate (HR)), priming of aggressive thoughts, and state hostility were also measured to test their possible mediation on the relationship between playing the violent game (VG) and aggression. The participants - 148 undergraduate students - were randomly assigned to four treatment conditions: two groups played a violent computer game (Unreal Tournament), and the other two a non-violent game (Motocross Madness), half with a VR device and the remaining participants on the computer screen. In order to assess the game effects the following instruments were used: a BIOPAC System MP100 to measure HR, an Emotional Stroop task to analyze the priming of aggressive and fear thoughts, a self-report State Hostility Scale to measure hostility, and a competitive reaction-time task to assess aggressive behavior. The main results indicated that the violent computer game had effects on state hostility and aggression. Although no significant mediation effect could be detected, regression analyses showed an indirect effect of state hostility between playing a VG and aggression. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",doi,10.1002/ab.20272,Scopus,Aggressive Behavior,"Arriaga P., Esteves F., Carneiro P., Monteiro M.B.",2008,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,"Are There Optimal Levels Of Arousal To Memory? Effects Of Arousal, Centrality, And Familiarity On Brand Memory In Video Games","Using a modified first-person shooter game, Counter Strike 2, this study tested (1) if the Yerkes-Dodson law could be applied to the relationship between physiological arousal (skin conductance) and brand memory in the new interactive technology setting; (2) if central and familiar ads are better recognized; and (3) if there are any interaction effects among arousal, centrality, and familiarity on brand memory. A pre-test was conducted to estimate the cut-off points of arousal into three levels (low, medium, and high) in the identical setting. Through within-subject analysis, a total of 550 cases were categorized into the three levels of arousal and analyzed. The results showed the highest recognition scores at the medium level of arousal, and no significant difference between the medium and high levels of arousal in brand memory. The participants remembered better centrally located brands than peripheral brands. Familiarity also had a positive relationship with the levels of arousal. Particularly, the recognition scores for centrally located brands increased with the levels of arousal, but no difference was found for peripheral brands. Findings and implications were discussed. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

,Argumentation-Based Negotiation,"Negotiation is essential in settings where autonomous agents have conflicting interests and a desire to cooperate. For this reason, mechanisms in which agents exchange potential agreements according to various rules of interaction have become very popular in recent years as evident, for example, in the auction and mechanism design community. However, a growing body of research is now emerging which points out limitations in such mechanisms and advocates the idea that agents can increase the likelihood and quality of an agreement by exchanging arguments which influence each others' states. This community further argues that argument exchange is sometimes essential when various assumptions about agent rationality cannot be satisfied. To this end, in this article, we identify the main research motivations and ambitions behind work in the field. We then provide a conceptual framework through which we outline the core elements and features required by agents engaged in argumentation-based negotiation, as well as the environment that hosts these agents. For each of these elements, we survey and evaluate existing proposed techniques in the literature and highlight the major challenges that need to be addressed if argument-based negotiation research is to reach its full potential.",doi,10.1017/S0269888904000098,Scopus,Knowledge Engineering Review,"Rahwan I., Ramchurn S.D., Jennings N.R., McBurney P., Parsons S., Sonenberg L.",2003,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Artificial Time Constraints On The Iowa Gambling Task: The Effects On Behavioural Performance And Subjective Experience,"In the last decade, the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) has become a widely employed neuropsychological research instrument for the investigation of executive function. The task has been employed in a wide range of formats, from 'manual' procedures to more recently introduced computerised versions. Computer-based formats often require that responses on the task should be artificially delayed by a number of seconds between trials to collect skin-conductance data. Participants, however, may become frustrated when they want to select from a particular deck in the time-limited versions-so that an unintended emotional experience of frustration might well disrupt a task presumed to be reliant on emotion-based learning. We investigated the effect of the various types of Iowa Gambling Task format on performance, using three types of task: the classic manual administration, with no time limitations; a computerised administration with a 6-s enforced delay; and a control computerised version which had no time constraints. We also evaluated the subjective experience of participants on each task. There were no significant differences in performance, between formats, in behavioural terms. Subjective experience measures on the task also showed consistent effects across all three formats-with substantial, and rapidly developing, awareness of which decks were 'good' and 'bad.' © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

,Association Between Feeling Upon Awakening And Use Of Information Technology Devices In Japanese Children,"Background: The objective of this study was to clarify the relationship between feeling upon awakening (FA) and time spent using information technology (IT) devices by children in kindergartens, elementary schools, and junior high schools in Shimane, Japan. Methods: In October 2008, a self-report survey was distributed to 2075 children in kindergartens (n = 261), elementary schools (n = 1162), and junior high schools (n = 652) in Shimane, Japan. The questionnaire gathered data on sex, school year, feeling upon awakening, and time spent using IT devices after school (television, videos on television, video games, personal computers, and cellular phones). After adjusting for sex and school year, data were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression analysis to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: A total of 2030 children completed this survey (response rate, 97.8%). Negative FA was associated with watching television more than 2 hours/day (OR = 1.51, 95% CI = 1.23-1.85), playing video games more than 30 minutes/day (1.50, 1.20-1.87), and using personal computers more than 30 minutes/day (1.35, 1.04-1.75). Conclusions: Time spent using IT devices affected the FA of children in kindergarten through junior high school. We propose the development of guidelines regarding the appropriate amount of time this population should spend using IT devices. © 2011 by the Japan Epidemiological Association.",doi,10.2188/jea.JE20110019,Scopus,Journal of Epidemiology,"Kondo Y., Tanabe T., Kobayashi-Miura M., Amano H., Yamaguchi N., Kamura M., Fujita Y.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Axiomatic Scalable Neurocontroller Analysis Via The Shapley Value,"One of the major challenges in the field of neurally driven evolved autonomous agents is deciphering the neural mechanisms underlying their behavior. Aiming at this goal, we have developed the multi-perturbation Shapley value analysis (MSA) - the first axiomatic and rigorous method for deducing causal function localization from multiple-perturbation data, substantially improving on earlier approaches. Based on fundamental concepts from game theory, the MSA provides a formal way of defining and quantifying the contributions of network elements, as well as the functional interactions between them. The previously presented versions of the MSA require full knowledge (or at least an approximation) of the network's performance under all possible multiple perturbations, limiting their applicability to systems with a small number of elements. This article focuses on presenting new scalable MSA variants, allowing for the analysis of large complex networks in an efficient manner, including large-scale neurocontrollers. The successful operation of the MSA along with the new variants is demonstrated in the analysis of several neurocontrollers solving a food foraging task, consisting of up to 100 neural elements. ©2006 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",doi,10.1162/artl.2006.12.3.333,Scopus,Artificial Life,"Keinan A., Sandbank B., Hilgetag C.C., Meilijson I., Ruppin E.",2006,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Balancing For Gross Motor Ability In Exergaming Between Youth With Cerebral Palsy At Gross Motor Function Classification System Levels Ii And Iii,"Objective: To test how three custom-built balancing algorithms minimize differences in game success, time above 40% heart rate reserve (HRR), and enjoyment between youth with cerebral palsy (CP) who have different gross motor function capabilities. Youth at Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) level II (unassisted walking) and level III (mobility aids needed for walking) competed in a cycling-based exercise video game that tested three balancing algorithms. Materials and Methods: Three algorithms: A control (generic-balancing [GB]), a constant non-person specific (One-Speed-For-All [OSFA]), and a person-specific (Target-Cadence [TC]) algorithms were built. In this prospective repeated measures intervention trial with randomized and blinded algorithm assignment, 10 youth with CP aged 10-16 years (X ± standard deviation = 12.4 ± 1.8 years; GMFCS level II n = 4, III n = 6) played six exergaming sessions using each of the three algorithms. Outcomes included game success as measured by a normalized game score, time above 40% HRR, and enjoyment. Results: The TC algorithm balanced game success between GMFCS levels similarly to GB (P = 0.11) and OSFA (P = 0.41). TC showed poorer balancing in time above 40% HRR compared to GB (P = 0.02) and OSFA (P = 0.02). Enjoyment ratings were high (6.4 ± 0.7/7) and consistent between all algorithms (TC vs. GB: P = 0.80 and TC vs. OSFA: P = 0.19). Conclusion: TC shows promise in balancing game success and enjoyment but improvements are needed to balance between GMFCS levels for cardiovascular exercise. © 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",doi,10.1089/g4h.2016.0073,Scopus,Games for Health Journal,"MacIntosh A., Switzer L., Hernandez H., Hwang S., Schneider A.L.J., Moran D., Graham T.C.N., Fehlings D.L.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Bio-Affective Computer Interface For Game Interaction,"Affective bio-feedback can be an important instrument to enhance the game experience. Several studies have provided evidence of the usefulness of physiological signals for affective gaming; however, due to the limited knowledge about the distinctive autonomic signatures for every emotion, the pattern matching models employed are limited in the number of emotions they are able to classify. This paper presents a bio-affective gaming interface (BAGI) that can be used to customize a game experience according to the player's emotional response. Its architecture offers important characteristics for gaming that are important because they make possible the reusability of previous findings and the inclusion of new models to the system. In order to prove the effectiveness of BAGI, two different types of neural networks have been trained to recognize emotions. They were incorporated into the system to customize, in real-time, the computer wallpaper according to the emotion experienced by the user. Best results were obtained with a probabilistic neural network with accuracy results of 84.46% on the training data and 78.38% on the validation for new independent data sets.

,Blood Pressure And Response To “Stress” In 11–16 Year Old Children,"ABSTRACT. Blood pressure at rest and cardiovascular response to “stress” were studied in 27 girls and 33 boys 11–16 years old. One group (HT, n = 23) had hypertensive mothers with a previous hypertensive pregnancy, another group (NT, n = 20) had normotensive mothers with a previous hypertensive pregnancy and the control group (C, n = 17) had normotensive mothers with normotensive pregnancies. Resting blood pressure was 124/71 mmHg (HT), 117/67 mmHg (NT) and 112/65 mmHg in the 3 groups. Systolic pressure was significantly different in all 3 groups (p < 0.05 ‐ p <0.001). Responses to noise stimulation (100 dBA) were identical in all groups with increases in diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure and cardiac output. During a video game session increases in blood pressure and heart rate were equal in the groups but during physical exercise a slight decrease in diastolic blood pressure was seen in the NT and C groups only. Differences in blood pressure in children with varying maternal history of hypertension do not seem to reflect alterations in the cardiovascular response pattern to “stress”. 1985 Association for the Publication of the Journal of Internal Medicine",doi,10.1111/j.0954-6820.1985.tb08776.x,Scopus,Acta Medica Scandinavica,"Svensson A., Hansson L.",1985,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,"Body Mass Index Of 16-Year Olds In Urban Maseru, Lesotho","Background: Overweight and/or obesity amongst children and adolescents is a global epidemic with health consequences that track into adulthood. No data are currently available regarding overweight/obesity amongst adolescents in Lesotho. Aim and setting: To assess the prevalence of overweight and/or obesity and the associated risk factors amongst 16-year olds in urban Maseru, Lesotho. Method: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted on a systematic sample of 16-year olds in grade four (N = 221; 56.6% girls) from randomly-selected schools in urban Maseru. Diet histories and data on lifestyle, physical activity and knowledge, attitudes and/or perceptions and practices regarding nutrition were obtained during structured interviews and body mass index (BMI) was determined. Results: Amongst these 16-year olds, 27.2% girls and 8.3% boys were overweight and/or obese based on World Health Organization cut-offs for BMI; 39.8% were insufficiently active or inactive; 6.4% used alcohol regularly; and 11.7% used tobacco. Whilst 28.1% reported no television watching/ electronic gaming/computer usage (combined screen time) outside school, 23.6% reported ≥ 4 hours of combined screen time outside school. Most (91.4%) consumed < 3 servings of vegetables/ day; 86.4% consumed < 2 servings of fruits/day; and 95.5% consumed < 2 servings of dairy/day. The majority consumed maize porridge (56.1%), bread (63.8%) and margarine/oil/fat (82.3%) daily and added sugar to their food (74.2%). Fruits, vegetables, dairy, meat, pulses and traditional foods were only consumed weekly or less often. Most bought from tuck shops (18.6% daily; 54.3% weekly). Various gaps in knowledge, perceptions and practices were identified that may benefit from educational intervention. Conclusions: The current study identifies westernised dietary and lifestyle changes, along with overweight and/or obesity, amongst 16-year old adolescents in Lesotho. © 2014.

,Brain Activity During The Flow Experience: A Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy Study,"Flow is the holistic experience felt when an individual acts with total involvement. Although flow is likely associated with many functions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), such as attention, emotion, and reward processing, no study has directly investigated the activity of the PFC during flow. The objective of this study was to examine activity in the PFC during the flow state using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Twenty right-handed university students performed a video game task under conditions designed to induce psychological states of flow and boredom. During each task and when completing the flow state scale for occupational tasks, change in oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy-Hb) concentration in frontal brain regions was measured using fNIRS. During the flow condition, oxy-Hb concentration was significantly increased in the right and left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. Oxy-Hb concentration tended to decrease in the boredom condition. There was a significant increase in oxy-Hb concentration in the right and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, right and left frontal pole areas, and left ventrolateral PFC when participants were completing the flow state scale after performing the task in the flow condition. In conclusion, flow is associated with activity of the PFC, and may therefore be associated with functions such as cognition, emotion, maintenance of internal goals, and reward processing. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.neulet.2014.05.011,Scopus,Neuroscience Letters,"Yoshida K., Sawamura D., Inagaki Y., Ogawa K., Ikoma K., Sakai S.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Building Up Serious Games With An Artificial Life Approach: Two Case Studies,"Artificial Life (AL) studies how to reproduce life-like phenomena exploring the life as could be in artificial systems (software, hardware, or hybrid). This challenging scientific perspective has produced a number of programming techniques often applied to solve concrete problems (Data Analysis, Process Optimization, Social Simulations, etc.). Computer Gaming is a field where AL techniques are applied. There are many successfully Alife products for pure entertainment (e.g., Tamagotchi and Creatures) and for educational objectives (e.g., Avida-Ed). However, we notice that all AL-Based games share a general flavor: they refer in someway to biological scenarios. In other terms, they represent often a sort of popularization of AL experiments designed for non-scientists. In this paper we argue that AL programming techniques (or more basically bio-inspired computational algorithms) could be used to develop generic games (e.g., sports, adventures, business games, etc.) without any relation with a biological perspective. We describe BreedBot and Learn2Lead, two Serious Games that we think could be paradigmatic examples about how to use AL techniques in different ways and fields that could be very different from their biological roots. BreedBot and its sequels (BestBot and BrianFarm) have been developed to disseminate the core-concepts of Autonomous Robotics and Learn2Lead has been developed to teach Psychological Theories of Teamwork in Small and Medium Enterprises. In BreedBot, AL techniques are used to develop the player–game interaction and they are explicitly visible by the user (he/she has to train/evolve a population of artificial agents). At the opposite side, Lear2lead has an old style appearance but it hides an AL engine. In this case AL techniques are used to model the game mechanics (e.g., artificial team dynamics and avatars’ behavior). Both games are also able to be played online (www.​nac.​unina.​it/​bestbot2 and www.​unina.​l2l.​it). © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.",doi,10.1007/978-3-642-37577-4_10,Scopus,"Evolution, Complexity and Artificial Life","Gigliotta O., Miglino O., Schembri M., Di Ferdinando A.",2014,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Can Brain Games Help Smokers Quit?: Results Of A Randomized Clinical Trial,"Background and aims Deficits in cognitive function are observed during nicotine withdrawal and present a challenge to successful smoking cessation. This clinical trial evaluated a cognitive exercise training (CT) program to improve smoking cessation rates. Methods Adult treatment-seeking smokers (n = 213) were randomized to receive nicotine patch therapy and 12 weeks of either computerized CT or computerized relaxation (control) training. Smoking status was biochemically verified at the end of treatment and 6-month follow-up. Results Quit rates did not differ by treatment arm at either time-point, nor were there effects on withdrawal symptoms or smoking urges. Reaction time for emotion recognition and verbal interference tasks showed improvement in the CT group. When including only successful quitters, improvements in recognition memory, verbal interference accuracy, and attention switching error rate were also observed in the CT group, while commission errors on the continuous performance task decreased in the control group. Conclusions Despite modest changes in cognitive performance, these results do not support the efficacy of computerized cognitive training as an adjunctive therapy for smoking cessation. © 2016",doi,10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2016.08.621,Scopus,Drug and Alcohol Dependence,"Loughead J., Falcone M., Wileyto E.P., Albelda B., Audrain-McGovern J., Cao W., Kurtz M.M., Gur R.C., Lerman C.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Cardiac And Metabolic Responses To “Space Invaders”: An Instance Of Metabolically‐Exaggerated Cardiac Adjustment?,"Heart rate, plus various ventilatory and metabolic indices, were monitored while 24 male subjects played a computer game of the “space invaders” type and during a control condition, in which analogous but ineffective actions were requested and the game proceeded automatically. Relative to baseline, subjects showed much larger increases in heart rate during “space invaders” than during the control condition. However, oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, respiratory rate and volume also increased more. While the absolute magnitude of metabolic differences between conditions could be regarded as modest relative to heart rate differences, given the effective range of variations possible for each parameter, the existence of highly significant differences in oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production militates against assertions of overall cardiac‐metabolic independence during “space invaders.” Nevertheless, analysis of individual differences in heart rate reactivity would seem to provide some evidence of metabolically‐unjustified heart rate changes during “space invaders.” High heart rate reactors during “space invaders” did not differ from low reactors in either oxygen consumption or carbon dioxide production. In addition, this relatively high heart rate reactivity was specific to the “space invaders” condition; high and low heart rate reactors displayed no differences in heart rate, or in any other physiological measure, during the control condition or during baseline.

,Cardiovascular And Affective Outcomes Of Active Gaming: Using The Nintendo Wii As A Cardiovascular Training Tool,"Naugle, KE, Naugle, KM, and Wikstrom, EA. Cardiovascular and affective outcomes of active gaming: Using the Nintendo Wii as a cardiovascular training tool. J Strength Cond Res 28(2): 443-451, 2014-Active-video gaming is purported to produce similar cardiovascular responses as aerobic fitness activities. This study compared the emotional and cardiovascular effects of Wii games with those of traditional exercise in college-aged adults with different exercise backgrounds. Specifically, the percentage of heart rate reserve, rate of perceived exertion (RPE), level of enjoyment, and Positive and Negative Affect Schedule scores were compared between subjects who reported exercising frequently at high intensities (high-intensity exerciser group: age = 20.18 years [0.87]; Height = 165.23 cm [9.97]; Mass = 62.37 kg [11.61]), N = 11 and those who exercise more often at lower intensities (low-intensity exercisers group: age = 20.72 years [1.19]; Height = 164.39 cm [8.05]; Mass = 68.04 kg [10.71]), N = 11. The subjects completed six 20-minute exercises sessions: treadmill walking, stationary cycling, and Wii's Tennis, Boxing, Cycling, and Step. The low-intensity exerciser group achieved a greater percentage of heart rate reserve (a) during traditional exercise compared with that during Wii boxing, (b) playing Wii boxing compared with that for Wii tennis, and (c) playing Wii boxing compared with that when the high-intensity exercisers group played any Wii games (p > 0.05). The RPE was greater for boxing and cycling compared with that for tennis and step (p > 0.05). Ratings of enjoyment and the increase in positive emotion were greater for boxing and for tennis compared with those for traditional exercises (p > 0.05). Results suggest that Wii boxing shows the greatest potential as a cardiovascular fitness tool among the Wii games, particularly for individuals who typically exercise at lower intensities. © 2014 National Strength and Conditioning Association.",doi,10.1519/JSC.0b1J13e3l829999c3,Scopus,Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research,"Naugle K.E., Naugle K.M., Wikstrom E.A.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali

Blacks showed significantly greater diastolic blood pressure (DBP) responses than Whites during the cold pressor test, which were not accounted for by an increase in plasma catecholamines. Exercise produced reliably greater systolic blood pressure (SBP) increases in Black women than in Black men or White women. Men showed significantly greater SBP and DBP changes than women during the video game.

,Cardiovascular Reactivity In Anger-Defensive Individuals: The Influence Of Task Demands,"This study examined whether the elevated cardiovascular response to stressful stimuli previously suggested for individuals who are defensive in their reporting of anger might be moderated by the demands of the stressor task. Forty male undergraduates were exposed to four tasks: shock avoidance video game, handgrip, film, and cold pressor. Employing cluster analysis, defensive/low anger subjects were identified by high scores on the Marlowe- Crowne Social Desirability scale and low scores on the Spielberger Anger Expression and Trait Anger questionnaires. These individuals exhibited elevated heart rate and systolic blood pressure responses as compared with other subjects, but only to the shock avoidance task. Defensive/low anger subjects also reported less state anger to all tasks. It is proposed that an anger defensive style results in elevated cardiovascular activity only in interaction with stressors that elicit a sympathetic nervous system response and/or involve evaluation threat.",doi,10.1097/00006842-199301000-00013,Scopus,Psychosomatic Medicine,Miller S.B.,1993,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali

Relative to the untrained hypertensives, the trained hypertensives reacted to the video game with marginally smaller systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure, but there were no significant differences between these groups in reactivity during the mental arithmetic task. Comparisons between each hypertensive group and the normotensive group showed that blood pressure (BP) reactivity of normotensives during the video game was generally similar to that of trained hypertensives but smaller than that of untrained hypertensives. These results indicate that aerobic training, which has been found to reduce resting BP in mild hypertensives, may also exert a favorable impact in reducing cardiovascular reactivity of hypertensives during some stressful situations.",doi,10.1037/0278-6133.5.4.407,Scopus,"Health psychology : official journal of the Division of Health Psychology, American Psychological Association","Perkins K.A., Dubbert P.M., Martin J.E., Faulstich M.E., Harris J.K.",1986,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Cardiovascular Reactivity To Stressors In Indian Young Adults With Normotensive Parents,"Backgrounds and Objectives: Stress-induced increase in heart-rate and blood pressure is termed cardiovascular reactivity (CVR). Various studies are designed to monitor the CVR and use different types of experimental stressors. We have compared the CVR to three different stressors used in CVR based studies (cold pressor task, hand grip test, and video game) to identify the best suited stressor for any study design. Material and Methods: The study was conducted on 82 (38 female) young Indian adults with normal resting basal parameters and normotensive parents. Each volunteer was subjected to three stressors: cold pressor task (CPT), hand grip test (HGT), and video game (VG). The CVR to the three stressors was compared amongst female subjects and amongst male subjects by ANOVA, and between female and male subjects by unpaired Student's t-test. Results: Maximum CVR was obtained to HGT, while maximum gender difference in CVR was obtained in case of CPT. Heart rate and blood pressure changes obtained on playing VG were not statistically significant. Conclusion: When the purpose of research is to generate maximum possible CVR, we suggest the use of HGT; while if the purpose of the research is to study gender related differences, the use of CPT would be more appropriate. Unlike young adults of Western countries, VG is not perceived as a challenging task or stressor by young Indian adults and produces little change in heart rate and blood pressure.",doi,10.7860/JCDR/2013/6753.3450,Scopus,Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research,"Verma A., Kumar M., Saxena I., Kumar J.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Cardiovascular Response Of Trained Preadolescent Boys To Mental Challenge,"Purpose: To compare the cardiovascular reactivity response to mental challenge of aerobically trained and untrained preadolescent boys. Methods: Heart rate (HR) and blood pressure, as well as stroke volume, total peripheral resistance, rate pressure product, and cardiac contractility response in 15 aerobically trained (10.3 yr) and 15 untrained (9.5 yr) subjects during and recovering from the Stroop task and a computer game (Tetris) were examined. Cardiac vagal activity was also assessed using time series analysis of heart period variability (HPVts). Results: Untrained compared with trained subjects made significantly more errors during Stroop, whereas performance on Tetris was similar. Trained subjects had significantly lower (P &lt; 0.05) HR and significantly greater cardiac vagal activity at rest. Both groups had significant increases in HR, peripheral resistance, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, rate pressure product, and a significant decrease in vagal activity during Stroop. In contrast, only diastolic blood pressure increased and vagal activity decreased during Tetris. Cardiac contractility of both groups failed to increase during either stressor. Trained compared with untrained subjects had significantly lower absolute HR during and recovering from Stroop. Also HR and vagal activity change, relative to baseline, was significantly greater for the trained during Stroop. During and recovering from Tetris, absolute HR was significantly less for the trained subjects, but change scores were not significantly different. Conclusions: The greater HR and vagal activity change of trained subjects to the Stroop suggests greater cardiac reactivity to mental challenge.",doi,10.1249/01.MSS.0000078935.78895.8E,Scopus,Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise,"Franks P.W., Boutcher S.H.",2003,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Changes In Blood Pressure Reactivity And 24-Hour Blood Pressure Profile Occurring At Puberty,"To evaluate blood pressure reactivity in children and its changes in adolescents, the acute pressor response to a video-game stress test and the noninvasive ambulatory blood pressure monitoring were evaluated in 62 healthy children divided into three age groups. Basal blood pressure values were measured according to the NIH Task Force. With baseline measures and body mass index controlled for, analysis of covariance showed that the video game provoked significant and incremental cardiovascular reac tivity across the games in adolescents when compared with the two other groups of children. The same group of children showed also a significantly higher systolic ambu latory pressure during the daytime, whereas no significant difference was observed by basal BP measurement. In conclusion an increased reactivity to external stimuli was observed in adolescents, and this pattern was strictly associated with a higher daily blood pressure. © 1994, Sage Publications.

,Changes In Sympathetic Tone During Cooperative Game Play,"We investigated the relationship between stress (specifically, sympathetic tone) and effective and efficient cooperation between partners using a cooperative version of a Tetris game as a model of limited resources in a shared environment. Participants were recruited from 2 distinct sociocultural orientations: individualism (Americans) and collectivism (Japanese). We compared the frequency domain of heart rate variability (HRV) and average scores on the short form of the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (I-PANAS-SF) for individuals and dyad partners. Japanese players cooperated more effectively and their scores on the positive subscale of the I-PANAS-SF for both self and partner were higher than those of American players. However, Japanese participants experienced more stress, as indicated by an increased low-to-high HRV frequency ratio. Our results suggest that sociocultural orientation affects the motivation to promote prosocial interactions that result in efficiency and effectiveness of cooperation. © Society for Personality Research.",doi,10.2224/sbp.2015.43.7.1123,Scopus,Social Behavior and Personality,"Adam Noah J., Ono Y., Shimada S., Tachibana A., Bronner S.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Childhood Obesity Study: A Pilot Study Of The Effect Of The Nutrition Education Program Color My Pyramid,"The need for successful nutrition interventions is critical as the prevalence of childhood obesity increases. Thus, this pilot project examines the effect of a nutrition education program, Color My Pyramid, on children's nutrition knowledge, self-care practices, activity levels, and nutrition status. Using a pretest-posttest, quasiexperimental design, 126 fourth- and fifth-grade students from experimental and control schools are compared. The intervention program incorporates an online component www.MyPyramid.gov, Orem's Self-Care Deficit Nursing Theory, and consists of six classes taught over a 3-month period.

,Choosing To Be Afraid: Preferences For Fear As A Function Of Goal Pursuit,"According to an instrumental approach to emotion regulation (M. Tamir, in press), people may not always prefer to feel pleasant emotions and avoid unpleasant ones. Instead, they may be motivated to experience even unpleasant emotions when they might be useful for goal attainment. Given that fear serves to promote successful avoidance, these studies tested this hypothesis by examining preferences for fear in preparation for avoidance goal pursuits. Consistent with the predictions of the instrumental approach, participants preferred to increase their level of fear as they prepared to pursue an avoidance goal. Such preferences were higher than preferences for either excitement or anger and were unique to avoidance (vs. approach or confrontational) goal pursuits. Given the aversive nature of fear, these findings clearly demonstrate that people may sometimes prefer to feel bad if doing so can lead to instrumental benefits. © 2009 American Psychological Association.",doi,10.1037/a0015882,Scopus,Emotion,"Tamir M., Ford B.Q.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,"Code, Nintendo’s Super Mario And Digital Legality","The rise of technology in controlling and performing legal processes has created a new digital legality, signalling a transformation of law from an analog paper-based interpretative activity to an autonomous system governed by the rigidity and speed of code. This emerging digital legality converts life and living to data to be processed and catalogued. This process is exemplified and normalised within video games making them important cultural artefacts through which to identify the features and anxieties of digital legality. While video games have so far gone unrepresented in cultural legal theory, this article uses the iconic video game franchise of Super Mario to unlock the emerging features and anxieties of digital legality as involving rigidity, speed and the normalisation of self as data. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",doi,10.1007/s11196-015-9417-x,Scopus,International Journal for the Semiotics of Law,"Pearson A., Tranter K.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,"Competence-Impeding Electronic Games And Players' Aggressive Feelings, Thoughts, And Behaviors","Recent studies have examined whether electronic games foster aggression. At present, the extent to which games contribute to aggression and the mechanisms through which such links may exist are hotly debated points. In current research we tested a motivational hypothesis derived from self-determination theory-that gaming would be associated with indicators of human aggression to the degree that the interactive elements of games serve to impede players' fundamental psychological need for competence. Seven studies, using multiple methods to manipulate player competence and a range of approaches for evaluating aggression, indicated that competence-impeding play led to higher levels of aggressive feelings, easier access to aggressive thoughts, and a greater likelihood of enacting aggressive behavior. Results indicated that player perceived competence was positively related to gaming motivation, a factor that was, in turn, negatively associated with player aggression. Overall, this pattern of effects was found to be independent of the presence or absence of violent game contents. We discuss the results in respect to research focused on psychological need frustration and satisfaction and as they regard gaming-related aggression literature. © 2013 American Psychological Association.",doi,10.1037/a0034820,Scopus,Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,"Przybylski A.K., Rigby C.S., Deci E.L., Ryan R.M.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Computational Modeling For Addiction Medicine: From Cognitive Models To Clinical Applications,"Decision-making tasks that have good ecological validity, such as simulated gambling tasks, are complex, and performance on these tasks represents a synthesis of several different underlying psychological processes, such as learning from experience, and motivational processes such as sensitivity to reward and punishment. Cognitive models can be used to break down performance on these tasks into constituent processes, which can then be assessed and studied in relation to clinical characteristics and neuroimaging outcomes. Whether it will be possible to improve treatment success by targeting these constituent processes more directly remains unexplored. We review the development and testing of the Expectancy-Valence and Prospect-Valence Learning models from the past 10 years or so using simulated gambling tasks, in particular the Iowa and Soochow Gambling Tasks. We highlight the issues of model generalizability and parameter consistency, and we describe findings obtained from these models in clinical populations including substance use disorders. We then suggest future directions for this research that will help to bring its utility to broader research and clinical applications. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",doi,10.1016/bs.pbr.2015.07.032,Scopus,Progress in Brain Research,"Ahn W.Y., Dai J., Vassileva J., Busemeyer J.R., Stout J.C.",2016,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Computer-Based Cognitive Rehabilitation: The Core System,"Purpose: This work aims at providing a tool for supporting cognitive rehabilitation. This is a wide field, that includes a variety of diseases and related clinical pictures; for this reason the need arises to have a tool available that overcomes the difficulties entailed by what currently is the most common approach, that is, the so-called pen and paper rehabilitation. Methods: We first organized a big number of stimuli in an ontology that represents concepts, attributes and a set of relationships among concepts. Stimuli may be words, sounds, 2D and 3D images. Then, we developed an engine that automatically generates exercises by exploiting that ontology. The design of exercises has been carried on in synergy with neuropsychologists and speech therapists. Solutions have been devised aimed at personalizing the exercises according to both patients’ preferences and performance. Results: Exercises addressed to rehabilitation of executive functions and aphasia-related diseases have been implemented. The system has been tested on both healthy volunteers (n = 38) and patients (n = 9), obtaining a favourable rating and suggestions for improvements. Conclusions: We created a tool able to automate the execution of cognitive rehabilitation tasks. We hope the variety and personalization of exercises will allow to increase compliance, particularly from elderly people, usually neither familiar with technology nor particularly willing to rely on it. The next step involves the creation of a telerehabilitation tool, to allow therapy sessions to be undergone from home, thus guaranteeing continuity of care and advantages in terms of time and costs for the patients and the National Healthcare System (NHS).Implications for rehabilitation Cognitive impairments can greatly impact an individual's existence, appreciably reducing his abilities and autonomy, as well as sensibly lowering his quality of life. Cognitive rehabilitation can be used to restore lost brain function or slow down degenerative diseases. Computerization of rehabilitation entails many advantages, but patients–especially elderly people–might be less prone to the use of technology and consequently reluctant towards this innovative therapeutic approach. Our software system, CoRe, supports a therapist during the administration of rehabilitation sessions: exercises can be generated dynamically, thus reducing repetitivity, and patients' performance trends automatically analysed to facilitate the assessment of their progress. Tests performed on both healthy subjects and patients provided useful information that allowed us to define an implementation strategy able to reduce patients' resistance to computerized rehabilitation as much as possible. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",doi,10.3109/09638288.2015.1096969,Scopus,Disability and Rehabilitation,"Alloni A., Sinforiani E., Zucchella C., Sandrini G., Bernini S., Cattani B., Pardell D.T., Quaglini S., Pistarini C.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Computer Game For Inner-City Children Does Not Improve Asthma Outcomes,"Introduction: The purpose of this randomized control trial was to evaluate the effects of a computer-assisted instructional (CAI) game on asthma symptoms (eg, coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, and nighttime awakenings) in 7- to 12-year-old inner-city children over 12 weeks. Method: A CAI that focused on reducing environmental irritants/allergens and the correct use of prescribed medications to prevent asthma symptoms was used with 101 children (56 in the intervention group and 45 in the control group). The primary outcome evaluated a change in children's asthma symptoms as measured by responses to nine symptom questions in Juniper's Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (PAQOL) and measurements of lung function. Results: No significant changes in asthma symptoms occurred between the two groups before and after the intervention. No significant changes were noted in PAQOL scores for activities, emotions, and total PAQOL score, lung function measurements, and asthma severity between the two groups. Asthma knowledge of both groups was high before intervention, but there were no significant changes between groups after the intervention. Discussion: Findings indicate that this CAI game was not effective in improving asthma symptoms in this group of children.",doi,10.1067/mph.2003.28,Scopus,Journal of Pediatric Health Care,"Huss K., Winkelstein M., Nanda J., Naumann P.L., Sloand E.D., Huss R.W.",2003,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Computer Games To Teach Hygiene: An Evaluation Of The E-Bug Junior Game,"Handwashing, respiratory hygiene and antibiotic resistance remain major public health concerns. In order to facilitate an effective outcome when teaching the basic principles of hand and respiratory hygiene, educational interventions should first target school children. As computer games are ubiquitous in most children's lives, e-Bug developed computer games targeted at teaching children handwashing, respiratory hygiene and antibiotic resistance. The games were designed for two target audiences: junior school children (9-12 year olds); and senior school children (13-15 year olds). Between May and August 2009, the finalized junior game underwent an evaluation in three UK schools (in Glasgow, Gloucester and London), involving 62 children in the schools and ~ 1700 players accessing the junior game online. The e-Bug junior game consists of a number of levels of play, each of which promotes a set of learning outcomes (LOs). These LOs, complementary to those in the e-Bug packs, are expressed through the game mechanics (the rules of the game) rather than through story or dialogue. Although the junior game's evaluation demonstrated a statistically significant change in the knowledge for only a small number of given LOs, because many children had the required knowledge already before playing the game, this is e-Bug's first statistical study on the junior game and the first comprehensive evaluation of its kind. Future work includes a re-examination of the quiz-style questionnaires utilized in this study and an exploration of the potential knowledge change acquired strictly through engagement. © The Author 2011.

,Computerized Respiratory Muscle Training In Children With Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy,"The present study describes the use of simple video games for a 5-week regimen of respiratory muscle training in 15 patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) at various stages of the disease. The games were re-arranged to be operated and driven by the respiratory efforts of the patient and to incorporate accurate ventilation and time measurements. Improvement in respiratory performance was determined by maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV), maximal achieved ventilation (VEmax) during a progressive isocapnic hyperventilation manoeuvre (PIHV) and the PIHV duration. The actual training period was 23 ± 4 days (mean ±S.D.) at ventilatory effort of 46 ± 6% MVV, for 10±3 min day-1. Patients with moderate impairment of lung function tests (LFT) showed an improvement in MVV, V Emax, and duration of PIHV of 12 ± 7% (p &lt; 0.02), 53 ± 25% (p &lt; 0.001) 57 ± 21% (p &lt; 0.01), respectively. Improvements correlated with actual training time and ventilation level, %MVV, but negatively correlated with years of immobilization and with the initial MVV. We conclude that computerized respiratory games may be applied for breathing exercises and may improve respiratory performance in recently immobilized children with DMD who have moderate impairment of LFT. © 1994.",doi,10.1016/0960-8966(94)90026-4,Scopus,Neuromuscular Disorders,"Vilozni D., Bar-Yishay E., Gur I., Shapira Y., Meyer S., Godfrey S.",1994,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Computing Desirable Partitions In Additively Separable Hedonic Games,"An important aspect in systems of multiple autonomous agents is the exploitation of synergies via coalition formation. Additively separable hedonic games are a fundamental class of coalition formation games in which each player has a value for any other player and the value of a coalition to a particular player is simply the sum of the values he assigns to the members of his coalition. In this paper, we consider a number of solution concepts from cooperative game theory, welfare theory, and social choice theory as criteria for desirable partitions in hedonic games. We then conduct a detailed computational analysis of computing, checking the existence of, and verifying stable, fair, optimal, and popular partitions for additively separable hedonic games. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

,"Constructions Of Emotion: Discrepancy, Arousal, And Mood","An interactive adventure-type computer game was used to explore the constructive components of emotional experience - sympathetic nervous system arousal and evaluative cognitions - postulated by discrepancy/evaluation theory. Manipulations of expectations produced significant and large heart rate changes for both positive and negative discrepancies. Autonomic response also reflected the degree of interruption/discrepancy produced by an event. Negatively toned (discrepant) events tended to produce significant intensity and higher overall autonomic arousal. In addition, subjects' intensity of experience was related to their autonomic response. © 1989 Plenum Publishing Corporation.",doi,10.1007/BF00992957,Scopus,Motivation and Emotion,"MacDowell K.A., Mandler G.",1989,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,"Cool, Callous And In Control: Superior Inhibitory Control In Frequent Players Of Video Games With Violent Content.","Research on the effects of media violence exposure has shown robust associations among violent media exposure, increased aggressive behavior, and decreased empathy. Preliminary research indicates that frequent players of violent video games may have differences in emotional and cognitive processes compared to infrequent or nonplayers, yet research examining the amount and content of game play and the relation of these factors with affective and cognitive outcomes is limited. The present study measured neural correlates of response inhibition in the context of implicit attention to emotion, and how these factors are related to empathic responding in frequent and infrequent players of video games with graphically violent content. Participants completed a self-report measure of empathy as well as an affective stop-signal task that measured implicit attention to emotion and response inhibition during electroencephalography. Frequent players had lower levels of empathy as well as a reduction in brain activity as indicated by P100 and N200/P300 event related potentials. Reduced P100 amplitude evoked by happy facial expressions was observed in frequent players compared to infrequent players, and this effect was moderated by empathy, such that low levels of empathy further reduced P100 amplitudes for happy facial expressions for frequent players compared to infrequent players. Compared to infrequent players, frequent players had reduced N200/P300 amplitude during response inhibition, indicating less neural resources were recruited to inhibit behavior. Results from the present study illustrate that chronic exposure to violent video games modulates empathy and related neural correlates associated with affect and cognition.",doi,10.1093/scan/nsx115,pubmed,Social cognitive and affective neuroscience,"Stockdale, Laura; Morrison, Robert G; Palumbo, Robert; Garbarino, James; Silton, Rebecca L",2017,NA,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Cooperation Dynamics On Collaborative Social Networks Of Heterogeneous Population,"In collaborative social networks (CSNs), autonomous individuals cooperate for their common reciprocity interests. The intrinsic heterogeneity of individuals' capability and willingness makes significant impact on the promotion of cooperation rate. In this paper, we propose a two-phase Heterogeneous Public Goods Game (HPGG) model to study the cooperation dynamics in CSNs. We introduce two factors to represent the heterogeneity of individual behaviors and the benefit-to-cost enhancement of population, respectively. Based on HPGG CSN model, we quantitatively investigate the relationship between cooperation rate and individuals' heterogeneous behaviors from an evolutionary game perspective. Simulations on the population structure of scale-free networks show the evolution of cooperation in CSNs has no-trivial dependence on the individuals' heterogeneous behaviors. Compared with standard PGG and single-phase heterogeneous PGG, HPGG provides a more precise mechanism to promote cooperation rate of CSNs. Finally, data traces collected from real experiments also demonstrate the preciseness of HPGG in formulating the cooperation dynamics on CSNs. © 1983-2012 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/JSAC.2013.130615,Scopus,IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications,"Wei G., Zhu P., Vasilakos A.V., Mao Y., Luo J., Ling Y.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Cooperative Mission Planning For Multi-Uav Teams,"The use of robotic agents, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), has motivated the development of numerous autonomous cooperative task allocation and planning methods for heterogeneous networked teams. Typically agents within the team have different roles and responsibilities, and ensuring proper coordination between them is critical for efficient mission execution. However, as the number of agents, system components, and mission tasks increase, planning for such teams becomes increasingly complex, motivating the development of algorithms that can operate in real-time dynamic environments. Given the complexity of the cooperative missions considered, there have been numerous solution approaches developed in recent years. This chapter provides an overview of three of the most common planning frameworks: integer programming, Markov decision processes, and game theory. The chapter also considers various architectural decisions that must be addressed when implementing online planning systems for multi-agent teams, providing insights on when centralized, distributed, and decentralized architectures might be good choices for a given application, and how to organize the communication and computation to achieve desired mission performance. Algorithms that can be utilized within the various architectures are identified and discussed, and future directions for research are suggested. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015.",doi,10.1007/978-90-481-9707-116,Scopus,Handbook of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,"Ponda S.S., Johnson L.B., Geramifard A., How J.P.",2015,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Coordinated Pursuer Control Using Particle Filters For Autonomous Search-And-Capture,"In a real-world pursuit-evasion (PE) game, the pursuers often have a limited field-of-view of the evaders and thus are required to search for and detect the evaders before capturing them. This paper presents a unified framework and control algorithm using particle filters (PFs) for the coordination of multiple pursuers to search for and capture multiple evaders given the ability of PF to estimate highly non-Gaussian densities prevalent in search problems. The pursuer control problem is formulated as a stochastic control problem where global objectives function of both searching and capturing are common. To take the evaders' actions into account, an action measure (AM) is defined over the evaders' PDs is used to represent the probability that the evader may transit each state in the PD. The global objective functions for search and capture are then decomposed into local objective functions for unification through objective priority weights. Coordination between the pursuers takes place through the multi-sensor update where the observation likelihoods of all pursuers are used in the PF update stage. The control actions of each pursuer are then determined individually, based on the updated PDs given the objective weights, action measures as well as evader importance weights in the case of multiple evaders. The proposed algorithm is tested in three scenarios for its effectiveness. In addition, a parametric study on the average capture time against the initial variances of the target state uncertainty is conducted to test for robustness. Results show that the pursuers are able to capture all the evaders in each case with the capture time for the second and last scenario differing by only 2.9% implying firstly that under the proposed algorithm, the capture time is not proportional to the increase in the number of evaders and also suggested robustness and potential scalability of the proposed algorithm. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

,Coronary Thrombosis An Environmental Study,"The object of the study was to ascertain, if possible, any environmental feature influencing the death rate from coronary thrombosis between the ages of 45 and 64 years. Records were taken of the age, sex, and occupations of persons normally resident in the administrative county of Cheshire who died between these ages from June, 1956, to December, 1959, and an inquiry was carried out over a period of 17 months into the medical history and environmental particulars of 536 persons who had died aged 45 to 64 years from coronary thrombosis, and the results were compared with similar information from 642 controls of the same sex and age-erouos taken at random. The answers received indicate that approximately three-fifths of those who had died had been receiving medical treatment, though not necessarily for a cardiac condition for longer than six months. There was no evidence to establish that family circumstances, holidays, consumption of fat, alcohol, or tea, times of meals or of rising or going to bed, participation in sport or games, visits to club or hotel, employment (in the case of women), addiction to radio or television, overtime or night working, and whether the job was manual or not, heavy or light, affect the likelihood of death from coronary thrombosis. Only a very small percentage (2%) of men controls who had not received medical treatment in the past three years travelled more than 6 miles (9.6 km.) in each direction between home and work. The death rate among farmers and agricultural workers was much lower in middle age than that of any other socio-economic group, whether from general causes or from coronary thrombosis. Work involving walking, and gardening in leisure, lessened liability to death from coronary thrombosis. The death rate was highest among sedentary workers, particularly clerks. To hold a position of responsibility at work does not carry an increased risk. There was a higher death rate from coronary disease among smokers, but no evidence to suggest an association between death from coronary disease and pipe smoking. Evidence suggested that overweight among manual workers is associated with increased liability to death from coronary thrombosis. There were significantly fewer deaths among coffee drinkers. A number of observations, based on subjective evidence and therefore subject to suspicion, raise the possibility that psychological and temperamental factors, particularly worry, may increase liability to death from coronary disease. Heredity, so far as could be deduced from such an inqniry asthis is an influence. The answers to the questions show that there is no need for a person to restrict himself or herself from those ordinary pleasures of life discussed in this paper in order to avoid death from coronary thrombosis. © 1962, British Medical Journal Publishing Group.

,"Correlates And Consequences Of Exposure To Videogame Violence: Hostile Personality, Empathy, And Aggressive Behavior.","Research has shown that exposure to violent video games causes increases in aggression, but the mechanisms of this effect have remained elusive. Also, potential differences in short-term and long-term exposure are not well understood. An initial correlational study shows that video game violence exposure (VVE) is positively correlated with self-reports of aggressive behavior and that this relation is robust to controlling for multiple aspects of personality. A lab experiment showed that individuals low in VVE behave more aggressively after playing a violent video game than after a nonviolent game but that those high in VVE display relatively high levels of aggression regardless of game content. Mediational analyses show that trait hostility, empathy, and hostile perceptions partially account for the VVE effect on aggression. These findings suggest that repeated exposure to video game violence increases aggressive behavior in part via changes in cognitive and personality factors associated with desensitization.",doi,10.1177/0146167205277205,anderson2010,Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin,"Bartholow, B.

,Cortisol Effects On Flow-Experience,"Rationale: Stress affects flow-experience, but the mediating psychobiological mechanisms remain unknown. Previous studies showed an association between flow-experience and endogenous cortisol levels, suggesting an inverted, u-shaped relation between flow-experience and cortisol. However, these studies could not exclude effects of other stress factors. Objectives: The aim of this experiment was, therefore, to test the isolated effect of cortisol on flow-experience, independent of concomitant physiological and psychological stress responses, via controlled administration of exogenous cortisol. Methods: Sixty-four young healthy subjects (32 males, 32 females) participated in the experiment. According to a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over design, they received 20 mg oral cortisol on 1 day and placebo on the other day, respectively, with a time distance of 1 week between the experimental days. One hour after cortisol administration, participants engaged in the computer game Pacman. Pacman was delivered in five blocks of randomly differing difficulty levels. One block lasted 5 min. At the end of each block, participants rated flow-experience by the Flow Short Scale. Data was analyzed with hierarchical linear modeling. Subjects were not able to predict whether the pill they received contained cortisol or placebo. Results: Overall, results revealed a negative effect of oral 20 mg cortisol on flow-experience, with no differences between males and females. Conclusions: This study is the first to show that exogenous cortisol in a dose corresponding to a severe stressor impairs flow-experience. The observed negative effect of high cortisol dosage on experienced flow underlines recent findings of an inverted u-shaped relationship between cortisol and flow. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",doi,10.1007/s00213-014-3753-5,Scopus,Psychopharmacology,"Peifer C., Schächinger H., Engeser S., Antoni C.H.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Costs And Benefits Of Autonomy When Learning A Task: An Experimental Approach,"Previous findings suggested that the positive relationship between autonomy and learning outcomes (such as improved task performance) only holds up until a certain optimum level of autonomy has been reached. This assumption was investigated in an experimental study where 95 participants had to learn a computer task. During the learning phase, we manipulated autonomy, distinguishing among no, moderate, and full autonomy. The results revealed that, when learning a task, having autonomy is preferred to having no autonomy. However, increases in autonomy beyond a certain level (i.e., full versus moderate autonomy) will not yield additional advantages regarding the motivation to learn and learning outcomes, and may have disadvantages in terms of learning efficiency.

,"Critical Decision-Speed And Information Transfer In The ""Graz Brain-Computer Interface""","The ""Graz Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) "" transforms changes in oscillatory EEG activity into control signals for external devices and feedback. These changes are induced by various motor imageries performed by the user. For this study, 2 different types of motor imagery (movement of the right vs. left hand or both feet) were classified by processing 2 bipolar EEG-channels (derived at electrode positions C3 and C4). After a few sessions, within some weeks, 4 young paraplegic patients learned to control the BCI. In accordance with the participants, decision-speed (trial length) was varied and the information transfer rate (ITR) was calculated for each run. All experimental runs have been feedback-runs employing a simple computer-game-like paradigm. A falling ball had to be led into a randomly marked target halfway down the screen. The horizontal position was controlled by the BCI-output signal and the trial length was varied by the investigator across runs. The goal was to find values for trial length enabling a maximum ITR. Three out of 4 participants had good results after a few runs. Analysis of their last 2 experimental sessions, each containing between 10 and 16 runs, showed that the trial length can be reduced to values around 2 s to obtain the highest possible information transfer.

,Critical Theory Of Communication Technology: Introduction To The Special Section,"The debate over the contribution of new communication technology to democracy is far from settled. Some point to the empowering effects of online discussion and fund-raising on recent electoral campaigns in the United States to argue that the Internet will restore the public sphere. Others claim that the Internet is just a virtual mall, a final extension of capitalist rationalization into every corner of our lives, a trend supported by an ever denser web of surveillance technologies threatening individual autonomy in the advanced societies of the West. This introduction to the special section on critical theory of communication technology argues for the democratic thesis with some qualifications. The most important contribution of new technology to democracy is not necessarily its effects on the conventional political process but rather its ability to assemble a public around technical networks that enroll individuals scattered over wide geographical areas. Communities of medical patients, video game players, musical performers, and many other groups have emerged on the Internet with surprising consequences.

,Cue Reactivity And Its Inhibition In Pathological Computer Game Players,"Despite a rising social relevance of pathological computer game playing, it remains unclear whether the neurobiological basis of this addiction-like behavioral disorder and substance-related addiction are comparable. In substance-related addiction, attentional bias and cue reactivity are often observed. We conducted a functional magnetic resonance study using a dot probe paradigm with short-presentation (attentional bias) and long-presentation (cue reactivity) trials in eight male pathological computer game players (PCGPs) and nine healthy controls (HCs). Computer game-related and neutral computer-generated pictures, as well as pictures from the International Affective Picture System with positive and neutral valence, served as stimuli. PCGPs showed an attentional bias toward both game-related and affective stimuli with positive valence. In contrast, HCs showed no attentional bias effect at all. PCGPs showed stronger brain responses in short-presentation trials compared with HCs in medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and anterior cingulate gyrus and in long-presentation trials in lingual gyrus. In an exploratory post hoc functional connectivity analyses, for long-presentation trials, connectivity strength was higher between right inferior frontal gyrus, which was associated with inhibition processing in previous studies, and cue reactivity-related regions (left orbitofrontal cortex and ventral striatum) in PCGPs. We observed behavioral and neural effects in PCGPs, which are comparable with those found in substance-related addiction. However, cue-related brain responses were depending on duration of cue presentation. Together with the connectivity result, these findings suggest that top-down inhibitory processes might suppress the cue reactivity-related neural activity in long-presentation trials. © 2012 Society for the Study of Addiction.",doi,10.1111/j.1369-1600.2012.00491.x,Scopus,Addiction Biology,"Lorenz R.C., Krüger J.-K., Neumann B., Schott B.H., Kaufmann C., Heinz A., Wüstenberg T.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Current Ways To Harvest Energy Using A Computer Mouse,"This paper deals with the idea of an energy harvesting (EH) system that uses the mechanical energy from finger presses on the buttons of a computer mouse by means of a piezomaterial (PVF2). The piezomaterial is placed in the mouse at the interface between the button and the body. This paper reviews the parameters of the PVF2 piezomaterial and tests their possible implementation into EH systems utilizing these types of mechanical interactions. The paper tests the viability of two EH concepts: a battery management system, and a semi-autonomous system. A statistical estimate of the button operations is performed for various computer activities, showing that an average of up to 3300 mouse clicks per hour was produced for gaming applications, representing a tip frequency of 0.91 Hz on the PVF2 member. This frequency is tested on the PVF2 system, and an assessment of the two EH systems is reviewed. The results show that fully autonomous systems are not suitable for capturing low-frequency mechanical interactions, due to the parameters of current piezomaterials, and the resulting very long startup phase. However, a hybrid EH system which uses available power to initiate the circuit and eliminate the startup phase may be explored for future studies. © Czech Technical University in Prague, 2014.",doi,10.14311/AP.2014.54.0019,Scopus,Acta Polytechnica,"Horvat F., Cekan M., Soltes L., Biath P., Hucko B., Jedinak I.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Dance Experience Sculpts Aesthetic Perception And Related Brain Circuits,"Previous research on aesthetic preferences demonstrates that people are more likely to judge a stimulus as pleasing if it is familiar. Although general familiarity and liking are related, it is less clear how motor familiarity, or embodiment, relates to a viewer's aesthetic appraisal. This study directly compared how learning to embody an action impacts the neural response when watching and aesthetically evaluating the same action. Twenty-two participants trained for 4 days on dance sequences. Each day they physically rehearsed one set of sequences, passively watched a second set, listened to the music of a third set, and a fourth set remained untrained. Functional MRI was obtained prior to and immediately following the training period, as were affective and physical ability ratings for each dance sequence. This approach enabled precise comparison of self-report methods of embodiment with nonbiased, empirical measures of action performance. Results suggest that after experience, participants most enjoy watching those dance sequences they danced or observed. Moreover, brain regions involved in mediating the aesthetic response shift from subcortical regions associated with dopaminergic reward processing to posterior temporal regions involved in processing multisensory integration, emotion, and biological motion. © 2014 The Authors.",doi,10.1111/nyas.12634,Scopus,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,"Kirsch L.P., Dawson K., Cross E.S.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,"Death With A Story: How Story Impacts Emotional, Motivational, And Physiological Responses To First-Person Shooter Video Games","This study investigates how game playing experience changes when a story is added to a first-person shooter game. Dependent variables include identification, presence, emotional experiences and motivations. When story was present, game players felt greater identification, sense of presence, and physiological arousal. The presence of story did not affect self-reported arousal or dominance. This study clearly demonstrates that story is something that video game players enjoy; it helps involve them in the game play, makes them feel more immersed in the virtual environment, and keeps them aroused. The greater character identification may be especially worrisome, as past research has shown that justified media violence disinhibits actual aggression on the part of the audience.",doi,10.1093/hcr/30.3.361,Scopus,Human Communication Research,"Schneider E.F., Lang A., Shin M., Bradley S.D.",2004,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Design And Implementation Of An Autonomous Robot Soccer System,"A design and implementation method of a robot soccer system with three vision-based autonomous robots is proposed in this paper. A hierarchical architecture with four independent layers: (a) information layer, (b) strategy layer, (c) tactics layer, and (d) execution layer, is proposed to construct a flexible and robust vision-based autonomous robot soccer system efficiently. Five mechanisms, including (a) a two-dimensional neck mechanism, (b) dribbling mechanism, (c) shooting mechanism, (d) aiming mechanism, and (e) flexible movement mechanism, are proposed to mean the robot with multiple functions can win the game. A method based on data obtained from a compass and a vision sensor is proposed to determine the location of the robot on the field. In the strategy design, a hierarchical architecture of decision based on the finite-state transition mechanism for the field players and the goalkeeper is proposed to solve varied situations in the robot soccer game. Three vision-based robots are implemented and some real competition results in the FIRA Cup are presented to illustrate the validity and feasibility of the proposed method in autonomous robot soccer system design. © 2013 Cheng et al.",doi,10.5772/56189,Scopus,International Journal of Advanced Robotic Systems,"Wong C.-C., Cheng C.-T., Chan H.-M.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Design And Testing Of A Novel Interactive Playground Device,"The concept of an interactive playground was born out of the specific need to tackle increasing levels of childhood obesity in the UK. A worryingly high proportion of children are inactive, preferring to spend their leisure time playing sedentary computer games or other electronic gaming devices. To engage this specific user group, an interactive, whole-body outdoor play device was devised. The device is intended to promote 'stealth fitness' with an aim to improve user's reaction time, coordination, agility, and cardiovascular fitness. This paper describes the design and experimentation phases undertaken to develop the device from an initial concept to a final product. Fifteen healthy children completed an experimental study consisting of three 5-min sessions. Heart rate was continuously monitored and ratings of enjoyment, competence, and perceived exertion were recorded after each session. The results indicate that using the new device elicits a large cardiovascular response while providing high levels of enjoyment. © IMechE 2008.",doi,10.1243/09544054JEM952SC,Scopus,"Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part B: Journal of Engineering Manufacture","Hodgkins P., Caine M., Rothberg S., Spencer M., Mallison P.",2008,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Detecting Emotional State Of A Child In A Conversational Computer Game,"The automatic recognition of user's communicative style within a spoken dialog system framework, including the affective aspects, has received increased attention in the past few years. For dialog systems, it is important to know not only what was said but also how something was communicated, so that the system can engage the user in a richer and more natural interaction. This paper addresses the problem of automatically detecting ""frustration"", ""politeness"", and ""neutral"" attitudes from a child's speech communication cues, elicited in spontaneous dialog interactions with computer characters. Several information sources such as acoustic, lexical, and contextual features, as well as, their combinations are used for this purpose. The study is based on a Wizard-of-Oz dialog corpus of 103 children, 7-14 years of age, playing a voice activated computer game. Three-way classification experiments, as well as, pairwise classification between polite vs. others and frustrated vs. others were performed. Experimental results show that lexical information has more discriminative power than acoustic and contextual cues for detection of politeness, whereas context and acoustic features perform best for frustration detection. Furthermore, the fusion of acoustic, lexical and contextual information provided significantly better classification results. Results also showed that classification performance varies with age and gender. Specifically, for the ""politeness"" detection task, higher classification accuracy was achieved for females and 10-11 years-olds, compared to males and other age groups, respectively. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.csl.2009.12.004,Scopus,Computer Speech and Language,"Yildirim S., Narayanan S., Potamianos A.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Development And Validation Of A Smartphone Heart Rate Acquisition Application For Health Promotion And Wellness Telehealth Applications,"Objective. Current generation smartphones' video camera technologies enable photoplethysmographic (PPG) acquisition and heart rate (HR) measurement. The study objective was to develop an Android application and compare HRs derived from a Motorola Droid to electrocardiograph (ECG) and Nonin 9560BT pulse oximeter readings during various movement-free tasks. Materials and Methods. HRs were collected simultaneously from 14 subjects, ages 20 to 58, healthy or with clinical conditions, using the 3 devices during 5-minute periods while at rest, reading aloud under observation, and playing a video game. Correlation between the 3 devices was determined, and Bland-Altman plots for all possible pairs of devices across all conditions assessed agreement. Results. Across conditions, all device pairs showed high correlations. Bland-Altman plots further revealed the Droid as a valid measure for HR acquisition. Across all conditions, the Droid compared to ECG, 95 of the data points (differences between devices) fell within the limits of agreement. Conclusion. The Android application provides valid HRs at varying levels of movement free mental/perceptual motor exertion. Lack of electrode patches or wireless sensor telemetric straps make it advantageous for use in mobile-cell-phone-delivered health promotion and wellness programs. Further validation is needed to determine its applicability while engaging in physical movement-related activities. Copyright © 2012 Mathew J.

,Development Of A Telemetry System For Measuring Oxygen Uptake During Sports Activities,"A new system for continuous measurement of oxygen uptake by means of a telemeter has been developed. Oxygen uptake and pulmonary ventilation during rest and exercise were determined using a portable oxygen consumption meter (Oxylog). A small interface circuit between the Oxylog and the transmitter of a frequency modulated bio-telemeter system was designed and installed inside the Oxylog. Data from the transmitter were passed to a receiver and were fed into a microcomputer system. The microcomputer system displayed and printed out minute values of ventilation and oxygen uptake. The accuracy and reliability of the new system were checked by comparison with the traditional (Douglas bag) method. In the range &lt;801· min-1 of ventilation and &lt;21· min-1 of oxygen uptake, the system was not inferior to the Douglas bag method. The new system was applied for field continuous measurement of oxygen uptake during a doubles tennis game. The results of the application indicate that the telemetry system developed here is a very practical and useful way of measuring oxygen uptake during sports activities. © 1988 Springer-Verlag.",doi,10.1007/BF00418473,Scopus,European Journal of Applied Physiology and Occupational Physiology,"Ikegami Y., Hiruta S., Ikegami H., Miyamura M.",1988,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Development Of Emotion Recognition Interface Using Complex Eeg/Ecg Bio-Signal For Interactive Contents,"With the changes in the interface paradigm, a user may not be satisfied using only a behavior-based interface such as a mouse and keyboard. In this paper, we propose a real-time user interface with emotion recognition that depends on the need for skill development to support a change in the interface paradigm to one that is more human centered. The proposed emotion recognition technology may provide services to meet the need to recognize emotions when using contents. Until now, most studies on an emotion recognition interface have used a single signal, which was difficult to apply because of low accuracy. In this study, we developed a complex biological signal emotion recognition system that blends the ratio of an ECG for the autonomic nervous system and the relative power value of an EEG (theta, alpha, beta, and gamma) to improve the low accuracy. The system creates a data map that stores user-specific probabilities to recognize six kinds of feelings (amusement, fear, sadness, joy, anger, and disgust). It updates the weights to improve the accuracy of the emotion corresponding to the brain waves of each channel. In addition, we compared the results of the complex biological signal data set and EEG data set to verify the accuracy of the complex biological signal, and found that the accuracy had increased by 35.78%. The proposed system will be utilized as an interface for controlling a game and smart space for a user with high accuracy. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",doi,10.1007/s11042-016-4203-7,Scopus,Multimedia Tools and Applications,"Shin D., Shin D., Shin D.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali

,"Digital Game Playing And Direct And Indirect Aggression In Early Adolescence: The Roles Of Age, Social Intelligence, And Parent–Child Communication.","The roles of age, social intelligence and parent-child communication in moderating the association between digital game playing and direct and indirect aggression were examined in 478 Finnish 10- and 13-year-old schoolchildren based on self-reports. The results confirmed that digital game violence was directly associated with direct aggression, especially at age 10, but only among boys. The moderating role of social intelligence was substantiated among older boys: game violence was associated with indirect aggression among those with high level of social intelligence. Further, as hypothesized, digital game playing was associated with direct aggression especially when parent-child communication was poor, but only among boys. Our findings emphasize the importance of individual and situational factors as moderators of the link between game violence and aggression.",doi,10.1007/s10964-006-9151-5,anderson2010,Journal of Youth & Adolescence,"Wallenius, M., Punamaki, R.

,Diminished Pulse Pressure Response To Psychological Stress: Early Precursor Of Essential Hypertension?,"An excessive blood pressure response to mental stress is a widely reported characteristic of young normotensive offspring of hypertensive parents. At odds with these reports are data from a large biracial study showing that high risk adolescent offspring had diminished pulse pressure under mental stress and no evidence of greater blood pressure reactivity. We examined this apparent contradiction in a similar but larger sample of 213 normotensive adolescents, comparing blood pressure and heart rate responses to video game, mirror drawing, mental arithmetic, interview, and physical exercise in high- and low-risk offspring. Results replicated the diminished pulse pressure finding, suggesting it is characteristic of African Americans and is evoked by behavioral tasks that entail skeletal-motor inhibition. Submaximal physical exercise failed to discriminate between offspring groups. Possible biologic correlates of diminished pulse pressure in black adolescents with 'high normal' blood pressure warrant further investigation.",doi,10.1097/00006842-199207000-00006,Scopus,Psychosomatic Medicine,"Ewart C.K., Kolodner K.B.",1992,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Distraction As A Measure Of Presence: Using Visual And Tactile Adjustable Distraction As A Measure To Determine Immersive Presence Of Content In Mediated Environments,"To assess and improve the user experience in entertainment products, developers need results of evaluation methods, which in detail measure the relationship between the mediated content and the resulting media experience. This paper proposes a method applying adjustable distraction (AD) to determine presence as immersion (Lombard and Ditton in At the heart of it all: the concept of presence, Department of Broadcasting, Telecommunications and Mass Media, Temple University, 1997) at selectable events (approximated real-time). Two experiments were conducted to investigate its applicability in computer games and movies with respectively visual and tactile AD. The first experiment examined whether the experienced intensity in a survival-shooter game, measured through questionnaires, was proportional to results from the AD method. The intrusiveness of the AD method was also addressed in the experiment by comparing the immersive presence ratings in a between-groups design. The second experiment investigated whether heart rate measurements, intensity ratings and the results of the AD method with vibration as the distraction signal were proportional when test participants watched a movie clip. The outcome of the first experiment indicated that no significant intrusion is caused by the method. In addition, results showed no proportionality between the AD method and intensity ratings. However, as the AD measurements were supported by flow theory, it might be that the results from the AD method using visual distraction are giving a more comprehensive indication of presence as immersion (rather than just the intensity dimension). The second experiment revealed proportionality between the intensity ratings and the heart rate measurements, while the results from the tactile AD method were not proportional. We suspect that this was caused by the great variance found across the test participants' thresholds of perceivable vibration. Because of this, it is suggested that a thorough screening process is conducted pre-test if the AD method should apply vibration as the distracting stimulus. © 2009 Springer-Verlag London Limited.",doi,10.1007/s10055-009-0140-3,Scopus,Virtual Reality,"Nordahl R., Korsgaard D.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Do Prospect-Based Emotions Enhance Believability Of Game Characters? A Case Study In The Context Of A Dice Game,"To endow game characters with more realistic affective behavior, the notion of prospect-based emotions plays an important role: recent literature suggests that emotional states of such agents should not only be triggered by present stimuli, but also by anticipation on future stimuli, and evaluation of past stimuli in the context of these anticipations. Within the current study, an extension of the belief-desire-intention (BDI) model with prospect-based emotions is proposed, and is evaluated with respect to its capabilities of enhancing believability of game characters. The model has been implemented in the modeling language LEADSTO. In addition, a game application has been developed, in which a user can play a two games (tic-tac-toe and a game of dice) against an agent that is equipped with the emotion-based model. An empirical evaluation indicates that the model significantly enhances the agent's believability, in particular concerning its involvement in the situation. © 2013 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/T-AFFC.2013.30,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing,"Bosse T., Zwanenburg E.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Does A Nintendo Wii Exercise Program Provide Similar Exercise Demands As A Traditional Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program In Adults With Copd?,"Background and Aims: The chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) population can experience lower activity and fitness levels than the non-COPD population. The Nintendo Wii may be an appropriate at-home training device for the COPD population, which could be used as a supplement for a pulmonary rehabilitation program. This study was a randomized, within-subject, cross-over study involving 10 adults with COPD previously enrolled in St Paul's Hospital's pulmonary rehabilitation program. This study attempted to determine if specific Wii activities resulted in similar energy expenditures to that of a more traditional pulmonary rehabilitation activity. Methods: Participants completed two 15-min exercise interventions in a single session, with a washout period of 30min in-between. The interventions were an experimental Wii intervention and a traditional treadmill intervention. Results: There was no significant difference in total energy expenditure between the two 15-min exercise interventions [mean difference 36.3 joules; 95% confidence interval (CI): 31.4, 104]. There was no significant difference in heart rate (mean difference -0.167 beats per minute; 95% CI: -4.83, 4.50), rating of perceived exertion (mean difference 0.100; 95% CI: -0.416, 0.616) and Borg dyspnea scale (mean difference 0.267; 95% CI: -0.004, 0.537) between the two 15-min exercise interventions. There was a significant difference in SpO2 between the two 15-min exercise interventions (Wii intervention mean difference 2.33%&gt;treadmill intervention; 95% CI: 1.52, 3.15). Conclusion: Gaming technology can provide an exercise program that has similar cardiovascular demands to traditional pulmonary rehabilitation programs for patients with COPD.

,Does Excessive Play Of Violent First-Person-Shooter-Video-Games Dampen Brain Activity In Response To Emotional Stimuli?,"The present case-control study investigated the processing of emotional pictures in excessive first-person-shooter-video-players and control persons. All participants of the fMRI experiment were confronted with pictures from four categories including pleasant, unpleasant, neutral content and pictures from the first-person-shooter-video-game 'Counterstrike'. Compared to controls, gamers showed a significantly lower activation of the left lateral medial frontal lobe while processing negative emotions. Another interesting finding of the study represents the higher activation of frontal and temporal brain areas in gamers when processing screen-shots from the first-person-shooter-video-game 'Counterstrike'. Higher brain activity in the lateral prefrontal cortex could represent a protection mechanism against experiencing negative emotions by down-regulating limbic brain activity. Due to a frequent confrontation with violent scenes, the first-person-shooter-video-gamers might have habituated to the effects of unpleasant stimuli resulting in lower brain activation. Individual differences in brain activations of the contrast Counterstrike > neutral pictures potentially resemble the activation of action-scripts related to the video-game. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",doi,10.1016/j.biopsycho.2011.09.014,Scopus,Biological Psychology,"Montag C., Weber B., Trautner P., Newport B., Markett S., Walter N.T., Felten A., Reuter M.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Does Playing Violent Video Games Induce Aggression. Empirical Evidence Of A Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study.,"This study aims to advance the media effects debate concerning violent video games. Meta-analytic reviews reveal a small but noticeable association between playing violent video games and aggressive reactions. However, evidence for causal associations is still rare. In a novel, event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging study, 13 male research participants were observed playing a latest-generation violent video game. Each participant's game play was recorded and content analyzed on a frame-by-frame basis. Onscreen activities were coded as either ""passive/dead, no interactions""; ""active/safe, no imminent danger/no violent interactions""; ""active/potential danger occurs, violent interactions expected""; ""active/under attack, some violent interactions""; and ""active/fighting and killing, many violent interactions."" Previous studies in neuroscience on aggressive thoughts and behaviors suggested that virtual violence would suppress affective areas of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the amygdala subsequent to activity variations at cognitive areas of the ACC. Comparison of game play activities with and without virtual violence in 11 participants confirmed the hypothesis. The rather large observed effects can be considered as caused by the virtual violence. We discuss the applicability of neuroscience methodology in media effects studies, with a special emphasis on the assumption of virtuality prevalent in video game play.",doi,10.1207/S1532785XMEP0801_4,anderson2010,Media Psychology,"Weber, R., Ritterfeld, U., Mathiak, K.",2006,NA,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Does Preschool Physical Activity And Electronic Media Use Predict Later Social And Emotional Skills At 6 To 8 Years? A Cohort Study,"Background: Little is known about the associations of preschoolers' health behaviors with their later psychosocial wellbeing. This study investigates the association of 3- to 5-year-old children's physical activity and electronic media use with their later social-emotional skills (6-8 years). Methods: Data were collected in 2008-2009 and 2011-2012 for the Healthy Active Preschool and Primary Years (HAPPY) Study in metropolitan Melbourne. Participants were a random subsample (n = 108) of the 567 children at follow-up. Physical activity was objectively measured using ActiGraph GT1M accelerometers; electronic media use (television viewing, sedentary electronic games and active electronic games) was parent proxy-reported. Social and emotional skills were child-reported using the Bar-On Emotional Quotient Inventory-Youth Version. Regression analyses controlled for sex, clustering by center of recruitment, and accelerometer wear time (for physical activity analyses). Results: Sedentary electronic games were positively associated with intrapersonal and stress management skills and total emotional quotient. Computer/internet use was inversely associated with interpersonal, and positively associated with stress management, skills. Conclusions: Findings suggest that physical activity is not associated with children's psychosocial health while some types of electronic media use are. Future research should investigate the contexts in which preschoolers participate in these behaviors and potential causal mechanisms of associations. © 2017 Human Kinetics, Inc.",doi,10.1123/jpah.2015-0700,Scopus,Journal of Physical Activity and Health,"Hinkley T., Timperio A., Salmon J., Hesketh A.K.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Dynamic Hierarchical Reactive Controller Synthesis,"In the formal approach to reactive controller synthesis, a symbolic controller for a possibly hybrid system is obtained by algorithmically computing a winning strategy in a two-player game. Such game-solving algorithms scale poorly as the size of the game graph increases. However, in many applications, the game graph has a natural hierarchical structure. In this paper, we propose a modeling formalism and a synthesis algorithm that exploits this hierarchical structure for more scalable synthesis. We define local games on hierarchical graphs as a modeling formalism that decomposes a large-scale reactive synthesis problem in two dimensions. First, the construction of a hierarchical game graph introduces abstraction layers, where each layer is again a two-player game graph. Second, every such layer is decomposed into multiple local game graphs, each corresponding to a node in the higher level game graph. While local games have the potential to reduce the state space for controller synthesis, they lead to more complex synthesis problems where strategies computed for one local game can impose additional requirements on lower-level local games. Our second contribution is a procedure to construct a dynamic controller for local game graphs over hierarchies. The controller computes assume-admissible winning strategies that satisfy local specifications in the presence of environment assumptions, and dynamically updates specifications and strategies due to interactions between games at different abstraction layers at each step of the play. We show that our synthesis procedure is sound: the controller constructs a play that satisfies all local specifications. We illustrate our results through an example controlling an autonomous robot in a building with known floor plan and provide simulation results using an implementation of our algorithm on top of LTLMoP. © 2017, The Author(s).",doi,10.1007/s10626-017-0239-8,Scopus,Discrete Event Dynamic Systems: Theory and Applications,"Schmuck A.-K., Majumdar R., Leva A.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Dysfunction Of The Frontolimbic Region During Swear Word Processing In Young Adolescents With Internet Gaming Disorder,"Although the Internet is an important tool in our daily life, the control of Internet use is necessary to address difficult problems. This study set out with the aim of assessing the cognitive control of affective events in Internet gaming disorder (IGD) and has examined the influence of IGD on neural activities with regard to swear words in young adolescents. We demonstrated the differences between adolescents with IGD and healthy control adolescents (HC) with respect to swear, negative and neutral word conditions. Swear words induced more activation in regions related to social interaction and emotional processing such as the superior temporal sulcus, right temporoparietal junction and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) when compared with negative words. In this study, adolescents with IGD exhibited reduced activation in the right OFC related to cognitive control and in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) related to social rejection during the swear word condition. In addition, adolescents with IGD were negatively correlated with activity in the right amygdala toward swear words, indicating the important role of the amygdala in the control of aggression in adolescents with IGD. These findings enhance our understanding of social-emotional perception in adolescents with IGD.",doi,10.1038/tp.2015.106,Scopus,Translational Psychiatry,"Chun J.-W., Choi J., Cho H., Lee S.-K., Kim D.J.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Effect Of Manipulated State Aggression On Pain Tolerance,"Swearing produces a pain lessening (hypoalgesic) effect for many people; an emotional response may be the underlying mechanism. In this paper, the role of manipulated state aggression on pain tolerance and pain perception is assessed. In a repeated-measures design, pain outcomes were assessed in participants asked to play for 10 minutes a first-person shooter video game vs a golf video game. Sex differences were explored. After playing the first-person shooter video game, aggressive cognitions, aggressive affect, heart rate, and cold pressor latency were increased, and pain perception was decreased. These data indicate that people become more pain tolerant with raised state aggression and support our theory that raised pain tolerance from swearing occurs via an emotional response. © Psychological Reports 2012.",doi,10.2466/16.02.20.PR0.111.4.311-321,Scopus,Psychological Reports,"Stephens R., Allsop C.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali

,Effectiveness Of A Home-Based Active Video Game Programme In Young Cystic Fibrosis Patients.,"Exercise-based rehabilitation is already a part of cystic fibrosis (CF) treatment; however, patient adherence is low. To assess the effectiveness of a home exercise programme using active video games (AVGs) as a training modality for children and adolescents with CF. Thirty-nine children with CF were randomised to a control group (CG, n = 20, age 11 ± 6 years; FEV1 86.2 ± 20.5% of predicted) or a training group (AVGG, n = 19, age 13 ± 3 years; FEV1 82.7 ± 21.7% of predicted). The home training protocol consisted of 30- to 60-min sessions, 5 days/week, for 6 weeks using a Nintendo Wii™ platform. Exercise capacity was measured by the 6-min walk test (6MWT) and modified shuttle walk test (MSWT); muscular strength was estimated using the horizontal jump test (HJT), medicine ball throw (MBT), and hand grip strength (right [RHG]; left [LHG]); and quality of life was rated using the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R). All the children were measured at baseline, after rehabilitation, and at 12 months. For the group × time interaction ANOVAs, the AVGG showed significant between-group differences in exercise capacity: 6MWT farthest walking distance, 38.4 m (p < 0.01); MSWT farthest walking distance, 78.4 m (p < 0.05); and muscular strength: HJT 9.8 cm, MBT 30.8 cm, RHG 7 kg, and LHG 6.5 kg (p < 0.01), before versus after intervention. The CFQ-R reported significantly higher scores on respiratory symptoms after the intervention and favoured the AVGG, and there was an improvement in other domains after 12 months.

,Effects Of Gender And Game Type On Autonomic Nervous System Physiological Parameters In Long-Hour Online Game Players,"Online game playing may induce physiological effects. However, the physical mechanisms that cause these effects remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to examine the physiological effects of long-hour online gaming from an autonomic nervous system (ANS) perspective. Heart rate variability (HRV), a valid and noninvasive electrocardiographic method widely used to investigate ANS balance, was used to measure physiological effect parameters. This study used a five-time, repeated measures, mixed factorial design. Results found that playing violent games causes significantly higher sympathetic activity and diastolic blood pressure than playing nonviolent games. Long-hour online game playing resulted in the gradual dominance of the parasympathetic nervous system due to physical exhaustion. Gaming workload was found to modulate the gender effects, with males registering significantly higher sympathetic activity and females significantly higher parasympathetic activity in the higher gaming workload group. © Copyright 2013, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2013.",doi,10.1089/cyber.2012.0230,Scopus,"Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking",Lin T.-C.,2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Effects Of Goal-Related Motivational States On The Orienting Of Spatial Attention,"Three experiments are presented indicating that motivational processes arising from incentive and feedback signals exert specific effects on the orienting of visual spatial attention. Subjects played a video game in which targets were presented in one of two peripheral locations. Pre-target cues were employed to orient attention to a location where points could be gained (positive incentive cue), to a location where points could be lost (negative incentive cue) or to neither location (neutral cue). Cost-benefit analyses were used to assess the consequences of such orienting. Although there was no evidence of general attentional biases favoring positive over negative incentives, all three experiments demonstrated an interaction between the incentive value of the current trial and the outcome of the previous trial. Following unsuccessful outcomes, attentional costs were greater for positive than negative incentives, whereas following successful outcomes, costs were larger for negative than positive cues. This pattern was evident for tasks involving detection, perceptual discrimination and memory scanning. These findings are discussed in light of contemporary models of motivation and the control of attention. © 1989.",doi,10.1016/0001-6918(89)90029-2,Scopus,Acta Psychologica,Derryberry D.,1989,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,"Effects Of Load Stressors, Cognitive Complexity And Type A Coronary Prone Behavior On Visual-Motor Task Performance","In two separate experiments, 25 and 42 adult working males participated in a visual-motor task modeled on a video game. The game was designed to permit measurement of strategy, risk taking, errors committed, and overall task performance. Predictions of complexity theory for task performance were supported. In the second experiment, participants were divided into four subgroups on the basis of Type A versus Type B coronary-prone behavior (measured on the structured interview) and on the basis of unidimensional versus multidimensional responding (measured by a complexity interview with stems of the sentence completion test). Type A coronary-prone behavior did not contribute to differences in visual-motor performance. More multidimensional persons exceeded their unidimensional counterparts, especially in the application of strategy. The extension of complexity theory approaches to simpler tasks is discussed. It is noted that the frequently voiced assumptions of Type A individuals-that their behavior style tends to lead to higher performance levels-is not supported. © 1985 American Psychological Association.",doi,10.1037/0022-3514.48.3.728,Scopus,Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,"Streufert S., Streufert S.C., Denson A.L.",1985,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,"Effects Of Pacing, Status And Unbalance In Time Motion Variables, Heart Rate And Tactical Behaviour When Playing 5-A-Side Football Small-Sided Games","Objectives: To compare time-motion variables, heart rate and players' tactical behaviour according to game pace (slow, normal or fast), status (winning and losing) and team unbalance (superiority and inferiority) in football 5-a-side small-sided games. To identify the most discriminating variables in classifying performances according to these constraints. Design: Cross-sectional field study. Methods: The data were gathered using global positioning systems (5. Hz) in 5-a-side small-sided games (7. ×. 5. min) played by twenty-four footballers. The tactical performance was measured using dynamical positioning variables, processed by non-linear signal processing techniques (approximate entropy). ANOVA models were used to compare between constraints and discriminant analyses to identify the variables that best discriminate between pacing and status. ×. unbalance constraints. Results: The fast paced games had the highest mean speed value, followed by normal and slow paced games (8.2±0.6kmh-1, 7.8±0.5kmh-1 and 6.2±0.4kmh-1, respectively). The stronger predictor variables of pacing were the randomness in distance to team centroid and the distances covered above 13kmh-1. The results also changed according to game status and team unbalance. The strongest predictor variables were the distance covered bellow 6.9kmh-1, distance and randomness to team centroid, with higher values when winning in superiority conditions. Conclusions: Practice task design manipulating game pace, status and team unbalance significantly influenced the emergent behavioural dynamics. Collective positioning variables were more accurate in discriminating these constraints and, therefore, need to be considered when planning and monitoring performance. © 2013 Sports Medicine Australia.",doi,10.1016/j.jsams.2013.04.005,Scopus,Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport,"Sampaio J.E., Lago C., Gonçalves B., Maçãs V.M., Leite N.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Effects Of Playing Video Games On Children’s Aggressive And Other Behaviors.,"Noting the pervasiveness of videogames in American culture, the authors set out to examine the effects that playing videogames has on children. Thirty-one children were matched on sex, randomly assigned to play either a violent (karate) videogame or a nonviolent (jungle vine swinging) videogame, and then observed during free play. The main results were that the children who had played the jungle swing videogame later played more with a jungle swing toy and that the children who played the violent videogame later showed more aggression. The authors interpreted the findings as an indication that young children who play videogames later tend to act similarly to how their videogame character acted.",doi,10.1111/j.1559-1816.1988.tb00028.x,anderson2010,Journal of Applied Social Psychology,"Schutte, N.

,Effects Of Playing Video Games On Pain Response During A Cold Pressor Task,"Two studies assessed whether playing video games would significantly distract participants from painful stimulation via a cold pressor test. In Study 1, participants (8 men, 22 women, M age= 18.5 yr., SD= 1.3) in an action-oriented game condition tolerated pain for a longer time period and reported lower pain intensity ratings than those in a nonaction-oriented game or a nongame control condition. No differences were found on scores of aggressiveness, competitiveness, or prior video game experience, suggesting that these factors play little role. In Study 2, participants (14 men, 13 women, M age= 19.7 yr., SD= 1.3) engaged in six video game conditions (action, fighting, puzzle, sports, arcade, and boxing) and a nongame control condition. Video game play produced an increase in pulse, which was greatest during the action, fighting, sports, and boxing games. Pain tolerance was greatest during the sports and fighting games. Thus, certain games produce greater distraction, which may have implications for the medical field as an adjunct to pain management. © Perceptual and Motor Skills 2009.",doi,10.2466/PMS.108.2.439-448,Scopus,Perceptual and Motor Skills,"Raudenbush B., Koon J., Cessna T., McCombs K.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Effects Of Playing Violent Computer Games On Emotional Desensitization And Aggressive Behavior,"This study analyzed the effects of playing a violent computer game on emotional desensitization and aggressive behavior. College students (N=58) were randomly assigned to play a violent game (VG) or a nonviolent game (NVG), and then were exposed to a set of emotional pictures. Participants' physiological responses were recorded, and the Self-Assessment Manikin scale was used to assess affective valence and arousal while viewing the pictures. Participants were then asked to replay the game, after which aggressive behavior was measured. Participants' violent game habits (VGH) were also measured. We found that VG playing interacted with participants' VGH to influence aggression, and that self-reported valence mediated this effect by lowering the feelings of pleasure and displeasure toward emotional stimuli. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc..",doi,10.1111/j.1559-1816.2011.00791.x,Scopus,Journal of Applied Social Psychology,"Arriaga P., Monteiro M.B., Esteves F.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali

Results of hierarchical regression analyses showed sustained relationships between exposure and pro-violent attitudes and empathy when exposure was examined simultaneously with gender, computer use, and Internet use. However, the linkage between exposure and aggression became non-significant, suggesting that the effects of playing violent videogames were greater for attitudinal outcomes than on overt behavior.

,"Effects Of Realism On Extended Violent And Nonviolent Video Game Play On Aggressive Thoughts, Feelings, And Physiological Arousal","Previous research has shown that playing violent video game exposure can increase aggressive thoughts, aggressive feelings, and physiological arousal. This study compared the effects that playing a realistic violent, unrealistic violent, or nonviolent video game for 45 min has on such variables. For the purpose of this study, realism was defined as the probability of seeing an event in real life. Participants (N=74; 39 male, 35 female) played either a realistic violent, unrealistic violent, or nonviolent video game for 45 min. Aggressive thoughts and aggressive feelings were measured four times (every 15 min), whereas arousal was measured continuously. The results showed that, though playing any violent game stimulated aggressive thoughts, playing a more realistic violent game stimulated significantly more aggressive feelings and arousal over the course of play. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",doi,10.1002/ab.20279,Scopus,Aggressive Behavior,"Barlett C.P., Rodeheffer C.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali

A total of 71 children aged 8 to 12 years played a paper-and-pencil game, a nonviolent video game, and a violent video game. Results indicate that arousal, as measured by heart rate and self-reported arousal, increased significantly after playing the violent video game, as compared with the other two game conditions, with girls reporting more arousal than did boys. There was no significant increase in aggressive mood scores for either boys or girls after playing the violent game. Positive mood, as measured by positive affect, showed no significant increases or decreases after playing either video game. However, positive mood, as measured by general mood, showed a significant increase after playing the violent game for both boys and girls, but only as compared with the paper-and-pencil game.

,Electrodermal Response In Gaming,"Steady improvements in technologies that measure human emotional response offer new possibilities for making computer games more immersive. This paper reviews the history of designs a particular branch of affective technologies that acquire electrodermal response readings from human subjects. Electrodermal response meters have gone through continual improvements to better measure these nervous responses, but still fall short of the capabilities of today's technology. Electrodermal response traditionally have been labor intensive. Protocols and transcription of subject responses were recorded on separate documents, forcing constant shifts of attention between scripts, electrodermal measuring devices and of observations and subject responses. These problems can be resolved by collecting more information and integrating it in a computer interface that is, by adding relevant sensors in addition to the basic electrodermal resistance reading to untangle (1) body resistance; (2) skin resistance; (3) grip movements; other (4) factors affecting the neural processing for regulation of the body. A device that solves these problems is presented and discussed. It is argued that the electrodermal response datastreams can be enriched through the use of added sensors and a digital acquisition and processing of information, which should further experimentation and use of the technology. © Copyright 2011 J.

,Emg-Based Analysis Of Change In Muscle Activity During Simulated Driving,"Extensive usage of computers could cause fatigue and even lead to musculo-skeletal injuries. Onset of fatigue can be determined by analyzing biosignals like surface electromyogram (sEMG), electrocardiogram (ECG), electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrooculogram (EOG). Physiological parameters such as pressure, respiration rate and oxygen debt have also been used to estimate the onset of fatigue and recovery time. Other than these measures, behavioral analysis using video and subjective analysis have also been used extensively to detect onset of fatigue. In this study, muscle activity changes in the shoulder and neck muscles while gaming in an automobile simulator, using sEMG, are analyzed. Two groups of professional and non-professional drivers participated in this study. Statistically significant (p<0.05) change in muscle activity is found in both the groups during a short duration (15 min) of gaming. Such analysis can be used to identify weak muscles in subjects, which can be used as an input for necessary rehabilitation or training programs. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

,Emotion Understanding And Performance During Computer-Supported Collaboration,"Individuals collaborating around and through computers benefit from receiving information that helps them understand one another, which is often termed awareness. This article explores what collaborators understand about each other's emotions and the potential benefits for performance that might come from raising this understanding. In Experiment 1 co-located collaborators judged each other's emotions after playing a game that required cooperative data collection and analysis. Their judgements were largely inaccurate and based on their own emotions, suggesting limited emotion understanding. Experiment 2 explored if this could be overcome by making collaborators aware of each other's emotions. Co-located and remote collaborators played a cooperative puzzle-solving game under conditions of awareness or no awareness. Awareness was manipulated by making collaborators share their self-reported emotions during key moments of their game play. Both remote and co-located collaborators improved their performance after sharing their emotions. However, unlike co-located collaborators, remote collaborators also improved their understanding of each other's emotions and experienced more positive affect. We conclude by discussing the content of collaborators' emotion understanding and the probable mechanisms underlying the observed effects of being made aware of a partner's emotions. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

,"Emotion, Content, And Context In Sound And Music","Computer game sound is particularly dependent upon the use of both sound artefacts and music. Sound and music are media rich in information. Audio and music processing can be approached from a range of perspectives which may or may not consider the meaning and purpose of this information. Computer music and digital audio are being advanced through investigations into emotion, content analysis, and context, and this chapter attempts to highlight the value of considering the information content present in sound, the context of the user being exposed to the sound, and the emotional reactions and interactions that are possible between the user and game sound. We demonstrate that by analysing the information present within media and considering the applications and purpose of a particular type of information, developers can improve user experiences and reduce overheads while creating more suitable, efficient applications. Some illustrated examples of our research projects that employ these theories are provided. Although the examples of research and development applications are not always examples from computer game sound, they can be related back to computer games. We aim to stimulate the reader's imagination and thought in these areas, rather than attempt to drive the reader down one particular path. © 2011, IGI Global.",doi,10.4018/978-1-61692-828-5.ch012,Scopus,Game Sound Technology and Player Interaction: Concepts and Developments,"Cunningham S., Grout V., Picking R.",2010,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Emotional And Adrenocortical Regulation In Early Adolescence: Prediction By Attachment Security And Disorganization In Infancy,"The aim of the present study was to examine differences in emotion expression and emotion regulation in emotion-eliciting situations in early adolescence from a bio-psycho-social perspective, specifically investigating the influence of early mother-infant attachment and attachment disorganization on behavioural and adrenocortical responses. The sample consisted of 96 children of the Regensburg Longitudinal Study IV. At age 12 months, attachment security and disorganization were assessed in the Strange Situation. At age 12 years, the adolescents were observed together with their mother during a computer game (eliciting anger) and the ""Talk Show Task"" (eliciting fear). Analyses included self-ratings and mother-ratings of the adolescents' emotions (anger and fear), observations of the adolescents' emotional expression and emotional regulation (social regulation, effective regulation) as well as concurrent maternal emotional support. In addition, adrenocortical activity was assessed from saliva samples before and after observation. The findings revealed different patterns of social-emotional responses depending on early attachment security. Adolescents with secure infant attachment reported more anger, when anger was induced, were rated as less anxious by their mothers, and their emotion self-ratings were more similar to their mothers' ratings compared to adolescents with an early insecure attachment. An increased adrenocortical response was only found in the group of adolescents with attachment disorganization in infancy, especially with increased fear. © The Author(s) 2014.",doi,10.1177/0165025414520808,Scopus,International Journal of Behavioral Development,"Spangler G., Zimmermann P.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,"Emotional Engagement, Social Interactions, And The Development Of An Afterschool Game Design Curriculum","This formative design study examines how a program curriculum and implementation was emergently (re)designed in dynamic relation to the expressed emotions of teachers and students. The context was a yearlong afterschool game design program for STEM learning at an urban and public all-girls middle school. Using Randall Collins’ (Interaction ritual chains, Princeton University Press, Princeton, 2004) sociology of emotions framework, our analysis of field notes and video data reveal how the original intended curriculum hindered the generation of positive emotions, mutual foci of attention, and feelings of group solidarity—factors important in the generation of successful group interactions. In response to teacher and student expressed emotions, we took these factors as a guide for redesigning the program curriculum and implementation in order to foster a more positive emotional climate and redirect students’ positive emotions toward engagement in learning goals. This study’s implications point to the possibilities for designing curricula and program implementations to engender more emotionally responsive environments for STEM learning. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",doi,10.1007/s11422-014-9621-0,Scopus,Cultural Studies of Science Education,"Kwah H., Milne C., Tsai T., Goldman R., Plass J.L.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Emotional Expression In Simple Line Drawings Of A Robot's Face Leads To Higher Offers In The Ultimatum Game,"In the present study, we investigated whether expressing emotional states using a simple line drawing to represent a robot's face can serve to elicit altruistic behavior from humans. An experimental investigation was conducted in which human participants interacted with a humanoid robot whose facial expression was shown on an LCD monitor that was mounted as its head (Study 1). Participants were asked to play the ultimatum game, which is usually used to measure human altruistic behavior. All participants were assigned to be the proposer and were instructed to decide their offer within 1 min by controlling a slider bar. The corners of the robot's mouth, as indicated by the line drawing, simply moved upward, or downward depending on the position of the slider bar. The results suggest that the change in the facial expression depicted by a simple line drawing of a face significantly affected the participant's final offer in the ultimatum game. The offers were increased by 13% when subjects were shown contingent changes of facial expression. The results were compared with an experiment in a teleoperation setting in which participants interacted with another person through a computer display showing the same line drawings used in Study 1 (Study 2). The results showed that offers were 15% higher if participants were shown a contingent facial expression change. Together, Studies 1 and 2 indicate that emotional expression in simple line drawings of a robot's face elicits the same higher offer from humans as a human telepresence does. © 2017 Terada and Takeuchi.",doi,10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00724,Scopus,Frontiers in Psychology,"Terada K., Takeuchi C.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali

,Entertainment Capture Through Heart Rate Activity In Physical Interactive Playgrounds,"An approach for capturing and modeling individual entertainment (""fun"") preferences is applied to users of the innovative Playware playground, an interactive physical playground inspired by computer games, in this study. The goal is to construct, using representative statistics computed from children's physiological signals, an estimator of the degree to which games provided by the playground engage the players. For this purpose children's heart rate (HR) signals, and their expressed preferences of how much ""fun"" particular game variants are, are obtained from experiments using games implemented on the Playware playground. A comprehensive statistical analysis shows that children's reported entertainment preferences correlate well with specific features of the HR signal. Neuro-evolution techniques combined with feature set selection methods permit the construction of user models that predict reported entertainment preferences given HR features. These models are expressed as artificial neural networks and are demonstrated and evaluated on two Playware games and two control tasks requiring physical activity. The best network is able to correctly match expressed preferences in 64% of cases on previously unseen data (p-value 6 • 10-5). The generality of the methodology, its limitations, its usability as a real-time feedback mechanism for entertainment augmentation and as a validation tool are discussed. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",doi,10.1007/s11257-007-9036-7,Scopus,User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction,"Yannakakis G.N., Hallam J., Lund H.H.",2008,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali

,Ethical Aspects Of Brain Computer Interfaces: A Scoping Review.,"Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a set of technologies that are of increasing interest to researchers. BCI has been proposed as assistive technology for individuals who are non-communicative or paralyzed, such as those with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or spinal cord injury. The technology has also been suggested for enhancement and entertainment uses, and there are companies currently marketing BCI devices for those purposes (e.g., gaming) as well as health-related purposes (e.g., communication). The unprecedented direct connection created by BCI between human brains and computer hardware raises various ethical, social, and legal challenges that merit further examination and discussion. To identify and characterize the key issues associated with BCI use, we performed a scoping review of biomedical ethics literature, analyzing the ethics concerns cited across multiple disciplines, including philosophy and medicine. Based on this investigation, we report that BCI research and its potential translation to therapeutic intervention generate significant ethical, legal, and social concerns, notably with regards to personhood, stigma, autonomy, privacy, research ethics, safety, responsibility, and justice. Our review of the literature determined, furthermore, that while these issues have been enumerated extensively, few concrete recommendations have been expressed. We conclude that future research should focus on remedying a lack of practical solutions to the ethical challenges of BCI, alongside the collection of empirical data on the perspectives of the public, BCI users, and BCI researchers.",doi,10.1186/s12910-017-0220-y,pubmed,BMC medical ethics,"Burwell, Sasha; Sample, Matthew; Racine, Eric",2017,NA,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Ethnic Differences In The Myocardial And Vascular Reactivity To Stress In Normotensive Girls,"Cardiovascular reactivity to stress has been proposed as a mechanism partially responsible for the increased prevalence of essential hypertension in African-Americans compared with whites. However, few studies have examined ethnic differences in cardiovascular reactivity among women. The present study evaluated potential ethnic differences in the cardiovascular reactivity to three laboratory stressors (postural change, video game challenge, forehead cold stimulation). The sample consisted of 171 normotensive girls (74 whites, 97 African-Americans) with a mean age of 11.1 ± 2.7 years, all with positive family histories of essential hypertension. African-American girls showed higher resting diastolic blood pressures and higher resting total peripheral resistance compared with white girls. African-American girls also exhibited higher peak responses in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and total peripheral resistance and lower cardiac index responses during video game challenge and forehead cold stressor. The findings extend previous observations of ethnic differences in blood pressure reactivity to stress and indicate that concomitant increases in total peripheral resistance appear to account for the greater blood pressure reactivity in African-American girls.

,Evaluation Of Tv Commercials Using Neurophysiological Responses,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, neuroscientific knowledge has been applied to marketing as a novel and efficient means to comprehend the cognitive and behavioral aspects of consumers. A number of studies have attempted to evaluate media contents, especially TV commercials using various neuroimaging techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG). Yet neurophysiological examination of detailed cognitive and affective responses in viewers is still required to provide practical information to marketers. Here, this study develops a method to analyze temporal patterns of EEG data and extract affective and cognitive indices such as happiness, surprise, and attention for TV commercial evaluation.METHODS: Twenty participants participated in the study. We developed the neurophysiological indices for TV commercial evaluation using classification model. Specifically, these model-based indices were customized using individual EEG features. We used a video game for developing the index of attention and four video clips for developing indices of happiness and surprise. Statistical processes including one-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) and the cross validation scheme were used to select EEG features for each index. The EEG features were composed of the combinations of spectral power at selected channels from the cross validation for each individual. The Fisher's linear discriminant classifier (FLDA) was used to estimate each neurophysiological index during viewing four different TV commercials. Post hoc behavioral responses of preference, short-term memory, and recall were measured.RESULTS: Behavioral results showed significant differences for all preference, short-term memory rates, and recall rates between commercials, leading to a 'high-ranked' commercial group and a 'low-ranked' group (P < 0.05). Neural estimation of happiness results revealed a significant difference between the high-ranked and the low-ranked commercials in happiness index (P < 0.01). The order of rankings based on happiness and attention matched well with the order of behavioral response rankings. In the elapsed-time analysis of the highest-ranked commercial, we could point to visual and auditory semantic structures of the commercial that induced increases in the happiness index.CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that the neurophysiological indices developed in this study may provide a useful tool for evaluating TV commercials.",doi,10.1186/s40101-015-0056-4,Scopus,Journal of physiological anthropology,"Yang T., Lee D.-Y., Kwak Y., Choi J., Kim C., Kim S.-P.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Excessive Users Of Violent Video Games Do Not Show Emotional Desensitization: An Fmri Study,"Playing violent video games have been linked to long-term emotional desensitization. We hypothesized that desensitization effects in excessive users of violent video games should lead to decreased brain activations to highly salient emotional pictures in emotional sensitivity brain regions. Twenty-eight male adult subjects showing excessive long-term use of violent video games and age and education matched control participants were examined in two experiments using standardized emotional pictures of positive, negative and neutral valence. No group differences were revealed even at reduced statistical thresholds which speaks against desensitization of emotion sensitive brain regions as a result of excessive use of violent video games. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",doi,10.1007/s11682-016-9549-y,Scopus,Brain Imaging and Behavior,"Szycik G.R., Mohammadi B., Hake M., Kneer J., Samii A., Münte T.F., te Wildt B.T.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Exercise Intensity Levels In Children With Cerebral Palsy While Playing With An Active Video Game Console,"Background. Children with cerebral palsy (CP) are prone to secondary complications related to physical inactivity and poor cardiorespiratory capacity. This problem could be greatly attenuated through the use of video games that incorporate physical activity for 2 reasons: Video games already represent an important component of leisure time in younger people, and such games can lead to a high level of exercise intensity in people who are healthy. Objective. The study objective was to evaluate exercise intensity in children with spastic diplegic CP and children who were typically developing while playing with an active video game console. Design. This was a cross-sectional study. Methods. Ten children (7-12 years old) with spastic diplegic CP (Gross Motor Function Classification System level I or II) and 10 children who were age matched and typically developing were evaluated in a movement analysis laboratory. Four games were played with the active video game console (jogging, bicycling, snowboarding, and skiing) for 40 minutes. Heart rate was recorded during the entire playing period with a heart rate belt monitor. Exercise intensity was defined as the percentage of heart rate reserve (HRR). In addition, lower extremity motion analysis was carried out during the final minute of the playing period for the jogging and bicycling games. Results. No difference between groups was observed for any variables. A main effect of games was observed for the amount of time spent at an intensity greater than 40% of HRR. Specifically, more than 50% of the playing time for the jogging game and more than 30% of the playing time for the bicycling game were spent at an intensity greater than 40% of HRR. In addition, the jogging game produced a larger range of motion than the bicycling game. Limitations. A limitation of this study was the relatively small and heterogeneous sample. Conclusions. For all 4 games, similar exercise intensity levels were observed for children who were typically developing and children with CP, suggesting that children with CP could obtain exercise-related benefits similar to those obtained by children without CP while playing with an active video game console. © 2013 American Physical Therapy Association.",doi,10.2522/ptj.20120204,Scopus,Physical Therapy,"Robert M., Ballaz L., Hart R., Lemay M.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Exergaming To Increase The Exercise Capacity And Daily Physical Activity In Heart Failure Patients: A Pilot Study,"Background: Regular daily physical activity is recognised as important in heart failure (HF) patients, but adherence to physical activity is low (<50%). To improve adherence to exercise in HF patients, alternative approaches to motivate and increase self-efficacy to exercise are needed. Therefore, we have studied a new phenomenon: exergames (games to improve physical exercise). The aims of the study were to assess the influence of the exergame platform Nintendo Wii on exercise capacity and daily physical activity in heart failure patients, to study factors related to exercise capacity and daily physical activity, and to assess patients' adherence to exergaming. Methods: A 12-week pilot study with a pretest-posttest design was conducted. The intervention consisted of an instruction on how to use the Wii and 12 weeks' access to Wii at home. The main variables tested were exercise capacity (measured with a six-minute walking test), daily physical activity (measured with an activity monitor), and time exergaming (daily self-report with a diary). Bivariate correlations were used to assess associations between symptom experience, self-efficacy, motivation, anxiety, and depression. Results: In total, 32 heart failure patients were included. More than half of the patients (53%) significantly increased their exercise capacity after 12 weeks. No significant difference was found in daily physical activity between baseline and 12 weeks. Lower NYHA class and shorter time since diagnosis were factors significantly related to the increase in exercise capacity. The daily mean time spent exergaming was 28 minutes, and having grandchildren and being male were related to more time spent exergaming. Conclusion: Exergaming has the potential to increase exercise capacity in elderly, chronically ill cardiac patients. Although the daily physical activity did not change over time, exergaming was feasible for heart failure patients and might be a rehabilitation option for patients with heart failure. © 2014 Klompstra et al.",doi,10.1186/1471-2318-14-119,Scopus,BMC Geriatrics,"Klompstra L., Jaarsma T., Strömberg A.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Experimental Study Of The Differential Effects Of Playing Versus Watching Violent Video Games On Children’s Aggressive Behavior.,"There is great concern about the effects of playing violent video games on aggressive behavior. The present experimental study was aimed at investigating the differential effects of actively playing vs. passively watching the same violent video game on subsequent aggressive behavior. Fifty-seven children aged 10–13 either played a violent video game (active violent condition), watched the same violent video game (passive violent condition), or played a non-violent video game (active non-violent condition). Aggression was measured through peer nominations of real-life aggressive incidents during a free play session at school. After the active participation of actually playing the violent video game, boys behaved more aggressively than did the boys in the passive game condition. For girls, game condition was not related to aggression. These findings indicate that, specifically for boys, playing a violent video game should lead to more aggression than watching television violence. Aggr.

,Exploiting Agents For Modelling And Simulation Of Coverage Control Protocols In Large Sensor Networks,"A sensor network is composed of low-cost, low-power nodes densely deployable over a (possibly in-hospitable) territory in order to monitor the state of the environment, e.g. temperature, sound, radiation and so forth. Sensors have the ability to self-organize into an interconnected network and to cooperate for collecting, aggregating and disseminating information to end users. Major challenges in dealing with sensor networks are the strong limitations imposed by finite onboard power capacity. This paper proposes a lightweight actor infrastructure that is well-suited to modelling and simulation of complex sensor networks and, more in general, of multi-agent systems. This infrastructure is exploited for designing and implementing an efficient actor-based distributed simulation model for studying specific aspects of large wireless sensor networks. The paper proposes and compares the performances of two protocols for the coverage control problem that achieve their objective as an emergent property. In particular, one of the two protocols adopts a novel approach based on an evolutionary game. Distributed simulation of the achieved actor-based models is characterized by good execution performances witnessed by reported experimental results. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

,Exposure To Hot And Cold Environmental Conditions Does Not Affect The Decision Making Ability Of Soccer Referees Following An Intermittent Sprint Protocol,"Soccer referees enforce the laws of the game and the decisions they make can directly affect match results. Fixtures within European competitions take place in climatic conditions that are often challenging (e.g., Moscow ~ -5°C, Madrid ~30°C). Effects of these temperatures on player performance are well-documented; however, little is known how this environmental stress may impair cognitive performance of soccer referees and if so, whether exercise exasperates this. The present study aims to investigate the effect of cold [COLD; -5°C, 40% relative humidity (RH)], hot (HOT; 30°C, 40% RH) and temperate (CONT; 18°C, 40% RH) conditions on decision making during soccer specific exercise. On separate occasions within each condition, 13 physically active males; either semi-professional referees or semi-professional soccer players completed three 90 min intermittent treadmill protocols that simulated match play, interspersed with 4 computer delivered cognitive tests to measure vigilance and dual task capacity. Core and skin temperature, heart rate, rating of perceived exertion (RPE) and thermal sensation (TS) were recorded throughout the protocol. There was no significant difference between conditions for decision making in either the dual task (interaction effects: FALSE p = 0.46; MISSED p = 0.72; TRACKING p = 0.22) or vigilance assessments (interaction effects: FALSE p = 0.31; HIT p = 0.15; MISSED p = 0.17) despite significant differences in measured physiological variables (skin temperature: HOT vs. CONT 95% CI = 2.6 to 3.9, p < 0.001; HOT vs. COLD 95% CI = 6.6 to 9.0, p < 0.001; CONT vs. COLD 95% CI = 3.4 to 5.7, p < 0.01). It is hypothesized that the lack of difference observed in decision making ability between conditions was due to the exercise protocol used, as it may not have elicited an appropriate and valid soccer specific internal load to alter cognitive functioning. © 2014 Taylor, Fitch, Castle, Watkins, Aldous, Sculthorpe, Midgely, Brewer and Mauger.",doi,10.3389/fphys.2014.00185,Scopus,Frontiers in Physiology,"Taylor L., Fitch N., Castle P., Watkins S., Aldous J., Sculthorpe N., Midgely A., Brewer J., Mauger A.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,"Expressive, But Not Neurotic Hostility Is Related To Cardiovascular Reactivity During A Hostile Competitive Task",Several dimensions of hostility have been related to coronary heart disease (CHD) and cardiovascular (CV) reactivity. Neuroticism and dimensions of hostility associated with neuroticism have generally been unrelated to CHD. The present study examined relationships between the expressive and neurotic hostility components of the Buss-Durkee Hostility Inventory (BDHI) and CV reactivity in 25 men and 18 women undergraduate students. Subjects competed against and were harassed by a confederate during competition on a video game. Subjects with expressive hostility scores above the median had higher SBP and heart rate (HR) reactivity than subjects with scores below the median. Neurotic hostility was not related to CV reactivity. The results support the hypothesis that CV reactivity may be a risk factor in the development of CHD and suggest that attempts to relate dimensions of hostility to CV reactivity may be more successful if dimensions of hostility unrelated to neuroticism are studied. © 1993.,doi,10.1016/0191-8869(93)90093-I,Scopus,Personality and Individual Differences,"Felsten G., Leitten C.L.",1993,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Fairness In Multi-Agent Systems,"Multi-agent systems are complex systems in which multiple autonomous entities, called agents, cooperate in order to achieve a common or personal goal. These entities may be computer software, robots, and also humans. In fact, many multi-agent systems are intended to operate in cooperation with or as a service for humans. Typically, multi-agent systems are designed assuming perfectly rational, self-interested agents, according to the principles of classical game theory. Recently, such strong assumptions have been relaxed in various ways. One such way is explicitly including principles derived from human behavior. For instance, research in the field of behavioral economics shows that humans are not purely self-interested. In addition, they strongly care about fairness. Therefore, multi-agent systems that fail to take fairness into account, may not be sufficiently aligned with human expectations and may not reach intended goals. In this paper, we present an overview of work in the area of fairness in multi-agent systems. More precisely, we first look at the classical agent model, that is, rational decision making. We then provide an outline of descriptive models of fairness, that is, models that explain how and why humans reach fair decisions. Then, we look at prescriptive, computational models for achieving fairness in adaptive multi-agent systems. We show that results obtained by these models are compatible with experimental and analytical results obtained in the field of behavioral economics. © 2008 Copyright Cambridge University Press 2008.",doi,10.1017/S026988890800132X,Scopus,Knowledge Engineering Review,"De Jong S., Tuyls K., Verbeeck K.",2008,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Feasibility Of Using Active Video Gaming As A Means For Increasing Energy Expenditure In Three Nonambulatory Young Adults With Disabilities,"Objective: To examine the feasibility of adapting active video games (AVGs) for nonambulatory wheelchair users at functionally diverse levels and to examine these AVGs as a method for increasing energy expenditure (EE) for 3 young adults with severe (SEV), moderate (MOD), and no upper extremity limitation (NL). Design: Case study. Setting: Residential special education school for youth and young adults with physical disabilities. Participants: Two young adults with spastic cerebral palsy (SEV, MOD) and one young adult with spina bifida (NL). All participants were nonambulatory wheelchair users. Methods: Each participant performed Wii bowling and tennis and an adapted upper extremity version of a Dance Dance Revolution (DDR) game pad. Main Outcome Measurements: EE was measured through indirect calorimetry (VO2). Heart rate data were collected with the use of a Polar Heart Rate Monitor. Results: SEV and MOD participants showed a higher percentage increase in EE for the Wii games (SEV, 25.6%; MOD, 30.8%) compared with DDR (SEV, 10.8%; MOD, 29.1%), whereas the participant with NL had a greater EE increase for the DDR (173.5%) compared with Wii (59.5%). Conclusions: AVGs showed clinically significant increases in EE for all 3 participants and can be performed by nonambulatory wheelchair users ranging from those with NL to those with SEV upper extremity limitation with the appropriate adaptations. © 2012 American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.",doi,10.1016/j.pmrj.2012.03.011,Scopus,PM and R,"Rowland J.L., Rimmer J.H.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali

,Forearm Blood Flow Responses Of Offspring Of Hypertensives To An Extended Stress Task,"The forearm blood flow and other cardiovascular responses of 10 healthy young men with a parental history of hypertension to an extended laboratory stressor were compared with the responses of 10 age-matched men with normotensive parents. To eliminate the effects of the anticipation of stress on baseline measures, all subjects participated in a separate 1-hour counterbalanced baseline session in which no stress was presented. There were no significant differences between the two groups in resting blood pressure, heart rate, blood volume pulse, forearm blood flow and vascular resistance, and self-report anxiety, although offspring of hypertensive parents exhibited marginally greater (p = 0.08) forearm blood flow at rest. During the stress session, subjects played video games for 1 hour and avoided mild electric shocks depending on performance. Offspring of hypertensive parents exhibited significantly greater heart rate (+19 ± 6 vs. +3 ± 2%), forearm blood flow (+52 ± 14 vs. +9 ± 4%), and self-report anxiety (+25 ± 6 vs. +9 ± 3%) response to the task. There were no signficant group differences in blood pressure response to the task. Significant positive correlations between forearm blood flow and heart rate responses to the task were observed. These findings extend earlier results that suggested healthy young offspring of hypertensive and normotensive parents may exhibit different patterns of hemodynamic response to stress in the absence of differences in resting blood pressure or blood pressure responsiveness to stress.",doi,10.1161/01.HYP.13.2.181,Scopus,Hypertension,"Ditto B., Miller S.B.",1989,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Formalizing Emergence: The Natural After-Life Of Artificial Life,"Originally, the field of Artificial Life was born out of the frustration and isolation felt by some ""hackers"" keen on cellular automata, game of life, genetic algorithms, L-systems and other computer recreations. Fascinated by this surprising cohabitation of programming simple algorithms and the complex working of these same algorithms (this new perception of complex phenomena as emerging from simple algorithms but iterated, distributed and recursive), convinced of the interest of their works for theoreticians of biology but aware of the lack of dialogue with them, they organized a series of workshops whose desired originality was multidisciplinarity and the coming together of researchers sharing the same will to understand the mechanisms and functions characterizing living organisms. These researchers in computer science, mathematics, physics, biology, robotics, philosophy, now meet every year, alternatively in Europe and the USA. What is discussed as inherent to all living organisms, and therefore which represents the bulk of the material dealt with during these workshops, are the mechanisms of self-organization or of the ""emerging functionalities"" opposing a centralized vision of biology, the need to better balance the coupling of the studied objects with their environment opposing a solipsistic methodology still representative of a certain artificial intelligence, the compulsory passage via the mechanisms of learning and adaptation as the most simple and autonomous way to face the complexity typical of the architecture and dynamics of these systems and, finally, the study of this complexity per se. A same motto brings together all these researchers: ""some form of complexity can be faced and domesticated very simply by relying on the computer brute force"". The mascots that are most representative of artificial life are: robotic insectoids, the game of life and other cellular automata, genetic algorithms, L-systems and simulations of ecosystems. These first workshops, due to the originality of the process, created a considerable stir. They undoubtedly seemed to reach their primary target, that is to allow better communication between researchers. Today, however, a certain breathlessness is noticeable which goes not without reminding the same dying down that characterized the cybernetic and systemic trends (Alife fathers) of the forties and fifties. The multidisciplinarity although essential to the inspiration does not survive, in principle, the specialization which arises naturally as a consequence of several years of study dedicated to a same subject and which drive researchers to privilege interlocutors sharing their same narrow and deep interest. Gradually new scientific communities appear with a more focused object of study and which, either free themselves of the mother field (like genetic algorithms or cellular automata) or become connected with existing communities (like robotics, study of ecosystems, study of the origin of life, study of insects societies). As we can notice during these workshops, ""life"" resists whatever unique and narrow definition. This diversity is the de-stabilizing factor which could cause the burst of artificial life. Besides, the risk is important of a forthcoming divorce, which has already taken place in artificial intelligence, between a so called ""strong"" science which could fuse with an existing scientific tradition (cognitive science for AI and theoretical biology for artificial life) and its so called ""weak"" counterpart with a more engineering like aftertaste and leading to technological innovations (expert systems, fuzzy logic and knowledge engineering in AI, neural networks, genetic algorithms and autonomous robotics in artificial life). If the artificial life star turns into a supernovae to finally explode and leaves behind, as relics of its glorious past, one and only one scientific pulsar, more focused, firmly grounded, and, above all, perpetrating as well as possible the original enthusiasm, the best candidate I can see could be a more formalized study of the emergent phenomena. My contribution to this characterization of emergent phenomena is currently limited to two of them appearing in a large amount of biological networks: the de-stabilizing effect of frustrated connectivity and the tendency to fragment the whole network into small clusters of units showing similar behavior. Among the networks showing these two emergent properties, the attention will be paid to only two of them: Hopfield Neural Networks (HNN) and Idiotypic Immune Networks (INN). Frustrated connectivity is responsible for perturbing the equilibrium dynamics of the network and provoking ""wavering"" among alternative equilibrium regimes. When frustrated a homeostatic network exhibits oscillatory behavior while an oscillatory network falls into a new type of chaotic regime which will be designated as frustrated chaos. In HNN, there is a threshold in the degree of connectivity which marks a sharp transition into the dynamics of the network. Below this threshold, i.e. in the case of a strongly diluted connectivity, the network clusters itself into small group of oscillatory units. In IIN also, this clustering phenomenon prevails and follows very regular rules for the dimension and the distribution of the clusters. It is clear that these two properties can be regarded as emergent since in order to appear they require a specific collective configuration of the units, and in order to be detected they require a level of observation which transcends each unit taken separately. In this paper, rather than theoretical analysis, results of computer simulation are given and briefly explained to illustrate these common properties.© 2006 Springer.

,Formative Assessment Can Be Fun As Well As Educational.,"An understanding of the hormonal basis of normal growth and development, including the changes occurring at puberty, is important foundation knowledge for contemporary medical practice in most fields of medicine. A quiz, testing the important physiological concepts of growth and puberty, was designed using the format of the well-known television game ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire."" An evaluation of this formative assessment activity revealed that a cohort of first-year undergraduate medical students valued learning with peers in an enjoyable, interactive environment, where they were able to admit to uncertainties and clarify answers. It also showed that making an educational activity fun need not detract from the focus of giving feedback on learning. Formative assessment, known to produce learning gains in a range of educational settings, is an important activity in contemporary medical education. With a greater emphasis on self-directed learning and less well-defined curriculum boundaries, feedback helps students to understand and apply the important physiological concepts that underpin the practice of medicine.",doi,10.1152/advan.00040.2005,pubmed,Advances in physiology education,"Hudson, J N; Bristow, D R",2006,NA,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,"Frequent Video-Game Playing In Young Males Is Associated With Central Adiposity And High-Sugar, Low-Fibre Dietary Consumption","Methods: A total of 45 young males (age range 18–27 years, BMI range 18.5–35.1 kg/m2) were recruited. Measurements of body composition and blood pressure were performed. The EPIC-FFQ questionnaire was used to assess dietary intake.

,From Medical Information And Education Texts Into Multimedia And Telematics,"Four home electric appliances have become essential in the every day lives of most people in industrialised countries: the video tape player-recorder, the compact disk player, the fax machine and the personal computer. The fax machine, which was the only device that involved connecting with remote parties, became as common as any of the other three mentioned before, and is now essential to modern life. More recently, the Personal Computer (PC) was introduced to home environments, becoming a new common domestic appliance. Whereas in the early times the 'PC to user' symbiosis was associated with the idea of isolation and autonomy, in present times, modems, telematics and the Internet, have broken down that isolation. However, telematics are not only tools for business or serious activities: its ""domestic"" sprouting was stimulated by children and teenagers (computer game and Nintendo generations). Their interest makes their parents be more aware of the practical uses of the 'PC via modem to Net' resources,... and not only for playing games and leisure activities. The Internet enjoys absolute freedom, therefore its contents are not regulated. The content may range from very interesting and useful information (for genuine users), down to contents judged to be intended for immoral, illegal or criminal purposes (users who are foreign to the spirit of the Net). Nevertheless, I personally defend the maintenance of a climate of absolute liberty as far as the Net or telematic networks are concerned. A philosophic principle of complete free communication structures, allows the development of the human mind, eliminating frontiers and integrating mankind. Let us recall that the main paradox of ARPANET, Internet's predecessor, developed for military applications, which transcended fundamental principles of the military environment: hierarchy, rank, power or position. On the Net, users are all equal, from the most humble student with a PC to the most powerful organisation, and this is the principle we must defend. Our efforts should be oriented towards generating useful contents that are permanently updated and improved by means of user-supplier communication. In view of cultural diversity, it is also important to fill the current gaps of information supply in Spanish or other languages different from English. © 1997 The authors.",doi,10.3233/978-1-60750-880-9-345,Scopus,Studies in Health Technology and Informatics,Caston O.L.,1997,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Gamygdala: An Emotion Engine For Games,"In this paper we present GAMYGDALA, an emotional appraisal engine that enables game developers to easily add emotions to their Non-Player Characters (NPC). Our approach proposes a solution that is positioned between event coding of affect, where individual events have predetermined annotated emotional consequences for NPCs, and a full blown cognitive appraisal model. Instead, for an NPC that needs emotions the game developer defines goals and annotates game events with a relation to these goals. Based on this input, GAMYGDALA produces an emotion for that NPC according to the well-known OCC model. In this paper we provide evidence for the following: GAMYGDALA provides black-box Game-AI independent emotion support, is efficient for large numbers of NPCs, and is psychologically grounded. © 2013 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/T-AFFC.2013.24,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing,"Popescu A., Broekens J., Van Someren M.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,"Gender-Specific Differences In Salivary Biomarker Responses To Acute Psychological Stress.

This study investigated gender differences in the activities of these two systems in response to acute psychological stress. Subjects were categorized according to their score in Spielberger's Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), which assesses the predisposition to personal anxiety. High (STAI score >or=55)- and low (STAI score <or=45)-anxiety groups were selected. A video of corneal surgery was served as the stressor for 15 min. Salivary cortisol and amylase levels were used as indices of the HPA and SAM activities, respectively. beta-endorphin was also assayed as a possible index of HPA activity. There were no differences in the resting salivary parameters among the groups. As expected, cortisol and amylase levels were significantly increased in all groups after the stressful video viewing. There were no gender differences in amylase levels in either the high- or low-anxiety groups. However, cortisol levels in highly anxious females were significantly lower than those in highly anxious males. Our findings show that highly anxious females exhibited lower cortisol release than highly anxious males, suggesting that high trait anxiety in females may be associated with an inability to respond with sufficient activation of HPA under acute psychological stress.",doi,10.1196/annals.1384.014,nagy2015,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,"Takai, N., Yamaguchi, M., Aragaki, T., Eto, K., Uchihashi, K., Nishikawa, Y.",2007,NA,NA,reviewer2,Ali

Though the authors of this article concur that unhealthy workplace stress must be managed, they hold the less widely held view that generating positive stress (eustress) within an organization is another important tool for management professionals. This article emphasizes specific methods that management professionals may employ to create healthy eustress in their organizations. The authors make the argument that workers who are properly challenged can achieve productive and adaptive levels of stress. This article begins by offering the reader a brief background describing eustress. Next, the authors present two separate theoretical models, the Challenge Hindrance Framework and the Holistic Stress Model, which provide unique explanations for the positive benefits of stress. The authors then offer a new managerial model for generating eustress in organizations. Finally, the potential benefits of eustress in the workplace, including employee savoring and flow are discussed.",doi,10.1016/j.orgdyn.2012.12.008,nagy2015,Organizational Dynamics,"Hargrove, M.

,"Genetic Influence On Blood Pressure Measured In The Office, Under Laboratory Stress And During Real Life","To determine to what extent the genetic influences on blood pressure (BP) measured in the office, under psychologically stressful conditions in the laboratory and during real life are different from each other. Office BP, BP during a video game challenge and a social stressor interview, and 24-h ambulatory BP were measured in 238 European American and 186 African American twins. BP values across the two tasks were averaged to represent stress levels. Genetic model fitting showed no ethnic or gender differences for any of the measures. The model fitting resulted in heritability estimates of 63, 75 and 71% for office, stress and 24-h systolic BP (SBP) and 59, 67 and 69% for diastolic BP (DBP), respectively. Up to 81% of the heritability of office SBP and 71% of office DBP were attributed to genes that also influenced stress BP. However, only 45% of the heritability of 24-h SBP and 49% of 24-h DBP were attributed to genes that also influence office BP. Similarly, about 39% of the heritability of 24-h SBP and 42% of 24-h DBP were attributed to genes that also influence stress BP. Substantial overlap exists between genes that influence BP measured in the office, under laboratory stress and during real life. However, significant genetic components specific to each BP measurement also exist. These findings suggest that partly different genes or sets of genes contribute to BP regulation in different conditions. © 2011 The Japanese Society of Hypertension All rights reserved.",doi,10.1038/hr.2010.218,Scopus,Hypertension Research,"Wang X., Ding X., Su S., Harshfield G., Treiber F., Snieder H.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Genetic Influence On Slope Variability In A Childhood Reflexive Attention Task,"Individuals are not perfectly consistent, and interindividual variability is a common feature in all varieties of human behavior. Some individuals respond more variably than others, however, and this difference may be important to understanding how the brain works. In this paper, we explore genetic contributions to response time (RT) slope variability on a reflexive attention task. We are interested in such variability because we believe it is an important part of the overall picture of attention that, if understood, has the potential to improve intervention for those with attentional deficits. Genetic association studies are valuable in discovering biological pathways of variability and several studies have found such associations with a sustained attention task. Here, we expand our knowledge to include a reflexive attention task. We ask whether specific candidate genes are associated with interindividual variability on a childhood reflexive attention task in 9-16 year olds. The genetic makers considered are on 11 genes: APOE, BDNF, CHRNA4, COMT, DRD4, HTR4, IGF2, MAOA, SLC5A7, SLC6A3, and SNAP25. We find significant associations with variability with markers on nine and we discuss the results in terms of neurotransmitters associated with each gene and the characteristics of the associated measures from the reflexive attention task. © 2015 Lundwall, Watkins.

,Glassy Dynamics And Aging In Disordered Systems,"A great number of disordered systems exhibit very long relaxation times as some critical temperature is approached. Below this temperature equilibrium is no longer reached within finite time and the behaviour of such systems becomes non ergodic. Among those are diluted alloys of magnetic ions in a non magnetic matrix, so called spin-glasses [1], supercooled liquids [2] entering some glassy state at low temperature or particles moving in a random potential exhibiting a transition from diffusion to creep or pinning [3, 4]. The temporal behaviour of such systems is often referred to as glassy dynamics. Below the characteristic temperature aging is observed [5]. If, for instance, a spin-glass is cooled in a magnetic field and kept for some waiting time, the complete decay of the magnetisation after the field has been switched off, is hindered for times of the order of the waiting time. Similar phenomena are observed for the deformation of glasses under the influence of applied forces. Glassy dynamics can also be of relevance for systems and phenomena outside physics. For some combinatorial optimisation problems simulated annealing is used in order to find good solutions. This means that some stochastic dynamics, characterized by some 'temperature', is used in order to find minima of a properly defined cost function. If such a system exhibits a freezing transition, it is not effective to spend much time in simulated annealing below this temperature and investigating the dynamics slightly above the freezing transition is much more efficient [6]. Other examples of systems of interest outside physics are models of neural networks or certain aspects of markets and other economical systems [7]. The systems mentioned above are classical. There is also interest in quantum mechanical disordered systems, for instance in certain spin-glasses or in interacting tunnelling systems being of relevance for glasses at very low temperatures. This lecture deals, however, with classical dynamical systems only.A breakthrough of our understanding of the low temperature properties of glassy systems came from replica theory and the replica symmetry breaking scheme proposed by Parisi [8]. This theory focuses on the evaluation of the free energy averaged over some frozen disorder. The picture emerging from this theory is a decomposition of phase space into so called pure states or ergodic components, separated by barriers of infinite hight in the thermodynamic limit. Investigating the overlap among those states, an ultrametric organization reveals. An alternative treatment of systems with quenched disorder is via dynamics [9, 10, 11, 12]. This will be the subject of this lecture. As it turns out there are many features and results common to both treatments, but there are also differences which will be discussed. In Sect. 2 I present some of the systems of interest, in particular spinglasses, supercooled liquids and glasses, drift, creep and pinning of a particle in a random potential, neural networks, graph partitioning as an example of combinatorial optimisation, the K-sat problem, a prototype problem from computer science, and finally the minority game as a model for the behaviour of agents on markets. Section 3 deals with the dynamics of the spherical p-spin-glass with long ranged interactions. This model is a prototype for glassy dynamics. The equations of motion for correlation- and response-functions are derived and equilibrium solutions above the freezing temperature are investigated. Below the freezing temperature the system behaves for short time as if it were in equilibrium, for longer time its off equilibrium nature becomes apparent and correlation- and response-functions depend on waiting time. This is the manifestation of aging. At the end of Sect. 3 I discuss the so called crossover region and aging in glasses. Within mode coupling theory, which is discussed in the contribution of R. Schilling [13] in this volume, and which shows great similarity to the p-spin model, a dynamical transition is found at some critical temperature Tc. This is sometimes referred to as 'ideal glass transition'. Comparison with experiments shows that this transition is actually smeared out and the fitted Tc is well above the actual glass transition region. Some smearing out also results from an extended version of the mode coupling theory, which applies, however, to equilibrium only. I am going to discus a modified version of the p-spin model, which is able to take account for this rounding as well as aging. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.",doi,10.1007/3-540-26869-3_10,Scopus,Collective Dynamics of Nonlinear and Disordered Systems,Horner H.,2005,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Heart Rate And Match Analysis In Pre-Pubescent Soccer Players,"The aim of this study was to compare match analysis (using video recordings) and the physiological load (heart rate measured every 5 s, blood lactate measured after the warm-up, first half and second half) of six 11-year-old soccer players during official games of eleven-a-side on a regular-sized pitch (100 × 65 m) and of seven-a-side on a small pitch (60 × 40 m). In both games, heart rate exceeded 170 beats.min-1 84% of the time, while blood lactate and ranged from 1.4 to 8.1 mmol.l-1. No significant differences were recorded for the physiological parameters. For both matches, walking comprised 38% of total time, running 55%, inactivity 3% and jumping 3%. Although there were no significant differences between halves or matches, running for less than 10 s was 10% more frequent in the seven-a-side game. In the seven-a-side game, there were significantly more passes and significantly fewer tackles, suggesting that seven-a-side matches played on smaller pitches may be more suitable for pre-pubescent soccer players.",doi,10.1080/026404101300149339,Scopus,Journal of Sports Sciences,"Capranica L., Tessitore A., Guidetti L., Figura F.",2001,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Heart Rate Responses And Technical-Tactical Aspects Of Official 5-A-Side Youth Soccer Matches Played On Clay And Artificial Turf,"Using a randomized crossover design, this study aimed to compare the heart rate (HR) responses and match analysis parameters (i.e., type of action; the number of players involved in an action; the number of passes performed in a collective action; precision of the shots; lost balls; ball interceptions; dribblings; and tackles) of official 5-a-side youth male soccer matches played over 2 pitch surface (i.e., clay vs. artificial turf) conditions. Twenty-two young male soccer players (age 8.3 6 0.4 years) engaged in 2 consecutive 15-minute periods in each experimental condition. During the match, 53% of HR responses exceeded 85% of the individual HR peak. No difference emerged between both pitch surfaces and match periods for HR and match analysis indicators. The two 15-minute periods resulted in being appropriate for 8-year-old players, in resembling the intensity of play and the intermittent nature of adult soccer. The similar HR responses and technical-tactical patterns observed on the 2 surfaces indicate that youth match play is not affected by differences in pitch surface. To support the development of individual and team skills of young soccer players, coaches are advised to prioritize game knowledge based on divergent thinking and experience, rather than traditional teaching based on instructions. © 2012 National Strength and Conditioning Association.",doi,10.1519/JSC.0b013e31821854f2,Scopus,Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research,"Tessitore A., Perroni F., Meeusen R., Cortis C., Lupo C., Capranica L.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,"High And Low Emotion Events Influence Emotional Stress Perceptions And Are Associated With Salivary Cortisol Response Changes In A Consecutive Stress Paradigm. Psychoneuroendocrinology, 27(3), 337–352.","Numerous studies over the last few decades have successfully utilized ""psychological"" stressors to examine stress-induced cortisol release as a function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) cascade. In contrast, research examining the effect emotionally-laden stressors may have on cortisol release is scarce. Moreover, the results from the few studies that have examined subjective perceptions of emotional stress and their relationship to cortisol release are mixed. Thus, little is known about the impact an emotionally-charged stressor may have on cortisol responsivity and even less is understood about the relationship between cortisol release and perceived emotional stress. The primary goal of the present research was to investigate the effect of consecutive, emotionally stressful events on cortisol release. The secondary goal was to examine the influence perceptions about emotionally stressful events might have on cortisol responsivity. This is the first study to identify two distinct patterns of cortisol release that were significantly reversed (P=0.006) in response to high and low emotion events presented in a consecutive stress paradigm that were associated with perceptions of emotional stress.",doi,10.1016/S0306-4530(01)00055-5,nagy2015,Psychoneuroendocrinology,"Nejtek, V.

,Honest Vs Cheating Bots In Patrol-Based Real-Time Strategy Mmogs,"Massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs) are being increasingly successful, since they allow players to explore huge virtual worlds and to interact in many different ways, either cooperating or competing. To support the implementation of ultra-scalable real-time strategy MMOGs, we are developing a middleware, called PATROL, that is based on a structured peer-to-peer overlay scheme. Among other features, PATROL provides AI-based modules to detect cheating attempts, that the decentralized communication infrastructure may favor. In this work we illustrate how we implemented honest and cheating autonomous players (bots). In particular, we show how honest bots can detect cheating bots in real-time, using strategies based on neural networks. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.",doi,10.1007/978-3-642-37577-4_15,Scopus,"Evolution, Complexity and Artificial Life","Sebastio S., Amoretti M., Murga J.R., Picone M., Cagnoni S.",2014,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Hostile And Hardened? An Experimental Study On (De-)Sensitization To Violence And Suffering Through Playing Video Games,"This study tests whether playing violent video games leads to desensitization and increased cardiovascular responding. In a laboratory experiment, 42 men spent 20 min playing either a high- or low-violence version of a ""first-person shooter"" game. Arousal (heart rate, respiration rate) was measured continuously. After, playing the game, emotional responses to aversive and aggressive stimuli - pictures from Lang, Bradley, and Cuthbert's (1999) International Affective Picture System - were assessed with self-ratings and physiological measurement (skin conductance). Results showed no differences in the judgments of emotional responses to the stimuli. However, different effects of game violence emerged in the physiological reactions to the different types of stimulus material. Participants in the high-violence condition showed significantly weaker reactions (desensitization) to aversive stimuli and reacted significantly more strongly (sensitization) to aggressive cues. No support was found for the arousal hypothesis. Post-hoc analyses are used to discuss possible moderating influences of gaming experience and player's trait aggressiveness in terms of the General Aggression Model (Anderson & Bushman, 2001) and the Downward Spiral Model (Slater, Henry, Swaim, & Anderson, 2003). © 2008 by Verlag Hans Huber.",doi,10.1024/1421-0185.67.1.41,Scopus,Swiss Journal of Psychology,"Staude-Müller F., Bliesener T., Luthman S.",2008,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Hot Under The Collar: The Impact Of Heat On Game Play,"High temperatures have been documented to affect behavior in a variety of ways depending on the nature of the task. We extended this prior research by examining the effects of dynamically changing temperature on various aspects of performance in a video game task. In the span of approximately an hour, temperature was gradually increased, stayed constant for a period of time, and gradually decreased to baseline. The gaming task was a variation on one used to assess impulsivity in participants thus allowing the possibility of assessing the effects of temperature on impulsive choice. Rather than heat increasing impulsivity and thus decreasing wait times, participants showed increases in wait times as temperature increased which either suggests that participants were becoming more self-controlled under heat or that the documented negative impact of heat on motor functioning was dominating their performance. Importantly, the participant's sensitivity to the changing task requirements was not affected by changes in temperature. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",doi,10.1016/j.apergo.2016.08.035,Scopus,Applied Ergonomics,"Young M.E., McCoy A.W., Hutson J.P., Schlabach M., Eckels S.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,How Do Engineering Attitudes Vary By Gender And Motivation? Attractiveness Of Outreach Science Exhibitions In Four Countries,"Outreach activities, like mobile science exhibitions, give opportunities to hands-on experiences in an attractive learning environment. We analysed attitudes, motivation and learning during a science exhibition visit, their relations to gender and future educational plans in Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Belgium (N = 1210 sixth-graders). Pupils' performance in a knowledge test improved after the visit. Autonomous motivation and attitudes towards science predicted situation motivation awakened in the science exhibition. Interestingly, the scientist attitude and the societal attitude were clearly separate dimensions. The third dimension was manifested in the engineering attitude typical for boys, who were keener on working with appliances, designing computer games and animations. Scientist and societal attitudes correlated positively and engineering attitude correlated negatively with the future educational plans of choosing the academic track in secondary education. The societal perspective on science was connected to above average achievement. In the follow-up test, these attitudes showed to be quite stable. © 2016 SEFI.",doi,10.1080/03043797.2015.1121466,Scopus,European Journal of Engineering Education,"Salmi H., Thuneberg H., Vainikainen M.-P.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,How Effective Are Antioxidant Supplements In Obesity And Diabetes?,"Obesity is a central health issue due to its epidemic prevalence and its association with type 2 diabetes and other comorbidities. Obesity is not just being overweight. It is a metabolic disorder due to the accumulation of excess dietary calories into visceral fat and the release of high concentrations of free fatty acids into various organs. It represents a state of chronic oxidative stress and low-grade inflammation whose intermediary molecules may include leptin, adiponectin and cytokines. It may progress to hyperglycemia, leading to type 2 diabetes. Whether or not dietary antioxidant supplements are useful in the management of obesity and type 2 diabetes is discussed in this review. Only the benefits for obesity and diabetes are examined here. Other health benefits of antioxidants are not considered. There are difficulties in comparing studies in this field because they differ in the time frame, participants' ethnicity, administration of antioxidant supplements, and even in how obesity was measured. However, the literature presents reasonable evidence for marginal benefits of supplementation with zinc, lipoic acid, carnitine, cinnamon, green tea, and possibly vitamin C plus E, although the evidence is much weaker for omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, coenzyme Q10, green coffee, resveratrol, or lycopene. Overall, antioxidant supplements are not a panacea to compensate for a fast-food and video-game way of living, but antioxidant-rich foods are recommended as part of the lifestyle. Such antioxidant foods are commonly available. © 2015 S.

,Humor Engineering In Smart Environments,"Enjoyment is one of the positive emotions we expect to have when visiting environments that have been designed to provide us with entertainment experiences. However, enjoyment is also part of our daily life, whether we are at home, in our office environment, in public environments, or on the move from one environment to the other. Humor is important in our daily experiences. We ourselves and our daily conversational partners are expected to have a sense of humor. We cannot maintain friendly relationships with family members, friends, and colleagues without having this sense of humor. Humor is one of the most appreciated traits in human-human interaction. In this chapter, we investigate the possible role of humor in smart environments or, from an opposite perspective, how smart digital technology, its sensors, and actuators can help to introduce humorous situations and interactions in digitally enhanced physical worlds. With these words in mind, we discuss accidental, spontaneous, scripted, and staged humor. We will also draw upon humor as it appears nowadays in artificial physical environments, such as video game environments. Conclusions will be drawn about being able to include humorous interactions and about being able to participate in humorous activities in smart technology-supported environments and events. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",doi,10.1007/978-3-319-29433-9_3,Scopus,Emotional Engineering Volume 4,Nijholt A.,2016,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Imaging Monetary Reward In Pathological Gamblers,"We acquired two 18F-deoxyglucose positron emisssion tomography (PET) scans on seven unmedicated pathological gamblers, at least 7 days apart. Following an injection of 5 mCi FDG, subjects carried out a computer blackjack task for 35 min under two different reward conditions: monetary reward and computer game points only. Relative FDG metabolic rate was obtained from regions of interest in the prefrontal cortex, cingulate, striatum and visual cortex. Monetary reward blackjack was associated with significantly higher relative metabolic rate in the primary visual cortex (Brodmann area 17), the cingulate gryus (Brodmann area 24), the putamen and prefrontal areas 47 and 10, compared to blackjack playing for points only. No area tested showed a significant decrease. This pattern suggests heightened limbic and sensory activation in the gambling for money condition with increased emotional valence and greater risk and reward, and confirms the salience of monetary reward in the development of pathological gambling. © 2005 Taylor &amp; Francis.",doi,10.1080/15622970510029768,Scopus,World Journal of Biological Psychiatry,"Hollander E., Pallanti S., Baldini Rossi N., Sood E., Baker B.R., Buchsbaum M.S.",2005,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,"Impact Of A Nurse-Directed, Coordinated School Health Program To Enhance Physical Activity Behaviors And Reduce Body Mass Index Among Minority Children: A Parallel-Group, Randomized Control Trial","Background: Underserved children, particularly girls and those in urban communities, do not meet the recommended physical activity guidelines (&gt;60. min of daily physical activity), and this behavior can lead to obesity. The school years are known to be a critical period in the life course for shaping attitudes and behaviors. Children look to schools for much of their access to physical activity. Thus, through the provision of appropriate physical activity programs, schools have the power to influence apt physical activity choices, especially for underserved children where disparities in obesity-related outcomes exist. Objectives: To evaluate the impact of a nurse directed, coordinated, culturally sensitive, school-based, family-centered lifestyle program on activity behaviors and body mass index. Design, settings and participants: This was a parallel group, randomized controlled trial utilizing a community-based participatory research approach, through a partnership with a University and 5 community schools. Participants included 251 children ages 8-12 from elementary schools in urban, low-income neighborhoods in Los Angeles, USA. Methods: The intervention included Kids N Fitness©, a 6-week program which met weekly to provide 45min of structured physical activity and a 45min nutrition education class for parents and children. Intervention sites also participated in school-wide wellness activities, including health and counseling services, staff professional development in health promotion, parental education newsletters, and wellness policies for the provision of healthy foods at the school. The Child and Adolescent Trial for Cardiovascular Health School Physical Activity and Nutrition Student Questionnaire measured physical activity behavior, including: daily physical activity, participation in team sports, attending physical education class, and TV viewing/computer game playing. Anthropometric measures included height, weight, body mass index, resting blood pressure, and waist circumference. Measures were collected at baseline, completion of the intervention phase (4 months), and 12 months post-intervention. Results: Significant results for students in the intervention, included for boys decreases in TV viewing; and girls increases in daily physical activity, physical education class attendance, and decreases in body mass index z-scores from baseline to the 12 month follow-up. Conclusions: Our study shows the value of utilizing nurses to implement a culturally sensitive, coordinated, intervention to decrease disparities in activity and TV viewing among underserved girls and boys. © 2012.",doi,10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2012.09.004,Scopus,International Journal of Nursing Studies,"Wright K., Giger J.N., Norris K., Suro Z.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Implications Of Plasma Levels Of Catechols In The Evaluation Of Sympathoadrenomeduuary Function,"This report summarizes new techniques for examining aspects of sympathoadrenomedullary function. Tracer pharmacokinetic methods are more accurate than measurements of antecubital venous norepinephrine (NE) in assessing sympathoneural responsiveness. During mental challenge (playing a video game), patients with essential hypertension had significantly larger increments of NE spillover into arterial blood than did normotensive control subjects, whereas responses of antecubital venous and even arterial NE did not differ significantly between the groups. The rate of neuronal reuptake of endogenous NE can be measured in vivo using plasma levels of NE and of the intraneuronal NE metabolite, dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG). Regional production of dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) may reflect catecholamine biosynthesis, and DOPA may be an indirectly acting natriuretic neurohormone. Positron emission tomography after injection of positron-emitting fluorodopamine may allow in vivo, noninvasive assessments of regional sympathetic function.

,Increased Neural Responses To Unfairness In A Loss Context,"Unfairness plays an important role in economic decision making. This fMRI study sought to investigate how the loss and the gain contexts could modulate behavioral and brain responses to unfairness by focusing on participants' rejection behaviors during an Ultimatum Game paradigm. Participants were scanned while they were playing the Ultimatum Game as responders in both loss and gain contexts, i.e. receiving ¥50 as gains and paying for ¥50 as losses. At the behavioral level, lower fairness ratings and higher rejection rates were revealed for unfair losses than unfair gains. At the neural level, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, bilateral anterior insula, anterior cingulate cortex/anterior middle cingulate cortex and bilateral dorsal striatum were associated with rejection (vs. acceptance) in the loss context, but not in the gain context. Together, our data indicated that participants may experience more unfairness in UG and stronger desire to sanction social norm violations in the loss context than in the gain context, inducing more fairness-related neutral activities when rejecting (vs. accepting) unfair losses than unfair gains. These findings shed light on the significance of context (i.e. loss or gain) in fairness-related social decision-making processes. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",doi,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.03.048,Scopus,NeuroImage,"Guo X., Zheng L., Zhu L., Li J., Wang Q., Dienes Z., Yang Z.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Inexpensive Spatial Position System For The Automation Of Inspection With Mobile Robots,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop a wireless positioning system. The automation of non-destructive testing (NDT) of large and complex geometry structures such as aircraft wings and fuselage is prohibitively expensive, though automation promises to improve on manual ultrasound testing. One inexpensive way to achieve automation is by using a small wall-climbing mobile robot to move a single ultrasound probe over the surface through a scanning trajectory defined by a qualified procedure. However, the problem is to guide the robot though the trajectory and know whether it has followed it accurately to confirm that the qualified procedure has been carried out.Design/methodology/approach - The approach is to use sophisticated bulk electronics developed for game playing in combination with MATLAB to develop a wireless positioning system.Findings - The paper describes the development of an inexpensive wireless system comprising an optical spatial positioning system and inertial measurement unit that relates the 3D location of an NDT probe carried by a mobile robot to a computer-aided drawing (CAD) representation of the test structure in a MATLAB environment. The probe is located to an accuracy of - 2 mm at distances of 5 m.Research limitations/implications - Positioning range is limited to 5 m. Further development is required to increase this range.Practical implications - The wireless system is used to develop tools to guide the robot remotely to follow a desired scanning trajectory, obtain feedback about the actual trajectory executed by the robot, know exactly where an ultrasound pulse echo was captured, map identified defects on the CAD and relate them to the real test object.Originality/value - An inexpensive spatial positioning system with sufficient accuracy for automated NDT purposes. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",doi,10.1108/IR-09-2014-0386,Scopus,Industrial Robot,"Al Rashed M.A., Sattar T.P.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Influence Of Negative Affect On Choice Behavior In Individuals With Binge Eating Pathology,"Research suggests that individuals with binge eating pathology (e.g., bulimia nervosa (BN) and binge eating disorders (BED)) have decision making impairments and particularly act impulsively in response to negative affect. The aim of this study was to examine the influence of negative affect on choice behavior in women with BN and BED. Ninety women (59 with BN or BED and 31 healthy controls) watched a sad or control film fragment and were subsequently asked to complete a choice behavior task (as measured by a variation of the Bechara Gambling Task (BGT)). Results showed that negative affect influenced choice behavior differently in healthy controls and in women with BN and BED after punishment (but not after reward). In the context of increased negative affect, punishment was associated with more disadvantageous choice behavior in both BN and BED women but not in healthy controls, while the effect was the exact opposite in both groups after a decrease in negative affect. Levels of sadness were not found to influence choice behavior after reward in either groups. These findings suggest that emotional states may have a direct impact on choice behavior of individuals with binge eating pathology and are not only related to pathological behavior itself. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.psychres.2012.10.016,Scopus,Psychiatry Research,"Danner U.N., Evers C., Sternheim L., Van Meer F., Van Elburg A.A., Geerets T.A.M., Breteler L.M.T., T.D. de Ridder D.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Influencing Trust For Human-Automation Collaborative Scheduling Of Multiple Unmanned Vehicles,"Objective: We examined the impact of priming on operator trust and system performance when supervising a decentralized network of heterogeneous unmanned vehicles (UVs). Background: Advances in autonomy have enabled a future vision of single-operator control of multiple heterogeneous UVs. Real-time scheduling for multiple UVs in uncertain environments requires the computational ability of optimization algorithms combined with the judgment and adaptability of human supervisors. Because of system and environmental uncertainty, appropriate operator trust will be instrumental to maintain high system performance and prevent cognitive overload. Method: Three groups of operators experienced different levels of trust priming prior to conducting simulated missions in an existing, multiple-UV simulation environment. Results: Participants who play computer and video games frequently were found to have a higher propensity to overtrust automation. By priming gamers to lower their initial trust to a more appropriate level, system performance was improved by 10% as compared to gamers who were primed to have higher trust in the automation. Conclusion: Priming was successful at adjusting the operator's initial and dynamic trust in the automated scheduling algorithm, which had a substantial impact on system performance. Application: These results have important implications for personnel selection and training for futuristic multi-UV systems under human supervision. Although gamers may bring valuable skills, they may also be potentially prone to automation bias. Priming during training and regular priming throughout missions may be one potential method for overcoming this propensity to overtrust automation. © Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.",doi,10.1177/0018720815587803,Scopus,Human Factors,"Clare A.S., Cummings M.L., Repenning N.P.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Interaction Between Emotional State And Learning Underlies Mood Instability,"Intuitively, good and bad outcomes affect our emotional state, but whether the emotional state feeds back onto the perception of outcomes remains unknown. Here, we use behaviour and functional neuroimaging of human participants to investigate this bidirectional interaction, by comparing the evaluation of slot machines played before and after an emotion-impacting wheel-of-fortune draw. Results indicate that self-reported mood instability is associated with a positive-feedback effect of emotional state on the perception of outcomes. We then use theoretical simulations to demonstrate that such positive feedback would result in mood destabilization.

,Interference Competition And High Temperatures Reduce The Virulence Of Fig Wasps And Stabilize A Fig-Wasp Mutualism,"Fig trees are pollinated by fig wasps, which also oviposit in female flowers. The wasp larvae gall and eat developing seeds. Although fig trees benefit from allowing wasps to oviposit, because the wasp offspring disperse pollen, figs must prevent wasps from ovipositing in all flowers, or seed production would cease, and the mutualism would go extinct. In Ficus racemosa, we find that syconia ('figs') that have few foundresses (ovipositing wasps) are underexploited in the summer (few seeds, few galls, many empty ovules) and are overexploited in the winter (few seeds, many galls, few empty ovules). Conversely, syconia with many foundresses produce intermediate numbers of galls and seeds, regardless of season. We use experiments to explain these patterns, and thus, to explain how this mutualism is maintained. In the hot summer, wasps suffer short lifespans and therefore fail to oviposit in many flowers. In contrast, cooler temperatures in the winter permit longer wasp lifespans, which in turn allows most flowers to be exploited by the wasps. However, even in winter, only in syconia that happen to have few foundresses are most flowers turned into galls. In syconia with higher numbers of foundresses, interference competition reduces foundress lifespans, which reduces the proportion of flowers that are galled. We further show that syconia encourage the entry of multiple foundresses by delaying ostiole closure. Taken together, these factors allow fig trees to reduce galling in the wasp-benign winter and boost galling (and pollination) in the wasp-stressing summer. Interference competition has been shown to reduce virulence in pathogenic bacteria. Our results show that interference also maintains cooperation in a classic, cooperative symbiosis, thus linking theories of virulence and mutualism. More generally, our results reveal how frequency-dependent population regulation can occur in the fig-wasp mutualism, and how a host species can 'set the rules of the game' to ensure mutualistic behavior in its symbionts. © 2009 Wang et al.",doi,10.1371/journal.pone.0007802,Scopus,PLoS ONE,"Wang R.-W., Ridley J., Sun B.-F., Zheng Q., Dunn D.W., Cook J., Shi L., Zhang Y.-P., Yu D.W.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Introduction: Self-Action Models,"This chapter defines a general framework of self-action models, in which the self-repair network is considered. Motivations for the self-action models will be discussed by correspondence between information-intensive artificial systems (information systems involving connected computers) and biological systems. With increasing similarity between these two systems, emphasis is placed on a game theoretic approach for selfish agents and evolutionary mechanism for the autonomy and maintenance of information-intensive artificial systems. The background is also explained, introducing related paradigms of autonomic computing, recovery oriented computing and grid computing. Other related fields such as game theory (with evolutionary and spatial game theory), network sciences (with the graph theory and statistics), interacting particle systems (based on probabilistic process theory) and reliability theory are also briefly explained. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",doi,10.1007/978-3-319-26447-9_1,Scopus,Intelligent Systems Reference Library,[No author name available],2015,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,"Is It A Sense Of Autonomy, Control, Or Attachment? Exploring The Effects Of In-Game Customization On Game Enjoyment","This study presents a model linking character customization and game enjoyment. Two separate studies using different types of customization (functional vs. aesthetic) were employed to test two competing mechanisms that explain the effects of customizing in-game characters: feelings of autonomy and control - rooted in self-determination theory - and perceived attachment to game characters. Additionally, this study investigated how these two divergent mechanisms influence game enjoyment through immersion-related experiences. The findings showed that the feelings of autonomy and control are consistently stronger explanations for enjoyment, regardless of customization type. The results suggest that similar to other entertainment media, games can appeal to individuals through the senses of autonomy, control, and attachment to a character; the first two prove more critical. ©2015 Elsevier Ltd.

,Is Sensation Seeking A Correlate Of Excessive Behaviors And Behavioral Addictions? A Detailed Examination Of Patients With Gambling Disorder And Internet Addiction,"Sensation Seeking has repeatedly been related to substance use. Also, its role as a correlate of Gambling Disorder has been discussed although research has led to heterogeneous results. Likewise, first studies on Internet Addiction have indicated increased Sensation Seeking, to some extent contradicting clinical impression of patients suffering from internet addiction. We assessed Sensation Seeking in a clinical sample of n=251 patients with Gambling Disorder, n=243 patients with internet addiction, n=103 clients with excessive but not addictive internet use, and n=142 healthy controls. The clinical groups were further sub-divided according to the preferred type of addictive behavior (slot-machine gambling vs. high arousal gambling activities and internet gaming disorder vs. other internet-related addictive behaviors). Decreased scores in some subscales of Sensation Seeking were found among male patients compared to healthy controls with no differences between patients with Gambling Disorder and Internet Addiction. The type of preferred gambling or online activity was not related to differences in Sensation Seeking. Previous findings indicating only small associations between Sensation Seeking and Gambling Disorder were confirmed. Regarding Internet Addiction our results contradict findings from non-clinical samples. Sensation Seeking might be relevant in initiating contact to the health care system. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.psychres.2016.06.004,Scopus,Psychiatry Research,"Müller K.W., Dreier M., Beutel M.E., Wölfling K.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Just Watching The Game Ain't Enough: Striatal Fmri Reward Responses To Successes And Failures In A Video Game During Active And Vicarious Playing,"Although the multimodal stimulation provided by modern audiovisual video games is pleasing by itself, the rewarding nature of video game playing depends critically also on the players' active engagement in the gameplay. The extent to which active engagement influences dopaminergic brain reward circuit responses remains unsettled. Here we show that striatal reward circuit responses elicited by successes (wins) and failures (losses) in a video game are stronger during active than vicarious gameplay. Eleven healthy males both played a competitive first-person tank shooter game (active playing) and watched a pre-recorded gameplay video (vicarious playing) while their hemodynamic brain activation was measured with 3-tesla functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Wins and losses were paired with symmetrical monetary rewards and punishments during active and vicarious playing so that the external reward context remained identical during both conditions. Brain activation was stronger in the orbitomedial prefrontal cortex (omPFC) during winning than losing, both during active and vicarious playing conditions. In contrast, both wins and losses suppressed activations in the midbrain and striatum during active playing; however, the striatal suppression, particularly in the anterior putamen, was more pronounced during loss than win events. Sensorimotor confounds related to joystick movements did not account for the results. Self-ratings indicated losing to be more unpleasant during active than vicarious playing. Our findings demonstrate striatum to be selectively sensitive to self-acquired rewards, in contrast to frontal components of the reward circuit that process both self-acquired and passively received rewards. We propose that the striatal responses to repeated acquisition of rewards that are contingent on game related successes contribute to the motivational pull of video-game playing. © 2013 Kätsyri, Hari, Ravaja and Nummenmaa.",doi,10.3389/fnhum.2013.00278,Scopus,Frontiers in Human Neuroscience,"Katsyri J., Hari R., Ravaja N., Nummenmaa L.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,"Knowing, Communicating, And Experiencing Through Body And Emotion","With new technologies such as body sensors, tangible interaction, haptics, interactive cloth, or small computing devices such as mobiles, we can move interaction from the desktop out into the world and onto our bodies. Likewise, with the boom of computer games, domestic digital technology use, and social communication tools, we have to consider designing for noninstrumental goals, beyond task completion. This has been picked up by human-computer interaction researchers in the so-called third wave of HCI, a movement that aims to design for experiences involving users emotionally, bodily, and providing for aesthetic experiences. We suggest that learning technologies could pick up on some of the results from the third wave of HCI, placing body and emotion more centrally into the communication and construction of knowledge. Designing for bodily interaction, emotional communication, or aesthetics is not trivial. In design work, a designer can only set the stage for certain experiences to happen, but in the end, it is the user who coconstructs the experience with or through the interaction. Based on our experiences of designing for bodily and emotional communication with others and with yourself, we will posit three postulates that might be helpful in designing for involving interaction: leaving 'surfaces' open for users to appropriate, building for users to recognize themselves socially, emotional or bodily through the interface, and avoiding reductionism. We also briefly discuss how bodily experiences may be of relevance to learning technologies. © 2008 IEEE",doi,10.1109/TLT.2009.3,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies,Höök K.,2008,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Lacunar Stroke In A Hypertensive Football Player: Implications In Managing Hypertension In Athletes,"Purpose: A 28-year-old hypertensive professional football player suffered a lacunar stroke. Given the rarity of stroke at this young age, the contributory roles of hypertension and competitive athletics merit consideration. Case summary: A 28-year-old defensive lineman, with long-standing, albeit recently well-controlled hypertension, experienced slurred speech and veering to his right after a game. Computerized tomography revealed a small internal capsule infarct. Diagnostic investigation, including coagulation profiling, sickle screen, antiphospholipid antibody, carotid imaging, and echocardiography did not reveal a cause. The patient recovered within days with no residual impairment. Discussion: Despite the extreme blood pressure elevation associated with isometric straining in young athletes, stroke almost never occurs. Vascular changes resulting from chronic hypertension and/or marked volume depletion, and hemoconcentration resulting from restricted salt intake, diuretic use, and heavy sweating, offer the only explanations for this stroke. Relevance: The case suggests physicians should exercise caution in using diuretics and salt-restricted diets to treat hypertensive athletes.

,Laif: A Logging And Interaction Framework For Gaze-Based Interfaces In Virtual Entertainment Environments,"Eye tracking is starting to be used for evaluation and interaction in virtual environments. Especially digital games can benefit from an integrated approach, using eye tracking technology for analysis and interaction. One benefit is faster development of gaze interaction games, which can be automatically evaluated in iterative development cycles. For this purpose, we present a framework of programming libraries that enables rapid game development and gameplay analysis within an experimental research environment. The framework presented here is extensible for different kinds of logging (e.g., psychophysiological and in-game behavioral data) and facilitates studies using eye-tracking technology in digital entertainment environments. An experimental study using gaze-only interaction in a digital game is presented and highlights the framework's capacity to create games and evaluate novel entertainment interfaces. © 2010 International Federation for Information Processing.",doi,10.1016/j.entcom.2010.09.004,Scopus,Entertainment Computing,"Nacke L.E., Stellmach S., Sasse D., Niesenhaus J., Dachselt R.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali

This is the youngest of the 10 reported patients with this laptop-induced dermatosis since its first description in 2004. Erythema ab igne is a reticular, pigmented, sometimes telangiectatic dermatosis that is caused by prolonged exposure to a heat or infrared source. In laptop-induced erythema ab igne, the localization on the thighs and asymmetry are characteristic. The heat originates from the optical drive, the battery, or the ventilation fan of the computer.

,Layering And Heterogeneity As Design Principles For Animated Embedded Agents,Animation of three-dimensional digital characters is still a major hurdle in the production of films and video games. This paper analyzes the technology of autonomous embedded agents as a solution to this challenge. Multi-layering and heterogeneity are chosen as desirable principles for the design of digital characters. The FreeWill+ animation framework has been developed with these principles in mind. Its general structure as well as some of its special features are presented. Automatic action acquisition based on the Q-learning technique has been presented as an extended example of the system capabilities. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

,Learning In Groups Of Traffic Signals,"Computer science in general, and artificial intelligence and multiagent systems in particular, are part of an effort to build intelligent transportation systems. An efficient use of the existing infrastructure relates closely to multiagent systems as many problems in traffic management and control are inherently distributed. In particular, traffic signal controllers located at intersections can be seen as autonomous agents. However, challenging issues are involved in this kind of modeling: the number of agents is high; in general agents must be highly adaptive; they must react to changes in the environment at individual level while also causing an unpredictable collective pattern, as they act in a highly coupled environment. Therefore, traffic signal control poses many challenges for standard techniques from multiagent systems such as learning. Despite the progress in multiagent reinforcement learning via formalisms based on stochastic games, these cannot cope with a high number of agents due to the combinatorial explosion in the number of joint actions. One possible way to reduce the complexity of the problem is to have agents organized in groups of limited size so that the number of joint actions is reduced. These groups are then coordinated by another agent, a tutor or supervisor. Thus, this paper investigates the task of multiagent reinforcement learning for control of traffic signals in two situations: agents act individually (individual learners) and agents can be ""tutored"", meaning that another agent with a broader sight will recommend a joint action. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

,Learning Non-Cooperative Game For Load Balancing Under Self-Interested Distributed Environment,"Resources in large-scale distributed systems are distributed among several autonomous domains. These domains collaborate to produce significantly higher processing capacity through load balancing. However, resources in the same domain tend to be cooperative, whereas those in different domains are self-interested. Fairness is the key to collaboration under a self-interested environment. Accordingly, a fairness-aware load balancing algorithm is proposed. The load balancing problem is defined as a game. The Nash equilibrium solution for this problem minimizes the expected response time, while maintaining fairness. Furthermore, reinforcement learning is used to search for the Nash equilibrium. Compared with static approaches, this algorithm does not require a prior knowledge of job arrival and execution, and can adapt dynamically to these processes. The synthesized tests indicate that our algorithm is close to the optimal scheme in terms of overall expected response time under different system utilization, heterogeneity, and system size; it also ensures fairness similar to the proportional scheme. Trace simulation is conducted using the job workload log of the Scalable POWERpallel2 system in the San Diego Supercomputer Center. Our algorithm increases the expected response time by a maximum of 14%. But it improves fairness by 12–27% in contrast to Opportunistic Load Balancing, Minimum Execution Time, Minimum Completion Time, Switching Algorithm, and k-Percent Best. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",doi,10.1016/j.asoc.2016.10.028,Scopus,Applied Soft Computing Journal,"Xiao Z., Tong Z., Li K., Li K.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,"Longitudinal Relationship Of Parental Hypertension With Body Mass Index, Blood Pressure, And Cardiovascular Reactivity In Children","Objective: To investigate whether parental hypertension (HTN) affects children's body mass index (BMI) and cardiovascular reactivity (CVR) over time. Study design: A longitudinal study of 315 students (black: 23 females, 19 males; white: 142 females, 131 males) was conducted in the public schools of Obion County, Tennessee, between 1987 and 1992. BMI and BMI z scores were calculated. The CVR task was a series of video games (taking ∼10 minutes to play) given to the same students in their third-, fourth-, fifth-, seventh-, and eighth-grade years. CVR was defined as the change in blood pressure (Δ_BP) or heart rate (Δ_HR) between before playing and while playing the video game. Positive parental history of HTN (27.6%) was defined as at least 1 parent with HTN. Multivariable regression analyses were performed to estimate the effects of parental HTN on children's BMI and CVR over time. Results: Children with parental HTN had significant higher BMI, BMI z score, and R_BP than did children without parental HTN (BMI: 21.6 vs 19.9, P = .001; BMI z score: 1.6 vs 1.1, P = .003; R_SBP: 112.6 vs 110.4 mm Hg, P = .01; R_DBP 62.7 vs 60.6 mm Hg, P = .003) after adjustment for covariates. Increased CVR was observed in children with parental HTN compared with children without parental HTN but was statistically significant only for SBP (Δ_SBP: 17.2 vs 14.9 mm Hg; P = .01) after adjustment for covariates. Conclusions: Parental HTN independently predicted children's BMI, BMI z score, resting BP, and BP reactivity. © 2007 Mosby, Inc.

,Losses Disguised As Wins In Modern Multi-Line Video Slot Machines,"Aims: Players can wager on multiple lines of modern slot machines. When they spin and fail to gain any credits, the machine goes into a state of relative quiet. By contrast, when they spin and win, these spins are accompanied by reinforcing sights and sounds. Such reinforcement also occurs when the amount won is less than the spin wager. We sought to show that these 'losses disguised as wins', or LDWs, would be as arousing as wins, and more arousing than regular losses. Measurement and participants: We measured skin conductance response (SCR) amplitudes and heart-rate changes following wins, LDWs and losses for 40 novices playing a multi-line slot machine. Findings: SCR amplitudes were similar for wins and LDWs - both were significantly larger than for regular losses. Conclusions: For novice players, the reinforcing sights and sounds of the slot machine triggered arousal on wins, where the number of credits gained was greater than the spin wager, but also on 'losses disguised as wins' where the amount 'won' was less than the spin wager. Despite the fact that players lost money on these spins, these outcomes were more arousing than regular losses where no credits were gained. Although these findings involve novice players, the heightened arousal associated with these losses may have implications for the development of problem gambling, as arousal has been viewed as a key reinforcer in gambling behaviour. © 2010 Society for the Study of Addiction.",doi,10.1111/j.1360-0443.2010.03050.x,Scopus,Addiction,"Dixon M.J., Harrigan K.A., Sandhu R., Collins K., Fugelsang J.A.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Lower Cardiorespiratory Fitness Is Associated With More Time Spent Sedentary In First Episode Psychosis: A Pilot Study,"Patients with a psychotic disorder show lower cardiorespiratory fitness and higher mortality rates compared to healthy individuals. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to explore whether in patients with first-episode psychosis a low cardiorespiratory fitness is associated with decreased physical activity and increased sedentary levels. Twenty-nine outpatients (21 men; 22.8±5.1 years) performed a maximal exercise test to assess their maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max), wore a Senswear armband for five consecutive days and were assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Twenty-four patients (82.8%) scored below the normative cardiorespiratory values. The percent-predicted VO2max ranged from 47% to 109%. In a backward regression analysis, less time spent sedentary (min/day) was the only independent predictor of a higher VO2max. The model explained 28.0% of the variance in the VO2max-score. The current study indicates that future research should explore whether reducing sedentary behaviour (e.g. time spent napping or prolonged sitting during waking hours) might improve cardio-respiratory fitness levels. Interventions targeting recreational screen time (watching television, computer use, playing video games, etc.) or replacing passive to more active video games should be investigated. © 2017 Elsevier Ireland Ltd",doi,10.1016/j.psychres.2017.03.027,Scopus,Psychiatry Research,"Vancampfort D., De Hert M., Myin-Germeys I., van Winkel R., Firth J., Van Damme T., Probst M.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Lusting While Loathing: Parallel Counterdriving Of Wanting And Liking,"We show how being ""jilted""-that is, being thwarted from obtaining a desired outcome-can concurrently increase desire to obtain the outcome, but reduce its actual attractiveness. Thus, people can come to both want something more and like it less. Two experiments illustrate such disjunctions following jilting experiences. In Experiment 1, participants who failed to win a prize were willing to pay more for it than those who won it, but were also more likely to trade it away when they ultimately obtained it. In Experiment 2, failure to obtain an expected reward led to increased choice, but also negatively biased evaluation, of an item that was merely similar to that reward. Such disjunctions were exhibited particularly by individuals low in intensity of felt affect, a finding supporting an emotional basis for relative harmonization of wanting and liking. These results demonstrate how dissociable psychological subsystems for wanting and liking can be driven in opposing directions. © The Author(s) 2010.",doi,10.1177/0956797609355633,Scopus,Psychological Science,"Litt A., Khan U., Shiv B.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Machinima's Promise,"The author investigates machinima's incapacity to achieve full emancipation from the video game sphere to become a mature, autonomous, and independent form of expression; one possible explanation behind this conundrum is that the machinima community generally perceives itself as consisting of filmmakers - as in live action filmmaking - rather than animators. Thus, the stylistic, narrative and production methods used in both traditional and computer-generated animated stories are ignored or overlooked. For machinima to become more diverse, both visually and narratively, its production tools have to untie themselves from the computer games that they originated from, while embracing the unique approach and ease of use of real-time animation. © The Author(s), 2011.",doi,10.1177/1470412910391550,Scopus,Journal of Visual Culture,Kirschner F.,2011,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Major Depressive Disorder Is Characterized By Greater Reward Network Activation To Monetary Than Pleasant Image Rewards,"Anhedonia, the loss of interest or pleasure in normally rewarding activities, is a hallmark feature of unipolar Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). A growing body of literature has identified frontostriatal dysfunction during reward anticipation and outcomes in MDD. However, no study to date has directly compared responses to different types of rewards such as pleasant images and monetary rewards in MDD. To investigate the neural responses to monetary and pleasant image rewards in MDD, a modified Monetary Incentive Delay task was used during functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess neural responses during anticipation and receipt of monetary and pleasant image rewards. Participants included nine adults with MDD and 13 affectively healthy controls. The MDD group showed lower activation than controls when anticipating monetary rewards in right orbitofrontal cortex and subcallosal cortex, and when anticipating pleasant image rewards in paracingulate and supplementary motor cortex. The MDD group had relatively greater activation in right putamen when anticipating monetary versus pleasant image rewards, relative to the control group. Results suggest reduced reward network activation in MDD when anticipating rewards, as well as relatively greater hypoactivation to pleasant image than monetary rewards. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.pscychresns.2011.06.012,Scopus,Psychiatry Research - Neuroimaging,"Smoski M.J., Rittenberg A., Dichter G.S.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Maladaptive Cognitions Predict Changes In Problematic Gaming In Highly-Engaged Adults: A 12-Month Longitudinal Study,"Understanding the role of maladaptive gaming-related cognitions may assist in screening and interventions for problematic gaming, including Internet gaming disorder (IGD). Cognitive-behavioural interventions that target specific cognitions related to gaming may be more effective than more general approaches that focus only on preoccupation with games. Although past research has identified cross-sectional associations between maladaptive cognitions and problematic gaming, it is less clear whether these cognitions can predict future changes in problematic gaming behaviour. The present study employed an 18-item measure of gaming cognition, assessing perfectionism, cognitive salience, regret, and behavioural salience, to investigate potential changes in problematic gaming over a 12-month period. The sample included 465 Australian adults (84% male, Mage = 26.2 years). It was found that individuals who became problematic gamers over 12 months had higher baseline scores on perfectionism (d = 1.20), cognitive salience (d = 0.74) and regret (d = 0.69) than those who remained non-problematic gamers. Problematic gamers who became non-problematic gamers had lower baseline perfectionism scores (d = 0.62) than those who remained problematic gamers. Cognitive change accounted for an additional 28% of variance in problematic gaming scores beyond gender, age, and frequency of gaming. These findings suggest that maladaptive gaming-related cognitions could be screened in clinical trials to aid in case formulation and inform decisions on needed interventions to deliver optimal client outcomes. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",doi,10.1016/j.addbeh.2016.10.013,Scopus,Addictive Behaviors,"Forrest C.J., King D.L., Delfabbro P.H.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Match Demands Of Professional Futsal: A Case Study,"Despite its popularity and competitive status there have been only few scientific studies that have examined Futsal in professional players. Consequently the aim of this study was to examine the physiological responses and activity pattern to Futsal simulated game-play in professional players. Eight full-time professional outfield Futsal players volunteered for this study: age 22.4 (95% CI 18.8-25.3) years, body mass 75.4 (60-91) kg, height 1.77 (1.59-1.95) m and VO2max 64.8 (53.8-75.8) ml kg-1 min-1. Physiological measurements were assessed during highly competitive training games (4 × 10-min quarters) and consisted of game VO2, game blood-lactate concentration ([la]b) and game heart rates (HRs). Game activities were assessed using a computerised video-analysis system. During simulated game-play players attained 75% (59-92) and 90% (84-96) of VO2max and HRmax, respectively. Mean game VO2 was 48.6 (40.1-57.1) ml kg-1 min-1. Peak game VO2 and HRs were 99% (88-109) and 98% [90-106] of laboratory maximal values, respectively. Players spent 46 and 52% of the playing time at exercise intensities higher than 80 and 90% of VO2max and HRmax, respectively. Mean [la]b was 5.3 (1.1-10.4) mmol l-1. Players covered 121 (105-137) m min-1 and 5% (1-11) and 12% (3.8-19.5) of playing time spent performing sprinting and high-intensity running, respectively. On average players performed a sprint every ∼79 s during play.

,Maximizing The Impact Of Emotive Antitobacco Advertising: Effects Of Interpersonal Discussion And Program Placement,"Recent research suggests antitobacco advertising that elicits strong emotional arousal may be effective in prompting cessation. We examined response to a new graphic emotive advertisement about the smoking-related disease emphysema. We aimed to investigate the influence of the ad-induced interpersonal communication and the effect of television program viewing context. In a preexposure interview daily smokers (n = 205) were asked to watch a particular television program they usually watched. Post-exposure interviews examining recall and responses were conducted within two days of exposure. Over a quarter (26%) discussed the ad and these participants were more likely to be motivated to quit. Those who saw the television ad within a comedy program were less likely to believe the ad, whereas those who saw it during a reality TV=game show were more likely to discuss the ad and be motivated to quit smoking. These findings indicate that discussion of the ad with family and friends is associated with intentions to quit, our results also suggest there might be some value in placing graphic emotional ads within reality television or game show programs and in avoiding comedy programs.",doi,10.1080/15245000600851334,Scopus,Social Marketing Quarterly,"Durkin S., Wakefield M.",2006,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Media Violence And The Self: The Impact Of Personalized Gaming Characters In Aggressive Video Games On Aggressive Behavior,"A recent development in video games is that players can design and personalize their own in-game characters. It was predicted that this innovation could lead to elevations in the intensity of the psychological effects of video games. The present study confirmed this hypothesis, revealing that participants who played an aggressive video game using their own, personalized character exhibited higher levels of aggressive behavior than participants who played an aggressive game with a non-personalized character. The aggressive behavior levels of the own-character players also exceeded those of individuals who played a non-aggressive game, regardless of whether or not they used a personalized character. Process analyses revealed that participants playing a violent video game with a personalized game character experienced more arousal and self-activation than they did when playing with an impersonal, default game character, which in turn increased aggressive responses. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

,Mental Hoop Diaries: Emotional Memories Of A College Basketball Game In Rival Fans,"The rivalry between the men's basketball teams of Duke University and the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill (UNC) is one of the most storied traditions in college sports. A subculture of students at each university form social bonds with fellow fans, develop expertise in college basketball rules, team statistics, and individual players, and self-identify as a member of a fan group. The present study capitalized on the high personal investment of these fans and the strong affective tenor of a Duke-UNC basketball game to examine the neural correlates of emotional memory retrieval for a complex sporting event. Male fans watched a competitive, archived game in a social setting. During a subsequent functional magnetic resonance imaging session, participants viewed video clips depicting individual plays of the game that ended with the ball being released toward the basket. For each play, participants recalled whether or not the shot went into the basket. Hemodynamic signal changes time locked to correct memory decisions were analyzed as a function of emotional intensity and valence, according to the fan's perspective. Results showed intensity-modulated retrieval activity in midline cortical structures, sensorimotor cortex, the striatum, and the medial temporal lobe, including the amygdala. Positively valent memories specifically recruited processing in dorsal frontoparietal regions, and additional activity in the insula and medial temporal lobe for positively valent shots recalled with high confidence. This novel paradigm reveals how brain regions implicated in emotion, memory retrieval, visuomotor imagery, and social cognition contribute to the recollection of specific plays in the mind of a sports fan.

,Meta-Learning For Realizing Self-X Management Of Future Networks,"In this paper, we propose an autonomic network management and policy execution framework. The proposed framework refactors the network functionalities by decomposing the network architecture into hierarchical layered architecture. This paper aims at enabling the transition from a rule-based control structure to a more distributed and autonomic network control by implementing the self-x or self-∗ learning vision on each layer. The problem is modeled using multi-layer dynamic games. At each layer, a self-∗ learning procedure is proposed to learn and adapt the reverse Stackelberg policies. To validate the proposed framework, we develop a full scale demonstrator comprising of flat IP core and heterogeneous wireless access networks. We have also developed various tools and software agents to implement the self-x management vision. The proposed self-x learning is implemented via mobile intelligent agents in a distributed fashion. Our experimental results show quick re-stabilization of the self-∗ learning in mobile intelligent agents and the observed performance remain well above the satisfactory values for different key performance indicator with the proposed meta-learning approach. © 2013 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2745999,Scopus,IEEE Access,"Khan M.A., Tembine H.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Metabolic Responses Of Upper-Body Accelerometer-Controlled Video Games In Adults,"Historically, video games required little physical exertion, but new systems utilize handheld accelerometers that require upper-body movement. It is not fully understood if the metabolic workload while playing these games is sufficient to replace routine physical activity. The purpose of this study was to quantify metabolic workloads and estimate caloric expenditure while playing upper-body accelerometer-controlled and classic seated video games. Nineteen adults completed a peak oxygen consumption treadmill test followed by an experimental session where exercising metabolism and ventilation were measured while playing 3 video games: control (CON), low activity (LOW) and high activity (HI). Resting metabolic measures (REST) were also acquired. Caloric expenditure was estimated using the Weir equation. Mean oxygen consumption normalized to body weight for HI condition was greater than LOW, CON, and REST. Mean oxygen consumption normalized to body weight for LOW condition was also greater than CON and REST. Mean exercise intensities of oxygen consumption reserve for HI, LOW, and CON were 25.8% ± 5.1%, 6.4% ± 4.8%, and 0.8% ± 2.4%, respectively. Estimated caloric expenditure during the HI was significantly related to aerobic fitness, but not during other conditions. An active video game significantly elevated oxygen consumption and heart rate, but the increase was dependent on the type of game. The mean oxygen consumption reserve during the HI video game was below recommended international standards for moderate and vigorous activity. Although upper-body accelerometer-controlled video games provided a greater exercising stimulus than classic seated video games, these data suggest they should not replace routine moderate or vigorous exercise.",doi,10.1139/H10-058,Scopus,"Applied Physiology, Nutrition and Metabolism","Stroud L.C., Amonette W.E., Dupler T.L.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Metacognition Of Agency: Proximal Action And Distal Outcome,"The cues contributing to people's metacognitions of agency were investigated in two experiments in which people played a computer game that involved trying to ""touch"", via a mouse moving a cursor, downward scrolling X's (Experiment 1), or trying to ""explode"" the downward scrolling X's (Experiment 2). Both experiments varied (a) proximal action-related information by either introducing or not introducing Turbulence into the mouse controls and (b) distal outcome-related information such that touched X's ""exploded"" either 100 or 75 % of the time. Both variables affected people's judgments of agency (JOAs), but the effect was different. First, the decrement in feelings of agency was greater with the proximal variable than with distal variable. Second, while the proximal variable always had a large direct effect on JOAs, even taking judgments of performance (JOPs) into account, JOPs completely accounted for the effect of the distal variable in Experiment 1, where the instructions were just to touch the X's. And even in Experiment 2, in which the instructions were to explode the X's, the direct effect of the distal variable on JOAs was small. These data indicate that these two cues exhibit different psychological profiles. The proximal action-related information is a diagnostic cue to agency indicating the match between one's own intentions and actions. Internal monitoring of intentions is necessary and so the self is implicated. However, distal outcome can be largely monitored using information external to the agent, and so-while it is used by people to make agency judgments-it is a non-diagnostic cue. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.",doi,10.1007/s00221-012-3371-6,Scopus,Experimental Brain Research,"Metcalfe J., Eich T.S., Miele D.B.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Militainment And Mechatronics: Occultatio And The Veil Of Science Fiction Cool In United States Air Force Advertisements,"In 2009, the United States Air Force aired a series of science fiction-themed recruitment commercials on network television and their official YouTube channel. In these advertisements, the superimposition of science fiction imagery over depictions of Air Force operations frames these missions as near-future sci-fi adventure, ironically summarized by the tagline: ""It's not science fiction. It's what we do every day."" Focusing on an early advertisement for the Air Force's Reaper unmanned aerial vehicle, this essay explores how themes essential to the science fiction genre play a role in influencing contemporary attitudes about autonomous and semi-autonomous robotic weapons, as well as the way in which the aesthetic and functional qualities of these advanced technologies are used to frame moral arguments about their use. As a reconfiguration of the near-future battleground in the guise of science fiction, the ""Reaper"" ad reveals the way in which science fiction has come to serve as a functional-aesthetic benchmark and cultural sounding board, against which ""every day"" technologies can be measured and claims about their value, ethos, and social appeal are made. This essay explores the ethical entanglements between science fiction film and video games, and military technology, and the complex role science fiction plays in influencing public attitudes towards military technologies. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",doi,10.1007/s10676-013-9316-3,Scopus,Ethics and Information Technology,Maradin III N.R.,2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Mind-Operated Devices: Mental Control Of A Computer Using Biofeedback,"This study investigated whether people could learn to control a computer using a biofeedback interface that integrated their galvanic skin response (GSR), heart rate, and temperature. Twenty participants played a computer game using the biofeedback device, both individually and in pairs. Results indicated that most people learned to control the game after a single training session. The GSR measure was the most sensitive means of control. Pairs of participants controlled the device more effectively than single individuals did. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",doi,10.1089/cpb.2006.9.1,Scopus,Cyberpsychology and Behavior,"Parente A., Parente R.",2006,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Model Forecast Improvements With Decreased Horizontal Grid Spacing Over Finescale Intermountain Orography During The 2002 Olympic Winter Games,"Forecasts produced for the 2002 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games (23 January-25 March 2002) by a multiply nested version of the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University-National Center for Atmospheric Research (PSU-NCAR) Mesoscale Model (MM5) are examined to determine if decreasing horizontal grid spacing to 4 km improves forecast accuracy over the finescale topography of the Intermountain West. The verification is based on high-density observations collected by the Meso West cooperative networks, including approximately 200 wind and temperature sites and 100 precipitation sites across northern Utah. Wind and precipitation forecasts produced by the 4-km MM5 domain were m ore accurate (based on traditional measures) than those of its parent 12-km domain. The most significant improvements in wind speed forecasts occurred at night in valleys and lowland locations where the topography of the 4-km domain produced more accurate nocturnal flows. Wind direction forecast improvements were most substantial at mountain sites where the better topographic resolution of the 4-km domain more accurately reflected the exposure of these locations to the free atmosphere. The 4-km domain also produced quantitative precipitation forecasts that were either equally (small events) or more (large events) accurate than the 12-km domain. Precipitation bias errors varied substantially between the two domains since the representation of the region's narrow, steeply sloped, basin-and-range topography improved dramatically at 4-kM grid spacing. Curiously, the overall accuracy of t emperature forecasts by the 4-km domain was not significantly better than that of the 12-km domain. This was due to an inability of the MM5 to properly simulate nocturnal and persistent cold pools within mountain valleys and the lowlands upstream of the Wasatch Mountains. Paradoxically, the added resolution of the 4-km domain, coupled with the failure of this version of the MM5 to fully capture the nocturnal and persistent cold pools, resulted in poorer skill scores. At upper elevations, which are typically above the cold pools, the 4-km domain was substantially more accurate. These results illustrate that decreasing horizontal grid spacing to less than 10 km does improve wind and precipitation forecasts over finescale Intermountain West topography. It is hypothesized that model improvements will ultimately enable the advantages of added model resolution to be fully realized for temperature forecasts over the Intermountain West. © 2005 American Meteorological Society.",doi,10.1175/WAF865.1,Scopus,Weather and Forecasting,"Hart K.A., Steenburgh W.J., Onton D.J.",2005,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,More Than Just A Game: Ethical Issues In Gamification,"Gamification is the use of elements and techniques from video game design in non-game contexts. Amid the rapid growth of this practice, normative questions have been under-explored. The primary goal of this article is to develop a normatively sophisticated and descriptively rich account for appropriately addressing major ethical considerations associated with gamification. The framework suggests that practitioners and designers should be precautious about, primarily, but not limited to, whether or not their use of gamification practices: (1) takes unfair advantage of workers (e.g., exploitation); (2) infringes any involved workers’ or customers’ autonomy (e.g., manipulation); (3) intentionally or unintentionally harms workers and other involved parties; or (4) has a negative effect on the moral character of involved parties. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",doi,10.1007/s10676-016-9401-5,Scopus,Ethics and Information Technology,"Kim T.W., Werbach K.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Mortal Kombat: The Effects Of Violent Video Game Play On Males’ Hostility And Cardiovascular Responding.,"We examined cardiovascular (CV) reactivity and hostility among 30 male undergraduates after either nonviolent (billiards) or 1 of 2 levels of violent videogame play. Violence varied among 2 versions of the game Mortal Kombat (MK1 = less violent, MK2 = more violent)—all other factors (graphics, sound) were held equal. As expected, increased game violence elicited greater CV reactivity and higher scores on hostility measures. Subjects who played MK1 or MK2 had higher heart rate reactivity than those who played billiards. Subjects who played MK2 showed greater systolic blood pressure reactivity than those who played MK1 or billiards. Finally, subjects who played MK2 scored higher on the hostility measures than those who played MK1, who in turn scored higher than those who played billiards. These results indicate that the level of videogame violence, not just violence per se, should be of concern to consumers.",doi,10.1111/j.1559-1816.1996.tb02740.x,anderson2010,Journal of Applied Social Psychology,"Ballard, M.

,"Motivation, Sustained Attention, And Autonomic Regulation In School-Age Boys Exposed In Utero To Opiates And Alcohol","The effects of incentive on sustained attention and autonomic regulation among boys exposed in utero to opiates were studied. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), an indicator of autonomic regulation, was quantified during sustained attention in 3 groups of 7- to 12-year-old boys. RSA is a component of heart rate variability controlled by cortical influences and affected by changes in demand for attention. The Gordon Diagnostic System-Distractibility Task was performed with and without monetary reward. A cartoon task and a video game were used as measures of interest. Although opiate-exposed boys did not differ in performance as a function of incentive or interest, they had a tendency to perform more poorly overall across tasks. Alcohol exposure rather than opiate exposure covaried with autonomic regulation, with greater RSA decreases being associated with more alcohol exposure. Post hoc analyses revealed that the alcohol- and opiate-exposed boys responded with these hyperreactive RSA changes along with poorer performance.",doi,10.1037/1064-1297.5.4.375,Scopus,Experimental and Clinical Psychopharmacology,"Suess P.E., Newlin D.B., Porges S.W.",1997,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Movement-Based Sports Video Games: Investigating Motivation And Gaming Experience,"Video game consoles that enable gamers to use active body movements are becoming increasingly popular. Yet, little is known about the influence of movement on how gamers experience such games. This study takes an exploratory approach, using different data collection methods. A theory about the relationship between body movement and gaming experience emerges through the systematic collection and analysis of data obtained from interviews, questionnaires, video observations and a motion capture system. A Grounded Theory analysis of the interviews reveals two distinct motivations (to achieve and to relax) with which gamers approach such games, together with two corresponding movement control strategies. Four movement-specific items are found to influence immersion in movement-based interaction: natural control, mimicry of movements, proprioceptive feedback, and physical challenge. These results are verified by exploiting the movement patterns of gamers playing the Nintendo Wii Boxing game. This theory offers insights to game designers as to how to design future generations of movement-based games. Whilst a controller that leaves more space for appropriation can be appealing to a larger population, its design may fail to promote and motivate physical activity and emotional well-being. © 2009.",doi,10.1016/j.entcom.2009.09.004,Scopus,Entertainment Computing,"Pasch M., Bianchi-Berthouze N., van Dijk B., Nijholt A.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Multi-Robot Coalition Formation,"As the community strives towards autonomous multi-robot systems, there is a need for these systems to autonomously form coalitions to complete assigned missions. Numerous coalition formation algorithms have been proposed in the software agent literature. Algorithms exist that form agent coalitions in both super additive and non-super additive environments. The algorithmic techniques vary from negotiation-based protocols in multi-agent system (MAS) environments to those based on computation in distributed problem solving (DPS) environments. Coalition formation behaviors have also been discussed in relation to game theory. Despite the plethora of MAS coalition formation literature, to the best of our knowledge none of the proposed algorithms have been demonstrated with an actual multi-robot system. There exists a discrepancy between the multi-agent algorithms and their applicability to the multi-robot domain. This paper aims to bridge that discrepancy by unearthing the issues that arise while attempting to tailor these algorithms to the multi-robot domain. A well-known multi-agent coalition formation algorithm has been studied in order to identify the necessary modifications to facilitate its application to the multi-robot domain. This paper reports multi-robot coalition formation results based upon simulation and actual robot experiments.

,Negative Feelings Exacerbate Hostile Attributions Of Intent In Highly Aggressive Boys,"Tested the hypothesis that aggressive boys' tendency to attribute hostile intentions to peers is exacerbated in a negative emotional state. Twenty-nine highly aggressive boys in special education, 12 moderately aggressive boys in regular education, and 16 nonaggressive boys in regular education inferred peers' intentions in 8 vignettes concerning ambiguous provocation by peers. Mild negative emotions were induced by unjust loss of a manipulated computer game. Half the vignettes were completed in this negative emotional state. After completion of all vignettes, the game was played again and won to reinduce positive feelings. Self-ratings of feelings obtained throughout the study showed the manipulations consecutively induced negative and positive feelings. Negative feelings increased hostile attribution of intent in the highly aggressive group. Highly and moderately aggressive boys responded more aggressively than nonaggressive boys.",doi,10.1207/15374420360533068,Scopus,Journal of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology,"Orobio de Castro B., Slot N.W., Bosch J.D., Koops W., Veerman J.W.",2003,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Neural Contributions To Flow Experience During Video Game Playing,"Video games are an exciting part of new media. Although game play has been intensively studied, the underlying neurobiology is still poorly understood. Flow theory is a well-established model developed to describe subjective game experience. In 13 healthy male subjects, we acquired fMRI data during free play of a video game and analyzed brain activity based on the game content. In accordance with flow theory, we extracted the following factors from the game content: (i) balance between ability and challenge; (ii) concentration and focus; (iii) direct feedback of action results; (iv) clear goals; and (v) control over the situation/activity. We suggest that flow is characterized by specific neural activation patterns and that the latter can be assessed-at least partially-by content factors contributing to the emergence of flow. Each of the content factors was characterized by specific and distinguishable brain activation patterns, encompassing reward-related midbrain structures, as well as cognitive and sensorimotor networks. The activation of sensory and motor networks in the conjunction analyses underpinned the central role of simulation for flow experience. Flow factors can be validated with functional brain imaging which can improve the understanding of human emotions and motivational processes during media entertainment. © The Author (2011).",doi,10.1093/scan/nsr021,Scopus,Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience,"Klasen M., Weber R., Kircher T.T.J., Mathiak K.A., Mathiak K.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,"Neural Signatures Of Economic Parameters During Decision-Making: A Functional Mri (Fmri), Electroencephalography (Eeg) And Autonomic Monitoring Study","Adaptive behaviour requires an ability to obtain rewards by choosing between different risky options. Financial gambles can be used to study effective decisionmaking experimentally, and to distinguish processes involved in choice option evaluation from outcome feedback and other contextual factors. Here, we used a paradigm where participants evaluated 'mixed' gambles, each presenting a potential gain and a potential loss and an associated variable outcome probability. We recorded neural responses using autonomic monitoring, electroencephalography (EEG) and functional neuroimaging (fMRI), and used a univariate, parametric design to test for correlations with the eleven economic parameters that varied across gambles, including expected value (EV) and amount magnitude. Consistent with behavioural economic theory, participants were risk-averse. Gamble evaluation generated detectable autonomic responses, but only weak correlations with outcome uncertainty were found, suggesting that peripheral autonomic feedback does not play a major role in this task. Long-latency stimulus-evoked EEG potentials were sensitive to expected gain and expected value, while alpha-band power reflected expected loss and amount magnitude, suggesting parallel representations of distinct economic qualities in cortical activation and central arousal. Neural correlates of expected value representation were localized using fMRI to ventromedial prefrontal cortex, while the processing of other economic parameters was associated with distinct patterns across lateral prefrontal, cingulate, insula and occipital cortices including default-mode network and early visual areas. These multimodal data provide complementary evidence for distributed substrates of choice evaluation across multiple, predominantly cortical, brain systems wherein distinct regions are preferentially attuned to specific economic features. Our findings extend biologically-plausible models of risky decision-making while providing potential biomarkers of economic representations that can be applied to the study of deficits in motivational behaviour in neurological and psychiatric patients. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",doi,10.1007/s10548-011-0210-1,Scopus,Brain Topography,"Minati L., Grisoli M., Franceschetti S., Epifani F., Granvillano A., Medford N., Harrison N.A., Piacentini S., Critchley H.D.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Neural Substrates And Social Consequences Of Interpersonal Gratitude: Intention Matters,"Voluntary help during a time of need fosters interpersonal gratitude, which has positive social and personal consequences such as improved social relationships, increased reciprocity, and decreased distress. In a behavioral and a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment, participants played a multiround interactive game where they received pain stimulation. An anonymous partner interacted with the participants and either intentionally or unintentionally (i.e., determined by a computer program) bore part of the participants' pain. In each round, participants either evaluated their perceived pain intensity (behavioral experiment) or transferred an amount of money to the partner (fMRI experiment). Intentional (relative to unintentional) help led to lower experience of pain, higher reciprocity (money allocation), and increased interpersonal closeness toward the partner. fMRI revealed that for the most grateful condition (i.e., intentional help), value-related structures such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) showed the highest activation in response to the partner's decision, whereas the primary sensory area and the anterior insula exhibited the lowest activation at the pain delivery stage. Moreover, the vmPFC activation was predictive of the individual differences in reciprocal behavior, and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) activation was predictive of self-reported gratitude. Furthermore, using multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), we showed that the neural activation pattern in the septum/hypothalamus, an area associated with affiliative affect and social bonding, and value-related structures specifically and sensitively dissociated intentional help from unintentional help conditions. These findings contribute to our understanding of the psychological and neural substrates of the experience of interpersonal gratitude and the social consequences of this emotion. © 2016 American Psychological Association.",doi,10.1037/emo0000258,Scopus,Emotion,"Yu H., Cai Q., Shen B., Gao X., Zhou X.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali

Design/methodology/approach: The experimental group (n=903) completed the following activities about one week apart from each other: pretest, played the game, posttest, and follow-up test. The control group (n=365) completed the same activities at similar intervals but did not have access to the game until after the follow-up test. Findings: Linear mixed-effects models, controlling for gender, grade, and geographic location revealed significant time by group effects for knowledge of safe cooking temperatures for animal proteins and danger zone hazard prevention, and usual produce washing behaviors. Pairwise comparisons, adjusted for multiple comparisons, indicated that after playing the game, the experimental group felt more susceptible to foodborne illness, had stronger attitudes toward the importance of handling food safely and handwashing, had greater confidence in their ability to practice safe food handling, and had greater intentions to practice handwashing and safe food handling. Teachers and students found the game highly acceptable.

,"Nintendo Wii Sports And Wii Fit Game Analysis, Validation, And Application To Stroke Rehabilitation","Background: Interactive video gaming has become ubiquitous in the practice of rehabilitation. The Nintendo Wii is one such system. Interactive gaming can promote intensive task-based therapy in a manner that is motivating for the user. Widespread enthusiasm for consoles and their games prompted us to analyze the games for their rehabilitation elements related to improving balance and mobility for individuals poststroke. Purpose: The purpose of this article is to provide a game analysis for clinical application and evaluation of the game elements for research on interactive video gaming. Methods: Using a team of game players and raters, 5 tables (1 for the Wii Sports and 4 for the Wii Fit) were developed and validated. The tables consist of 3 categories: game description, impairments targeted (strength, endurance, balance, and coordination), and feedback provided (knowledge of performance [KP] and knowledge of results [KR]). Two domain content experts established face validity. Construct validity was performed by 2 therapist-raters who had more than 15 years' clinical experience and postgraduate training in motor learning. Observations about the games including the fidelity of the interfaces, the nature of the feedback, and some of the challenges to adapting the games for rehabilitation are presented. Results: An 80% agreement between raters set as the criterion for establishing the construct validity was met for feedback evaluation. There was 100% agreement on impairment ratings. Games provide a greater amount of KR compared with KP. Conclusion: Given the preponderance of KR, therapists will need to monitor motor performance. Adaptation of interactive video consoles for rehabilitation requires careful evaluation of the games' attributes using relevant rehabilitation construits. © 2011 Thomas Land Publishers, Inc.",doi,10.1310/tsr1806-701,Scopus,Topics in Stroke Rehabilitation,"Deutsch J.E., Brettler A., Smith C., Welsh J., John R., Guarrera-Bowlby P., Kafri M.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,No Effect Of Ambient Odor On The Affective Appraisal Of A Desktop Virtual Environment With Signs Of Disorder,"Background: Desktop virtual environments (VEs) are increasingly deployed to study the effects of environmental qualities and interventions on human behavior and safety related concerns in built environments. For these applications it is essential that users appraise the affective qualities of the VE similar to those of its real world counterpart. Previous studies have shown that factors like simulated lighting, sound and dynamic elements all contribute to the affective appraisal of a desktop VE. Since ambient odor is known to affect the affective appraisal of real environments, and has been shown to increase the sense of presence in immersive VEs, it may also be an effective tool to tune the affective appraisal of desktop VEs. This study investigated if exposure to ambient odor can modulate the affective appraisal of a desktop VE with signs of public disorder. Method: Participants explored a desktop VE representing a suburban neighborhood with signs of public disorder (neglect, vandalism and crime), while being exposed to either room air or subliminal levels of unpleasant (tar) or pleasant (cut grass) ambient odor. Whenever they encountered signs of disorder they reported their safety related concerns and associated affective feelings. Results: Signs of crime in the desktop VE were associated with negative affective feelings and concerns for personal safety and personal property. However, there was no significant difference between reported safety related concerns and affective connotations in the control (no-odor) and in each of the two ambient odor conditions. Conclusion: Ambient odor did not affect safety related concerns and affective connotations associated with signs of disorder in the desktop VE. Thus, semantic congruency between ambient odor and a desktop VE may not be sufficient to influence its affective appraisal, and a more realistic simulation in which simulated objects appear to emit scents may be required to achieve this goal. © 2013 Toet et al.",doi,10.1371/journal.pone.0078721,Scopus,PLoS ONE,"Toet A., Van Schaik M., Theunissen N.C.M.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Not So Doomed: Computer Game Play And Positive Adolescent Development.,"It has been speculated that computer game play by young people has negative correlates or consequences, although little evidence has emerged to support these fears. An alternative possibility is that game play may be associated with positive features of development, as the games reflect and contribute to participation in a challenging and stimulating voluntary leisure environment. This study examined the relationship between game play and several measures of adjustment or risk taking in a sample of 16-year-old high school students. No evidence was obtained of negative outcomes among game players. On several measures—including family closeness, activity involvement, positive school engagement, positive mental health, substance use, self-concept, friendship network, and disobedience to parents—game players scored more favorably than did peers who never played computer games. It is concluded that computer games can be a positive feature of a healthy adolescence.",doi,10.1016/S0193-3973(02)00124-7,anderson2010,Applied Developmental Psychology,"Durkin, K., Barber, B.",2002,NA,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Nurses' Knowledge And Skill Retention Following Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Training: A Review Of The Literature.,"This paper reports a literature review examining factors that enhance retention of knowledge and skills during and after resuscitation training, in order to identify educational strategies that will optimize survival for victims of cardiopulmonary arrest. Poor knowledge and skill retention following cardiopulmonary resuscitation training for nursing and medical staff has been documented over the past 20 years. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation training is mandatory for nursing staff and is important as nurses often discover the victims of in-hospital cardiac arrest. Many different methods of improving this retention have been devised and evaluated. However, the content and style of this training lack standardization. A literature review was undertaken using the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, MEDLINE and British Nursing Index databases and the keywords 'cardiopulmonary resuscitation', 'basic life support', 'advanced life support' and 'training'. Papers published between 1992 and 2002 were obtained and their reference lists scrutinized to identify secondary references, of these the ones published within the same 10-year period were also included. Those published in the English language that identified strategies to enhance the acquisition or retention of Cardiopulmonary resuscitation skills and knowledge were included in the review. One hundred and five primary and 157 secondary references were identified. Of these, 24 met the criteria and were included in the final literature sample. Four studies were found pertaining to cardiac arrest simulation, three to peer tuition, four to video self-instruction, three to the use of different resuscitation guidelines, three to computer-based learning programmes, two to voice-activated manikins, two to automated external defibrillators, one to self-instruction, one to gaming and the one to the use of action cards. Resuscitation training should be based on in-hospital scenarios and current evidence-based guidelines, including recognition of sick patients, and should be taught using simulations of a variety of cardiac arrest scenarios. This will ensure that the training reflects the potential situations that nurses may face in practice. Nurses in clinical areas, who rarely see cardiac arrests, should receive automated external defibrillation training and have access to defibrillators to prevent delays in resuscitation. Staff should be formally assessed using a manikin with a feedback mechanism or an expert instructor to ensure that chest compressions and ventilations are adequate at the time of training. Remedial training must be provided as often as required. Resuscitation training equipment should be made available at ward/unit level to allow self-study and practice to prevent deterioration between updates. Video self-instruction has been shown to improve competence in resuscitation.

,On The Effectiveness Of Service Differentiation Based Resource-Provision Incentive Mechanisms In Dynamic And Autonomous P2p Networks,"Intrinsically, P2P (Peer-to-Peer) networks are anonymous, dynamic and autonomous, which has the following implications: users can change their identities with near zero cost (cheap pseudonyms); most interactions should be one-time (that is, each peer has no idea about other peers' behavior history, except their current behaviors); and all behaviors and actions are all endogenous, voluntarily chosen and determined by independent and rational peers. On the other hand, service differentiation based incentive mechanisms are proposed in P2P networks, which basically could be provided with two ways: punish defect behavior (punishment-based scheme), or reward cooperative behavior (reward-based scheme). Then the naturally resulted question is that: under the above P2P networking environment, how to effectively design service differentiation based resource-provision incentive mechanisms? Our contributions are threefold. First, we found that the traditional service differentiation based incentive schemes cannot successfully encourage peers to contribute resource to the whole system, irrespective of punishment-based and reward-based schemes. Then, if peers can voluntarily join the system, and small entry fee is set for participation, we obtained that the performance of punishment-based scheme (first providing high-level service plus punishment) is always better than that of reward-based scheme (first providing low-level service plus reward). Finally, unlike the existing result that was based on persistent users' identities and truly repeated interactions, we illustrate that punisher's average payoff in punishment-based scheme is almost same as the ideal but unfeasible case of reward-based scheme: rewarder could selectively reward other rewarders, and reward cost is zero. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

,Ostracism And Physiological Arousal Following Traumatic Brain Injury,"Primary objective: This study aimed to examine the psychological and physiological effects of ostracism in adults with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Research design: A within-subject, counterbalanced design was used. The two conditions, inclusion and ostracism, were examined across two groups (between subjects). Methods and procedures: A group of 21 adults with TBI and 17 matched controls participated in the Cyberball paradigm. This task is a computerised task that exposes participants to a game of catch and throw. In the inclusion condition they are included fairly in the game, while in the ostracism condition they are excluded from the game following the first few throws. Skin conductance levels (SCLs) were measured throughout the game as a proxy for social stress. Main outcomes: Results showed that people with TBI were cognitively aware of when they are being ostracised, but that their self-reported emotional experience to social exclusion was different to that of the control group. Differences in SCLs between groups and between conditions did not reach significance nor did they correlate with behavioural responses. Conclusions: These findings are discussed in terms of the consequences of dissociation between psychological and physiological responses and the implications for motivating behaviours associated with re-inclusion. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",doi,10.1080/02699052.2016.1271457,Scopus,Brain Injury,"Kelly M., McDonald S., Rushby J.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Parents' And Children's Perceptions Of Active Video Games: A Focus Group Study,"Energy expenditure studies have shown that playing Active Video Games (AVGs) is positively associated with increases in heart rate and oxygen consumption. It is proposed that playing AVGs may be a useful means of addressing inactivity and obesity in children. This study explored children's and parents' perceptions of AVGs and the likely facilitators and barriers to sustained use of AVGs. Data were gathered using focus group interviews: seven with children, four with adults. Both children and parents reported that AVGs offered a way to increase activity and improve fitness. Barriers to sustained engagement, according to parents, were the cost of AVGs and lack of space in the home to play the games. According to children, the likelihood of long-term engagement with AVGs depended on game content and child age, with AVGs being seen as more appropriate for younger children than teenagers. It would appear that there is potential for AVGs to reduce inactivity in young people. However, barriers to widespread, sustainable adoption would need to be addressed if this potential is to be realized. © The Author(s) 2010.",doi,10.1177/1367493509359173,Scopus,Journal of Child Health Care,"Dixon R., Maddison R., Mhurchu C.N., Jull A., Meagher-Lundberg P., Widdowson D.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Patterns Of And Motivations For Concurrent Use Of Video Games And Substances,"""Behavioral addictions"" share biological mechanisms with substance dependence, and ""drug interactions"" have been observed between certain substances and self-reinforcing behaviors. This study examines correlates of patterns of and motivations for playing video games while using or feeling the effects of a substance (concurrent use). Data were drawn from a nationally-representative survey of adult Americans who ""regularly"" or ""occasionally"" played video games and had played for at least one hour in the past seven days (n = 3,380). Only recent concurrent users' data were included in analyses (n = 1,196). Independent variables included demographics, substance use frequency and problems, game genre of concurrent use (identified by looking titles up in an industry database), and general game playing variables including problem video game play (PVP), consumer involvement, enjoyment, duration, and frequency of play. Exploratory factor analysis identified the following dimensions underlying patterns of and motivations for concurrent use: pass time or regulate negative emotion, enhance an already enjoyable or positive experience, and use of video games and substances to remediate each other's undesirable effects. Multivariate regression analyses indicated PVP and hours/day of video game play were associated with most patterns/motivations, as were caffeine, tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, and painkiller use problems. This suggests that concurrent use with some regular situational pattern or effect-seeking motivation is part of the addictive process underlying both PVP and substance dependence. Various demographic, game playing, game genre of concurrent use, and substance use variables were associated with specific motivations/patterns, indicating that all are important in understanding concurrent use. © 2011 by the authors.

,"Personality Factors, Subject Gender, And The Effects Of Aggressive Video Games On Aggression In Adolescents","Male and female adolescents served as subjects in an experiment designed to assess the relationship among personality factors, heart rate, and aggression after having played an aggressive video game. For males, personality traits and heart rate were separately related to aggression. Personality characteristics similar to those of the Type A individual were related in a positive direction to heart rate in females. The content of the video games did not affect heart rate or postgame aggression, even though females displayed greater mean heart rate than males throughout the experiment. The results are discussed with regard to sex role stereotypes, content-related explanations of aggression, and Type A personality characteristics.

,Personality Trait And Facial Expression Filter-Based Brain-Computer Interface,"In this paper, we present technical approaches that bridge the gap in the research related to the use of braincomputer interfaces for entertainment and facial expressions. Such facial expressions that reflect an individual's personal traits can be used to better realize artificial facial expressions in a gaming environment based on a brain-computer interface. First, an emotion extraction filter is introduced in order to classify emotions on the basis of the users' brain signals in real time. Next, a personality trait filter is defined to classify extrovert and introvert types, which manifest as five traits: very extrovert, extrovert, medium, introvert and very introvert. In addition, facial expressions derived from expression rates are obtained by an extrovert-introvert fuzzy model through its defuzzification process. Finally, we confirm this validation via an analysis of the variance of the personality trait filter, a k-fold cross validation of the emotion extraction filter, an accuracy analysis, a user study of facial synthesis and a test case game. © 2013 Chin and Lee.",doi,10.5772/55665,Scopus,International Journal of Advanced Robotic Systems,"Chin S., Lee C.-Y.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Personified And Multistate Camera Motions For First-Person Navigation In Desktop Virtual Reality,"In this paper we introduce novel ""Camera Motions"" (CMs) to improve the sensations related to locomotion in virtual environments (VE). Traditional Camera Motions are artificial oscillating motions applied to the subjective viewpoint when walking in the VE, and they are meant to evoke and reproduce the visual flow generated during a human walk. Our novel camera motions are: (1) multistate, (2) personified, and (3) they can take into account the topography of the virtual terrain. Being multistate, our CMs can account for different states of locomotion in VE namely: walking, but also running and sprinting. Being personified, our CMs can be adapted to avatar's physiology such as to its size, weight or training status. They can then take into account avatar's fatigue and recuperation for updating visual CMs accordingly. Last, our approach is adapted to the topography of the VE. Running over a strong positive slope would rapidly decrease the advance speed of the avatar, increase its energy loss, and eventually change the locomotion mode, influencing the visual feedback of the camera motions. Our new approach relies on a locomotion simulator partially inspired by human physiology and implemented for a real-time use in Desktop VR. We have conducted a series of experiments to evaluate the perception of our new CMs by naive participants. Results notably show that participants could discriminate and perceive transitions between the different locomotion modes, by relying exclusively on our CMs. They could also perceive some properties of the avatar being used and, overall, very well appreciated the new CMs techniques. Taken together, our results suggest that our new CMs could be introduced in Desktop VR applications involving first-person navigation, in order to enhance sensations of walking, running, and sprinting, with potentially different avatars and over uneven terrains, such as for: training, virtual visits or video games. © 2013 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TVCG.2013.38,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics,"Terziman L., Marchal M., Multon F., Arnaldi B., Lécuyer A.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Physical Activity And Screen Time In Metabolically Healthy Obese Phenotypes In Adolescents And Adults,"Introduction. The purpose of this study was to examine levels of physical activity (PA) and screen time (ST) in metabolically healthy obese (MHO) and metabolically unhealthy obese (MUO) adolescents and adults. Methods. NHANES data from obese adolescents (12-18 years, BMI z-score ≥ 95th percentile) and adults (19-85 years, BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) were pooled from 2003-2005 cycles. Metabolic phenotypes were categorized as MHO (0 or 1 cardiometabolic risk factor; triglycerides, HDL-C, blood pressure, or glucose) or MUO (≥2 cardiometabolic risk factors). Logistic regression models estimated associations between phenotype and PA/ST adjusted for age, gender, BMI, race/ethnicity, menopausal status, and NHANES cycle. Results. Among adolescents, PA was not associated with MHO. In contrast, MHO adults 19-44 years were 85% more likely to engage in active transportation and 2.7 times more likely to be involved in light intensity usual daily activity versus sitting. For each minute per day, adults 45-85 years were 36% more likely to have the MHO phenotype with higher levels of moderate PA. ST was not associated with metabolic phenotypes in adolescents or adults. Conclusion. The current study provides evidence that PA, but not ST, differs between MHO and MUO in adults, but not in adolescents. Future studies are needed to confirm results. © 2013 Sarah M.

,Physiological And Psychophysiological Responses In Experienced Players While Playing Different Dance Exer-Games,"Abstract As exer-game technology is increasingly integrated into workout and rehabilitation programs, it is important to understand how physical exertion, hedonics, and game usability experiences affect the knowledgeable player. In a repeated measures experiment, seven experienced players played five popular dance exer-games on separate days. Exertion was measured using indirect calorimetry. Hedonic experience was measured using questions about engagement and game-flow. Platform and software usability was determined by questionnaire and percent time spent in non-play activities (menu interfaces, software loading). Mean MET levels ranged from 4.26 to 9.18 during gameplay, depending on the game. Player engagement and game-flow were closely related to MET activity. Usability scores were closely related to time spent in non-play activities. Games with increased MET levels and higher usability scores were reflected in higher engagement and game-flow scores. Degree of interface embodiment did not affect these outcomes. Based on these results, problems in usability are barriers to engagement. Designing games that provide a balance of challenge, immersion, and engagement is a difficult task. These results demonstrate the importance of examining players of varying skill levels in order to fully understand the interaction of physical exertion, platform usability and player engagement. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.chb.2015.04.047,Scopus,Computers in Human Behavior,"Bronner S., Pinsker R., Noah J.A.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Physiological Indicators Of Pathologic Video Game Use In Adolescence,"Purpose Pathologic video game use (PVGU) has been associated with a host of negative psychological, physical, and social outcomes during adolescence; however, little research has examined physiological predictors of such use. The purpose of the study was to examine physiological predictors of the development of PVGU across adolescence. Methods The article involves a 1-year longitudinal study across midadolescence. Participants were 374 adolescents and their parents from a large metropolitan area in the Northwest United States. PVGU was assessed via questionnaire, as were a number of control variables. A number of physiological indicators including respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and galvanic skin conductance (indices of parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system activity, respectively) were measured during baseline, a cognitively stimulating task (Rubik's cube), and a family problem-solving task. Results Less RSA withdrawal to a cognitively simulating task was related to greater pathologic video game symptoms, but less RSA withdrawal to a family problem-solving task was associated with the presence of pathologic video game symptoms (p <.05). For girls only, galvanic skin conductance activation during the family problem solving was related to greater pathologic video game symptoms (p <.01). Conclusions These findings suggest that adolescents who do not find cognitive tasks stimulating physiologically have a greater severity of PVGU. Additionally, adolescents who show physiological signs of stress in a family task were more likely to have PVGU symptoms and only girls have more severe PVGU levels. This study is the first to show that physiological indicators predict PVGU over time in adolescence and has important implications regarding the prevention and treatment of PVGU in adolescence. © 2015 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.",doi,10.1016/j.jadohealth.2014.10.271,Scopus,Journal of Adolescent Health,"Coyne S.M., Dyer W.J., Densley R., Money N.M., Day R.D., Harper J.M.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Physiological Signal Analysis For Evaluating Flow During Playing Of Computer Games Of Varying Difficulty,"Flow is the experience of effortless attention, reduced self-consciousness, and a deep sense of control that typically occurs during the optimal performance of challenging tasks. On the basis of the person-artifact-task model, we selected computer games (tasks) with varying levels of difficulty (difficult, medium, and easy) and shyness (personality) as flow precursors to study the physiological activity of users in a flow state. Cardiac and respiratory activity and mean changes in skin conductance (SC) were measured continuously while the participants (n = 40) played the games. Moreover, the associations between self-reported psychological flow and physiological measures were investigated through a series of repeated-measures analyses. The results showed that the flow experience is related to a faster respiratory rate, deeper respiration, moderate heart rate (HR), moderate HR variability, and moderate SC. The main effect of shyness was non-significant, whereas the interaction of shyness and difficulty influenced the flow experience. These findings are discussed in relation to current models of arousal and valence. The results indicate that the flow state is a state of moderate mental effort that arises through the increased parasympathetic modulation of sympathetic activity. © 2017 Tian, Bian, Han, Wang, Gao and Chen.",doi,10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01121,Scopus,Frontiers in Psychology,"Tian Y., Bian Y., Han P., Wang P., Gao F., Chen Y.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Physiological Stress Response To Video-Game Playing: The Contribution Of Built-In Music,"Recent studies on video game playing have uncovered a wide range of measurable physiological effects on the organism, such as increases in cardiovascular activity and breathing responses. However, the exact source of these effects remains unclear. Given the well-known effects of sound on physiological activity, especially those of noise and of music, and on the secretion of the stress hormone cortisol in particular, we hypothesized that music may be a major source of stress during video game playing. We thus examined the effect of built-in music on cortisol secretion as a consequence of video game playing. Players were assigned quasi-randomly to either a Music or a Silence condition. Four saliva samples were taken, that is, after practice (T1), immediately after having played for 10 minutes (T2), 15 minutes after the end of the experiment (T3), and 30 minutes after the end of the experiment (T4). The results show that the Music group had significantly higher cortisol levels at T3, that is, when cortisol levels are assumed to reflect the stress induced by the game. These findings suggest for the first time that the auditory input contributes significantly to the stress response found during video game playing. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

,"Physiological, Movement And Technical Demands Of Centre-Wicket Battlezone, Traditional Net-Based Training And One-Day Cricket Matches: A Comparative Study Of Sub-Elite Cricket Players","This study compared physiological, physical and technical demands of Battlezone, traditional cricket training and one-day matches. Data were initially collected from 11 amateur, male cricket players (age: 22.2 ± 3.3 year, height: 1.82 ± 0.06 m body mass: 80.4 ± 9.8 kg) during four Battlezone and four traditional cricket training sessions encompassing different playing positions. Heart rate, blood lactate concentration, rating of perceived exertion and movement patterns of players were measured. Retrospective video analysis was performed to code for technical outcomes. Similar data were collected from 42 amateur, male cricket players (23.5 ± 4.7 year, 1.81 ± 0.07 m, 81.4 ± 11.4 kg) during one-day matches. Significant differences were found between Battlezone, traditional cricket training and one-day matches within each playing position. Specifically, Battlezone invoked the greatest physiological and physical demands from batsmen in comparison to traditional cricket training and one-day matches. However, the greatest technical demand for batsmen was observed during traditional cricket training. In regards to the other playing positions, a greater physiological, physical and technical demand was observed during Battlezone and traditional training than during one-day matches. These results suggest that the use of Battlezone and traditional cricket training provides players with a suitable training stimulus for replicating the physiological, physical and technical demands of one-day cricket. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",doi,10.1080/02640414.2013.861605,Scopus,Journal of Sports Sciences,"Vickery W., Dascombe B., Duffield R.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Pilot Development Of An Electronic Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease Quiz Game,"Objectives: Data suggest physicians poorly assess disease-specific literacy and transition readiness in pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).We piloted an electronic, interactive iPad quiz game that could be used in a clinical setting, with the aims of measuring IBD-related knowledge, and concomitant mood and quality of life (QOL) in a pediatric population. Methods: Two pediatric IBD clinics developed and tested 2 versions of ""Emma."" Patients between 10 and 18 years of age played Emma during an office visit. Each patient answered 12 randomly selected disease-related questions and 4 mood-related questions. Results: Sites 1 and 2 tested Emma v1 between May and August 2013. Emma v2 was tested from November 2013 to January 2014 and from September 2013 to January 2014. A total of 56 patients played Emma v1, whereas 60 played Emma v2. In Emma v2, 73.1% of questions were answered correctly. Patients recognized signs of IBD (88%), causes of diarrhea in addition to IBD (79.4%), and could define lactose intolerance (95.8%), but fewer patients understood serological testing used for disease monitoring (68%) or knew that magnetic resonance enterography did not involve radiation (22.9%). Patients tended to report good functioning in the areas of energy, mood, anxiety, and school-related QOL. Patients with Crohn disease, however, reported higher stress levels compared with patients with ulcerative colitis; older patients reported lower energy levels, and postsurgical patients reported lower QOL. Conclusions: The Emma iPad game has the potential to evaluate gaps in IBD knowledge, assess emotional functioning, and increase patient engagement as a transition tool in the clinical setting. © Copyright 2015 by ESPGHAN and NASPGHAN.

,Playing By The Rules: Parental Mediation Of Video Game Play,"This study examined parental mediation of children’s video game play in an Internet survey of 433 parents of children aged 5 to 18 years. We assessed the valence of active mediation (i.e., positive, negative, neutral) and the relationship between parental involvement and mediation techniques. Furthermore, we explored whether parental mediation was associated with child delinquency. Our results demonstrate that active mediation is generally negative or neutral in nature. Involved parents were more likely to use each mediation strategy than less involved parents; however, parental involvement did not predict negative mediation. Restrictive and negative mediation were significantly related to child delinquency. In sum, the findings show that parents are involved in monitoring their children’s use of this medium, just as they are with television. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.",doi,10.1177/0192513X15613822,Scopus,Journal of Family Issues,"Martins N., Matthews N.L., Ratan R.A.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,"Playing With Power: Power Poses Affect Enjoyment, Presence, Controller Responsiveness, And Arousal When Playing Natural Motion-Controlled Video Games","Though playing with natural versus traditional game controllers affects game experiences, studies have not investigated how power poses affect the experience of playing natural controlled video games. Participants keeping powerful poses experienced increased enjoyment, presence, and controller responsiveness compared with those holding powerless poses. Congruent with self-perception and automatic activation models, mediation analyses uncovered direct effects of power poses and also indirect effects in which power poses increased power feelings, which in turn were associated with higher enjoyment, presence, and controller responsiveness but reduced arousal. This provides initial evidence for how physical poses affect people's experiences with natural game interfaces, and highlight basic self-perception and automatic activation mechanisms behind the effect. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",doi,10.1016/j.chb.2017.02.019,Scopus,Computers in Human Behavior,"Peña J., Chen M.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,"Playing With Trauma: Interreactivity, Empathy, And Complicity In The Walking Dead Video Game","Just as books and films about traumatic events have become part of Western popular culture, so the theme of trauma and its accompanying tropes have been seeping into video games over the last two decades. In spite of the discernible trauma trend within video games, however, and the potential they exhibit for representing trauma in new ways, they have received very little critical notice from trauma theorists. In this article, we argue that a trauma-theoretical study of games has much to offer our understanding of the ways that trauma can be represented, in addition to giving game studies scholars further insight into how games manage to elicit such strong emotions and difficult ethical quandaries in players. We demonstrate this by performing a close reading of one recent and much-discussed game, The Walking Dead: Season One, analyzing how it incorporates psychological trauma in terms of inter(re)activity, empathy, and complicity. © The Author(s) 2014.",doi,10.1177/1555412014559306,Scopus,Games and Culture,"Smethurst T., Craps S.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,"Pleasing Frowns, Disappointing Smiles: An Erp Investigation Of Counterempathy","The biological predisposition to resonate emotionally with another person is regarded as a critical aspect of social interaction. There are, however, situations in which the emotional response to others is discordant with their emotional experience. Using event-related potentials, the present study investigated the neural underpinnings of this phenomenon, termed "" counterempathy."" Participants played a card game under the belief that they were playing jointly with another player who sat in an adjoining room and whose smiles and frowns in response to winning or losing in the game they could observe on a computer screen. Depending upon the experimental setting, the other player's facial expressions conveyed either of two opposing values to the participant. In the empathic setting, his emotional expressions were congruent with the participant's outcome (win or loss), whereas in the counterempathic setting, they indicated incongruent outcomes. Results revealed a reversed pattern of brain responses to facial expressions between congruent and incongruent conditions at ~170 ms (N170) over the temporal cortex. That is, N170 was sensitive to frowns in the congruent condition and to smiles in the incongruent condition, both indicating losses for the participant. Furthermore, frowns in the incongruent condition yielded larger medial frontal negativity (MFN) over the medial prefrontal cortex, which correlated with the subjective pleasantness about one's own winning in the incongruent condition. These findings demonstrate that (1) counterempathic responses are associated with modulation of early sensory processing of emotional cues, (2) that MFN is sensitive to the detection of another person's loss during positive inequity, and (3) that MFN is associated with a pleasant feeling during positive inequity, which is possibly related to "" Schadenfreude"". © 2011 American Psychological Association.",doi,10.1037/a0023854,Scopus,Emotion,"Yamada M., Lamm C., Decety J.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,"Positive Emotions Associated With ""Counter-Strike"" Game Playing","Objective: Digital game playing engages people for long periods of time. The pleasure offered by digital games may explain the players' consumption of this activity. Games may elicit both positive and negative emotions, which can be measured by encephalography (EEG). The EEG alpha asymmetry index (AI) is different in positive and negative emotions and so may be used to distinguish positive from negative emotions that occur during gaming. We hypothesized that the ""Counter-Strike"" (CS) game (Valve Software, Bellevue, WA) is pleasurable and demonstrable with a positive EEG AI. Subjects and Methods: Twelve male participants ages 18-30 years underwent EEG recordings continuously during and postgame. EEG was also recorded pregame for control conditions of baseline (sitting on a chair staring at a blank wall), movement (moving fingers on the computer keyboard with a blank screen), sound (listening to the sound of the CS game with a blank screen), and screen (watching the CS game without playing). Self-ratings of emotional responses were completed at pre-, during, and postgame. Results: A significant decrease in the EEG AI was observed under the screen condition compared with baseline, whereas an increase was observed postgame compared with the screen condition. The participants demonstrated a positive EEG AI following the ""shoot"" events (shoot opponents) and negative emotions after the ""being shot"" events. Subjective ratings of emotional response indicated happiness during and postgame, but anger and arousal were reported only during the game. Conclusions: The overall results are consistent with the hypothesis that predominantly positive emotional reactions are elicited from playing the CS game and concur with positive subjective ratings of happiness. Future studies may explore the relationship of game pleasure and obsessive game play. © 2012 Copyright Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",doi,10.1089/g4h.2012.0010,Scopus,Games for Health Journal,"Shin M., Heard R., Suo C., Chow C.M.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Potassium Intake And Cardiovascular Reactivity In Children With Risk Factors For Essential Hypertension,"Objectives: Our study objectives were as follows: (1) to determine whether urinary excretion of potassium is lower in black than in white children, (2) to determine whether cardiovascular reactivity (CVR) varies inversely with dietary intake of potassium, and (3) to confirm that CVR is greater in black than in white children, and in children with a family history of hypertension than in those without such a history. Study design: Baseline measurements included 24-hour urinary sodium, potassium, and creatinine levels and food intake (by questionnaire). Resting and stress blood pressures were measured during blood sampling, cold water foot immersion, and a video game before and after 1 week each of supplementation with potassium citrate, 1.5 mmol/kg per day, and placebo administered in random order. Results: Thirty-nine children aged 7 to 15 years were studied. White subjects had higher baseline excretion of potassium than black subjects (p < 0.001) and higher vegetable intake (p < 0.01), which were positively correlated (r = 0.53, p < 0.001). At baseline, the 24-hour urinary potassium/creatinine ratio varied inversely with diastolic CVR to the video game stressor in white children (r = -0.55, p = 0.02). Cardiovascular reactivity was not attenuated measurably by potassium supplementation compared with placebo. The CVR was greater in children with a family history of hypertension than in those without, but was not greater in black children than in white children. Conclusions: The urinary potassium/creatinine ratio is higher in white than black children because their intake of vegetables is greater; dietary potassium intake may modulate CVR, particularly in white children with a family history of hypertension, but may need to be supplemented for more than 1 week to demonstrate attenuation of CVR; and a family history of hypertension may be a stronger predictor of enhanced CVR than is race.",doi,10.1016/S0022-3476(97)70129-X,Scopus,Journal of Pediatrics,"Sorof J.M., Forman A., Cole N., Jemerin J.M., Morris R.C.",1997,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Potential Cardiovascular And Total Mortality Benefits Of Air Pollution Control In Urban China,"BACKGROUND: Outdoor air pollution ranks fourth among preventable causes of China's burden of disease. We hypothesized that the magnitude of health gains from air quality improvement in urban China could compare with achieving recommended blood pressure or smoking control goals.METHODS: The Cardiovascular Disease Policy Model-China projected coronary heart disease, stroke, and all-cause deaths in urban Chinese adults 35 to 84 years of age from 2017 to 2030 if recent air quality (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 µm, PM2.5) and traditional cardiovascular risk factor trends continue. We projected life-years gained if urban China were to reach 1 of 3 air quality goals: Beijing Olympic Games level (mean PM2.5, 55 μg/m3), China Class II standard (35 μg/m3), or World Health Organization standard (10 μg/m3). We compared projected air pollution reduction control benefits with potential benefits of reaching World Health Organization hypertension and tobacco control goals.RESULTS: Mean PM2.5 reduction to Beijing Olympic levels by 2030 would gain ≈241,000 (95% uncertainty interval, 189 000-293 000) life-years annually. Achieving either the China Class II or World Health Organization PM2.5 standard would yield greater health benefits (992 000 [95% uncertainty interval, 790 000-1 180 000] or 1 827 000 [95% uncertainty interval, 1 481 00-2 129 000] annual life-years gained, respectively) than World Health Organization-recommended goals of 25% improvement in systolic hypertension control and 30% reduction in smoking combined (928 000 [95% uncertainty interval, 830 000-1 033 000] life-years).CONCLUSIONS: Air quality improvement in different scenarios could lead to graded health benefits ranging from 241 000 life-years gained to much greater benefits equal to or greater than the combined benefits of 25% improvement in systolic hypertension control and 30% smoking reduction. © 2017 American Heart Association, Inc.",doi,10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.026487,Scopus,Circulation,"Huang C., Moran A.E., Coxson P.G., Yang X., Liu F., Cao J., Chen K., Wang M., He J., Goldman L., Zhao D., Kinney P.L., Gu D.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Pre-Pregnancy Stress Reactivity And Pregnancy Outcome,"Stress has been proposed as a cause of preterm birth (PTB) and small-for-gestational age (SGA), but stress does not have the same effects on all women. It may be that a woman's reaction to stress relates to her pregnancy health, and previous studies indicate that higher reactivity is associated with reduced birthweight and gestational age. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between pre-pregnancy cardiovascular reactivity to stress and pregnancy outcome. The sample included 917 women in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study who had cardiovascular reactivity measured in 1987-88 and at least one subsequent singleton livebirth within an 18-year period. Cardiovascular reactivity was measured using a video game, star tracing and cold pressor test. Gestational age and birthweight were based on the women's self-report, with PTB defined as birth <37 weeks' gestation and SGA as weight <10th percentile for gestational age. Linear and Poisson regression and generalised estimating equations were used to model the relationship between reactivity to stress and birth outcomes with control for confounders. Few associations were seen between reactivity and pregnancy outcomes. Higher pre-pregnancy diastolic blood pressure (adjusted relative risk 1.14; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.98, 1.34) and mean arterial pressure reactivity (1.15; 0.98, 1.36) were associated with risk of PTB at first pregnancy, while SGA was associated with lower systolic blood pressure reactivity (0.76; 0.60, 0.95). No associations were seen with other measures of reactivity. Contrary to hypothesis, the association between heart rate reactivity and PTB in first pregnancy was stronger in whites (adjusted relative risk 1.39; 1.03, 1.88) than in blacks (1.00; 0.83, 1.20; P for interaction=0.08). Similar results were found for mean arterial pressure. No strong associations were found between higher pre-pregnancy stress reactivity and SGA or PTB, and stress reactivity did not have a stronger association with birth outcomes in blacks than whites. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",doi,10.1111/j.1365-3016.2010.01152.x,Scopus,Paediatric and Perinatal Epidemiology,"Harville E.W., Gunderson E.P., Matthews K.A., Lewis C.E., Carnethon M.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Predicting Energy Expenditure From Accelerometry Counts In Adolescents Girls,"Purpose: Calibration of accelerometer counts against oxygen consumption to predict energy expenditure has not been conducted in middle school girls. We concurrently assessed energy expenditure and accelerometer counts during physical activities on adolescent girls to develop an equation to predict energy expenditure. Methods: Seventy-four girls aged 13-14 yr performed 10 activities while wearing an Actigraph accelerometer and a portable metabolic measurement unit (Cosmed K4b2). The activities were resting, watching television, playing a computer game, sweeping, walking 2.5 and 3.5 mph, performing step aerobics, shooting a basketball, climbing stairs, and running 5 mph. Height and weight were also assessed. Mixed-model regression was used to develop an equation to predict energy expenditure (EE) (kJ·min-1) from accelerometer counts. Results: Age (mean [SD] = 14 yr [0.34]) and body-weight-adjusted correlations of accelerometer counts with EE (kJ·min-1) for individual activities ranged from -0.14 to 0.59. Higher intensity activities with vertical motion were best correlated. A regression model that explained 85% of the variance of EE was developed: [EE (kJ·m-1) = 7.6628 + 0.1462 [(Actigraph counts per minute - 3000)/100] + 0.2371 (body weight in kilograms) - 0.00216 [(Actigraph counts per minute - 3000)/100]2 + 0.004077 [((Actigraph counts per minute - 3000)/100) x (body weight in kilograms)]. The MCCC = 0.85, with a standard error of estimate = 5.61 kJ·min-1. Conclusions: We developed a prediction equation for kilojoules per minute of energy expenditure from Actigraph accelerometer counts. This equation may be most useful for predicting energy expenditure in groups of adolescent girls over a period of time that will include activities of broad-ranging intensity, and may be useful to intervention researchers interested in objective measures of physical activity.",doi,10.1249/01.MSS.0000150084.97823.F7,Scopus,Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise,"Schmitz K.H., Treuth M., Hannan P., Mcmurray R., Ring K.B., Catellier D., Pate R.",2005,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Press C→ To Play The Ocarina: Rhetoric And Game Music,"The purpose of this chapter is to investigate the intersection where digital media studies meet rhetoric and rhetoric is re-introduced to musicology. In the recent academic excitement surrounding game studies, the music of games has been overshadowed. The author would like to call attention to the significance of game music and to consider a rhetorical method to approaching it that calls upon a rekindling of the history of coupling rhetoric with music. The author builds on this history by suggesting the foundation of a rhetorical framework for understanding the argumentative power of video game songs. He then moves to offer an approach for evaluating the ethos of game music that consists of assessing worlds and how they are carried through, and by, music. While 17th century baroque composers thought music to be fundamentally an issue of affections-and especially played off of emotional binaries such as joy/sadness as a rhetorical approach-the author hope to here revive this lost art of applying rhetoric to music through broadening the discussion beyond the matter of human emotion. This rhetorical approach allows the individual a framework with which to evaluate the ethos of game music as it now appears through numerous mobile operating systems, online environments, and as remediated forms manifesting in/as cultural artifacts. As games become ubiquitous, so do their songs. © 2013, IGI Global.",doi,10.4018/978-1-4666-2663-8.ch021,Scopus,Online Credibility and Digital Ethos: Evaluating Computer-Mediated Communication,Lawrence D.W.,2012,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Price Dynamics And Quality In Information Markets,"We explore the price dynamics of a vertically differentiated market in which two or more sellers compete to provide an information good or service to a population of buyers. Each seller offers the good or service at a fixed level of 'quality', and attempts to set its price in such a way that it maximizes its own profit. Five different seller pricing strategies, ranging widely from ones that require perfect knowledge and unlimited computational power to ones that require very little knowledge or computational capability, are employed in two different buyer populations. The resulting collective dynamics are studied using a combination of analysis and simulation. In a population of quality-sensitive buyers, all pricing strategies lead to a price equilibrium predicted by a game-theoretic analysis. However, in a population of price-sensitive buyers, most pricing strategies lead to large-amplitude cyclical price wars. The circumstances under which cyclical price wars occur can be explained in terms of the topology of an underlying 'profit landscape' [J.O. Kephart, J.E. Hanson, J. Sairamesh, Price and niche wars in a free-market economy of software agents, Artificial Life Journal, 4(1), 1998, 1-23].",doi,10.1016/S0167-9236(99)00073-1,Scopus,Decision Support Systems,"Sairamesh J., Kephart J.O.",2e3,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Prototyping N-Reasons: A Computer Mediated Ethics Machine,"Much work in machine ethics attempts to implement ethical theory in autonomous, situated machines – robots. Our previous work in robot ethics falls at the extreme of very simple virtual agents programmed with moral strategies for simple games (Danielson 1992). Even at this extreme, ethics is surprisingly complex. Our later evolvable agents discovered some strategies unexplored by the rational choice ethics literature (Danielson 1996; Danielson 1998; Danielson 2002). Twenty years ago, Dennett was skeptical of this branch of machine ethics: “[N]o remotely compelling system of ethics has ever been made computationally tractable, even indirectly, for real-world moral problems” (Dennett 1989, p. 129). We leave this approach to other contributors in this collection. In contrast, there is the branch of machine ethics that constructs machines to advise people making ethical decisions. Our present work falls here, or so we shall argue. We have developed an innovative survey research platform – N-Reasons – to explore robot ethics at the first level and machine ethics at the second. The question of interest for this volume is if the N-Reasons platform can be usefully seen as a machine. This contrast is interesting in another way relevant to our project. Working on Artificial Morality, the skeptical question I most often faced was, “How could a machine be moral?” The emerging technology of robotics, however, has caught up with some of this skepticism. © Cambridge University Press 2011.",doi,10.1017/CBO9780511978036.025,Scopus,Machine Ethics,Danielson P.,2011,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,"Psychological Needs, Purpose In Life, And Problem Video Game Playing Among Chinese Young Adults","The negative impacts of excessive and problematic video game playing on both children and adults are attracting increasing concern. Based on self-determination theory (SDT; Ryan & Deci, 2000), this study hypothesized that the three basic psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness are positively associated with purpose in life, which in turn acts as a protective factor against problem video game playing among Chinese young adult players. Through a questionnaire survey with a sample of 165 Chinese adults aged between 18 and 30 years (mean age = 22.7 years), we found that perceived autonomy, competence, relatedness, and purpose in life were all negatively correlated with problem game playing. The demographic and psychological factors explained 38% of the variances of problem game playing. Specifically, gender, perceived relatedness, and purpose in life emerged as the three most salient predictors of problem game playing among the Chinese young adults. The mediating role of purpose in life was evidenced and it was found that purpose in life mediated the influences of the psychological needs proposed by SDT on problem game playing. Moreover, young men were significantly more susceptible to problem game playing than their female counterparts. To conclude, psychological needs and purpose in life influenced Chinese young adults' vulnerability to problem game playing directly or indirectly. Intervention programs that encourage social involvement and voluntary work, as well as counseling service that helps clients to search for life purpose, are suggested for intervening in problem game playing among Chinese young adults. © 2013 Copyright International Union of Psychological Science.",doi,10.1080/00207594.2012.658057,Scopus,International Journal of Psychology,"Wu A.M.S., Lei L.L.M., Ku L.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Psychopathy And Selective Attention During Performance Of A Complex Perceptual‐Motor Task,"Autonomic and electrocortical activity were recorded while prison inmates with high (H) and low (L) ratings of psychopathy were presented with a series of binaural tone pips, either by themselves (passive attention) or while video games were being played (selective attention). During selective attention the subjects were told that the tone pips were irrelevant to the primary task, the video games. The N100 component of the auditory evoked potential was used as an index of attention paid to the tone pips, while performance on the video games was considered to be a reflection of attentiveness to the primary task. There were no group differences in N100 amplitude or latency during passive attention, supporting the results from several previous studies. During selective attention Group H gave small N100 responses to the tone pips during each video game trial, including the first one, while Group L gave large N100 responses to the tone pips during the first trial, and small responses during later trials. Both groups performed equally well during the first few trials, but while the performance of Group L continued to improve, that of Group H deteriorated over the last few trials. The results were interpreted in terms of limited capacity models of attention, and provided some support for the hypothesis that psychopaths allocate a relatively large proportion of their attentional resources to things of immediate interest, effectively ignoring other stimuli.

,Pulse-Driven Magnetoimpedance Sensor Detection Of Cardiac Magnetic Activity,"This study sought to establish a convenient method for detecting biomagnetic activity in the heart. Electrical activity of the heart simultaneously induces a magnetic field. Detection of this magnetic activity will enable non-contact, noninvasive evaluation to be made. We improved the sensitivity of a pulse-driven magnetoimpedance (PMI) sensor, which is used as an electric compass in mobile phones and as a motion sensor of the operation handle in computer games, toward a pico-Tesla (pT) level, and measured magnetic fields on the surface of the thoracic wall in humans. The changes in magnetic field detected by this sensor synchronized with the electric activity of the electrocardiogram (ECG). The shape of the magnetic wave was largely altered by shifting the sensor position within 20 mm in parallel and/or perpendicular to the thoracic wall. The magnetic activity was maximal in the 4th intercostals near the center of the sterna. Furthermore, averaging the magnetic activity at 15 mm in the distance between the thoracic wall and the sensor demonstrated magnetic waves mimicking the P wave and QRS complex. The present study shows the application of PMI sensor in detecting cardiac magnetic activity in several healthy subjects, and suggests future applications of this technology in medicine and biology. © 2011 Nakayama et al.",doi,10.1371/journal.pone.0025834,Scopus,PLoS ONE,"Nakayama S., Sawamura K., Mohri K., Uchiyama T.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Pupillary Changes Due To Work Using Visual Display Terminals,"In order to measure the degree of ocular fatigue and general fatigue among the workers using visual display terminal (VDT), pupillary dynamics were measured with open-loop light stimulation for 26 subjects of a mean age of 25.9 years. VDT loads were TV games for 30 min under indirect light of 100 lux. The eight parameters of pupillary light reflex with open-loop pupillometer were examined before and after VDT loads. On the right eyes, two parameters and one value increased 9.2% (Student's t-test: P<0.005, max.), 25.7% (Student's t-test: P< 0.005, Min.) and 14.8% (Student's t-test: P< 0.005, min/max) just after the load and then gradually decreased and returned to the pre-load level after a 10 to 15-min rest period. Two parameters increased 11.7% (Student's t-test: P<0.05, Min.) and 12.9% (Student's t-test: P< 0.05, VD), one parameter decreased -9.0% (Student's t-test: P<0.05, 0.63D) and three parameters were constant (Student's t-test: L, A and VC) just after the load. On the left eyes, the same tendencies were observed. But there were no significant differences (Student's Mest) between the right and left eyes. The change pattern of the eight parameters were small in degree and similar to the changes when the sympathetic nervous system was activated. © 1988 Springer-Verlag.",doi,10.1007/BF00378478,Scopus,International Archives of Occupational and Environmental Health,"Harima M., Horiguchi S., Karai I., Takise S., Matumura S., Tojo F., Miki T.",1988,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Raising Perceptual Awareness Of The Fe Teacher: A Teaching Appraisal Technique,"It is a matter of some importance for institutions of further and higher education to investigate ways of improving teaching effectiveness. Many studies have been undertaken in both Europe and elsewhere. These have, in general, been published in the academic journals and a number of conferences have been held to discuss the techniques proposed. Almost without exception, the proposals which have been considered rely on behaviourally orientated methodologies akin to the many techniques currently in use in the USA (and in other countries where teaching assessment is common practice). It has been the author’s contention that such techniques are an inappropriate way of improving teaching effectiveness as they demand a pre-specification of criteria deemed to be appropriate, the teacher is then assessed against this ‘ideal profile’. It is the author’s view that the teacher should be perceived as a professional, capable of undertaking his task with autonomy. This is particularly valuable if a mechanism exists to assist him in identifying his strengths and weaknesses so that he can capitalise on the former whilst endeavouring to eradicate the latter (through the application of appropriate staff development). Thus, in 1975, as part of a doctoral research project, the author devised a teaching appraisal system which became know as TARGET. TARGET is an acronym for Teaching Appraisal by Repertory Grid Elicitation Techniques and is based on the principles of Personal Construct Psychology. The primary objective when using the TARGET system is to raise the perceptual awareness of the teacher to his strengths and weaknesses, this, in turn, may enable him to become more effective at this job. However, the system remains far less threatening than those aforementioned behavioural techniques. Since 1975, the author has continued his research and whilst TARGET has been, and is still, used in a number of institutions of further and higher education in the UK, USA, Australia and even India, the methodology developed has been refined and improved over the intervening period. Consequently, the technique now proposed by the author as the most efficient way of raising perceptual awareness (and thus achieving the same goals as the TARGET system), is to encourage individual lecturers to sit in front of a small microprocessor and interact with a programme, (designed using the same principles of Personal Construct Psychology), such that feedback can be given immediately in terms of his strengths and weaknesses. This paper briefly considers the TARGET system as it was devised, the interactive computer programme as it is currently used at Garnett College, (and some other institutions in Europe and Australia) and finally, illustrates the principles underlying both the TARGET and interactive computer programme by describing the game of MISUNDERSTOOD, which can be played without the hardwear support, of the video or computing kind, necessary in both the former methods. MISUNDERSTOOD can be played in groups of three or four (with a number of groups playing simultaneously) as a one-off staff development exercise. It has already been successfully used by an international motor company, a number of educational institutions and the Prison Education Officers Training Scheme. The author contends therefore, that raising perceptual awareness by any of the three methods described in this paper makes a positive and worthwhile contribution to the improvement of the effectiveness of the FE teacher, and supports this with evidence drawn from his experience of applying the techniques in a number of institutions in which he has been employed and had some responsibility for Staff Development. © 1981, The Vocational Aspect of Education Ltd.",doi,10.1080/10408347308001561,Scopus,Vocational Aspect of Education,Keen T.R.,1981,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Real Time Emotion Detection Within A Wireless Sensor Network And Its Impact On Power Consumption,"Recent advances in portable and wearable electroencephalograph (EEG) devices has raised the need to detect emotions in real time for applications such as wellbeing monitoring, gaming and social networking. A number of researchers have reported real time emotion detection systems implemented on a computer. This study advances these efforts by implementing a real time emotion detection system on a wirelesses sensor node with minimal hardware resources (256 kb of flash memory and 16 MHz processing speed) suitable for integration in a wearable wireless sensor node. The experimental results demonstrate that detecting emotions within the sensor node using suitable algorithms prolong the battery life by 5 days (38%) and by 39 days at an emotion detection rate of 2 and 60 s, respectively, as compared with transmitting the raw EEG data wirelessly. This also reduces the length of packets transmitted which directly minimises the packet error rate and the power that would be consumed because of retransmission of these erroneous packets. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2014.",doi,10.1049/iet-wss.2014.0056,Scopus,IET Wireless Sensor Systems,"Matiko J.W., Beeby S.P., Tudor J.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Reappraising The Ultimatum: An Fmri Study Of Emotion Regulation And Decision Making,"Emotion regulation strategies provide a means by which to modulate our social behavior. In this study, we investigated the effect of using reappraisal to both up- And downregulate social decision making. After being instructed on how to use reappraisal, participants played the Ultimatum Game while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging and applied the strategies of upregulation (reappraising the proposer's intentions as more negative), down-regulation (reappraising the proposer's intentions as less negative), as well as a baseline ""look"" condition. As hypothesized, when reappraising, decision acceptance rates were altered, with a greater number of unfair offers accepted while down-regulating and a greater number of unfair offers rejected while upregulating, both relative to the baseline condition. At the neural level, during reappraisal, significant activations were observed in the inferior and middle frontal gyrus (MFG), in addition to the medial prefrontal cortex and cingulate gyrus for unfair offers only. Regulated decisions involved left inferior frontal gyrus for upregulation and MFG for down-regulation strategies, respectively. Importantly, the effects of emotion modulation were evident in posterior insula, with less activation for down-regulation and more activation for upregulation in these areas. Notably, we show for the first time that top-down strategies such as reappraisal strongly affect our socioeconomic decisions. © The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press.

,"Recognizing The Face Of Johnny, Suzy, And Me: Insensitivity To The Spacing Among Features At 4 Years Of Age","Four-year-olds were tested for their ability to use differences in the spacing among features to recognize familiar faces. They were given a storybook depicting multiple views of 2 children. They returned to the laboratory 2 weeks later and used a ""magic wand"" to play a computer game that tested their ability to recognize the familiarized faces and their own face based on the spacing of features. Children performed at chance levels. Follow-up studies confirmed that they had attended to internal facial features and validated the stimuli. The results contrast with studies showing some sensitivity to the spacing of features in infants and preschool children; multiple mechanisms of face processing may make use of spatial relations and develop at different rates. © 2006 by the Society for Research in Child Development, Inc.

,Rehabilitation Following Cerebral Anoxia: An Assessment Of 27 Patients,"Objectives: (1) To evaluate cognitive and emotional impairments, disability and quality-of-life for adults with cerebral anoxia institutionalized in residential care facilities. (2) To evaluate the efficacy of medication, psychotherapy, support group and therapeutic activities.Methods: Twenty-seven persons with cerebral anoxia were recruited, on average 8 years post-injury. Only 20 went through the whole study. Over three consecutive 2-month periods, they were assessed four times to evaluate: baseline observations (T1-T2), adjustment of their medication (T2-T3); and the effect of psychotherapy, support group and therapeutic activities such as physical and artistic or cultural activities usually proposed in the facilities involved (T3-T4). Examined variables at all time points were cognitive status, anxiety and depression, anosognosia, alexithymia, disability and quality-of-life.Results: All participants exhibited cognitive and emotional impairments comparable to those reported in the literature. Statistical analyses revealed good baseline stability of their condition and no significant effects of changes in medication (between T2 and T3). Conversely, following implementation of psychotherapy, support group and therapeutic activities (between T3 and T4), quality-of-life and social participation were significantly improved.Conclusion: Social participation and quality-of-life for persons instutionalized several years after cerebral anoxia were improved by psychotherapeutic and therapeutic activities. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",doi,10.3109/02699052.2015.1113563,Scopus,Brain Injury,"Tazopoulou E., Miljkovitch R., Truelle J.-L., Schnitzler A., Onillon M., Zucco T., Hawthorne G., Montreuil M.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Relation Of Self-Rated Measures Of Physical Activity To Multiple Risk Factors Of Insulin Resistance Syndrome In Young Adults: The Bogalusa Heart Study,"The relation of self-rated measures of physical activity to multiple risk factors of insulin resistance syndrome (IRS) was examined in African American (n = 409) and white (n = 1,011) young adults aged 20 to 38 years enrolled in the Bogalusa Heart Study. Physical activity was assessed in terms of work activity, leisure-time activity, television watching, and video game playing by a questionnaire. Waist circumference, blood pressure, total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio, and insulin resistance index showed a consistent inverse trend with leisure-time activity (P < 0.01) and a positive trend with hours of inactivity (P < 0.01) after adjusting for age, race, and sex. An inverse relationship was seen between leisure-time activity and mean number of risk factors (>75th percentile for age, race, and sex) (P < 0.001), whereas a positive relationship was seen with hours of inactivity (P < 0.001). Moderately to very active individuals versus inactive individuals had a reduced relative risk of having ≥3 risk factors (P < 0.05); conversely, excess hours of inactivity increased the relative risk (P < 0.05). Thus, leisure-time activity and hours of inactivity are important predictors of multiple cardiovascular risk variables of IRS in young adults. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

,Relationship Between A Range Of Sedentary Behaviours And Blood Pressure During Early Adolescence,"Very few studies have explored links between physical activity, sedentary behaviours and blood pressure (BP) in early adolescence. We aimed to assess the association between a range of sedentary activities (screen time, television (TV) viewing, computer usage, video game usage and time spent in homework or reading) and BP in schoolchildren. Eligible year-7 students (2353/3144, mean age 12.7 years) from a random cluster sample of 21 Sydney schools were examined during 2003-2005. Parents and children completed detailed questionnaires of activity. BP was measured using a standard protocol and high BP was defined using published guidelines. Height and weight were measured, and body mass index (BMI) calculated. After adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, parental education, height, BMI and time spent in physical activity, each hour per day spent in screen time, watching TV and playing video games was associated with a significant increase in diastolic BP of 0.44 (P0.0001), 0.99 (P0.0001) and 0.64 mm Hg (P0.04), respectively. In contrast, each hour per day spent reading was associated with a decrease of 0.91 (P0.01) and 0.69 mm Hg (P0.02) in systolic and diastolic BP, respectively. Our results indicate that addressing different types of sedentary activities could be a potentially important strategy to reduce the prevalence of elevated BP in children. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",doi,10.1038/jhh.2011.40,Scopus,Journal of Human Hypertension,"Gopinath B., Baur L.A., Hardy L.L., Kifley A., Rose K.A., Wong T.Y., Mitchell P.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Reliability And Validity Of Portable Blood Pressure/Pulse Units During A Competitive Challenge,"The aim of the present study was to determine the reliability and validity of recordings from three portable blood pressure/pulse units compared with simultaneous recordings from a polygraph used as the standard for these comparisons. The units tested included the Sears Digital Z153, Industrial Biomedical Sensor (IBS) Digital SD-700, and the Sphygmostat B-350/PU-102 (analog scale). Thirty healthy subjects were exposed to Pac-Man video game and mental arithmetic stressors. Each stressor was preceded by relaxation and followed by recovery periods. During each period, systolic/diastolic blood pressure and pulse were taken from one of the three portable units and the polygraph. The three units were reliable in recording systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate across baseline, stressor, and recovery periods. The blood pressure/pulse readings from the digital units by Sears and IBS corresponded more closely to simultaneous polygraph recordings than did the analog scale device by Sphygmostat. These results suggest that the digital blood pressure/pulse units employed in this investigation are reliable and valid measurement devices suitable for field research with clinical populations. © 1985 Psychonomic Society, Inc.",doi,10.3758/BF03214447,Scopus,"Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, & Computers","Follick M.J., Ahern D.K., Gorkin L.",1985,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Repeated Exposure To Video Game Play Results In Decreased Blood Pressure Responding,"Repeated exposure to violent media is related to negative outcomes, including aggression, hostility, and cognitive and social deficits. We examined if cardiovascular and emotional responding to video game play changed across 3 weekly sessions. Participants were 41 adolescents (M age = 14.8; male = 29; female = 12) from rural Appalachia. Participants attended 3 weekly sessions and played 1 of 3 video games (basketball, fighting, or horror) each time. Measures included heart rate (HR); systolic blood pressure (SBP); diastolic blood pressure (DBP); self-reported aggression, anger, and reactions to game play; and history of video game play. Resting and posttést cardiovascular measures did not differ from session to session. Adolescents displayed HR and SBP reactivity to game play within each session. They also demonstrated decreased SBP and DBP responding to video game play across the 3-week period, regardless of game content. Affective responses did not change significantly across the course of the experiment. Adolescents who played the violent games reported more frustration and arousal than those who played the sports game. The implications of these findings are discussed.

,Resilient Help To Switch And Overlap Hierarchical Subsystems In A Small Human Group,"Groups of social organisms in nature are resilient systems that can overcome unpredicted threats by helping its members. These social organisms are assumed to behave both autonomously and cooperatively as individuals, the helper, the helped and other part of a group depending on the context such as emergencies. However, the structure and function of these resilient actions, such as how helpers help colleagues and how the helper's action is effective at multiple subsystem scales remain unclear. Here we investigated the behaviour of organised and efficient small human groups in a ballgame defence, and identified three principles of hierarchical resilient help when under attack. First, at a present high emergency level, the helper simply switched the local roles in the attacked subsystem with the helped. Second, at an intermediate emergency level, the helpers effectively acted in overlapping subsystems. Third, for the most critical emergency, the helpers globally switched the action on the overall system. These resilient actions to the benefit of the system were assumed to be observed in only humans, which help colleagues at flexibly switched and overlapped hierarchical subsystem. We suggest that these multi-layered helping behaviours can help to understand resilient cooperation in social organisms and human groups.",doi,10.1038/srep23911,Scopus,Scientific Reports,"Fujii K., Yokoyama K., Koyama T., Rikukawa A., Yamada H., Yamamoto Y.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Respiratory Effects On Experimental Heat Pain And Cardiac Activity,"Objective. Slow deep breathing has been proposed as an effective method to decrease pain. However, experimental studies conducted to validate this claim have not been carried out. Design. We measured thermal pain threshold and tolerance scores from 20 healthy adults during five different conditions, namely, during natural breathing (baseline), slow deep breathing (6 breaths/minute), rapid breathing (16 breaths/minute), distraction (video game), and heart rate (HR) biofeedback. We measured respiration (rate and depth) and HR variability from the electrocardiogram (ECG) output and analyzed the effects of respiration on pain and HR variability using time and frequency domain measures of the ECG. Results. Compared with baseline, thermal pain threshold was significantly higher during slow deep breathing (P = 0.002), HR biofeedback (P < 0.001), and distraction (P = 0.006), whereas thermal pain tolerance was significantly higher during slow deep breathing (P = 0.003) and HR biofeedback (P < 0.001). Compared with baseline, only slow deep breathing and HR biofeedback conditions had an effect on cardiac activity. These conditions increased the amplitude of vagal cardiac markers (peak-to-valley, P < 0.001) as well as low frequency power (P < 0.001). Conclusion. Slow deep breathing and HR biofeedback had analgesic effects and increased vagal cardiac activity. Distraction also produced analgesia; however, these effects were not accompanied by concomitant changes in cardiac activity. This suggests that the neurobiology underlying respiratory-induced analgesia and distraction are different. Clinical implications are discussed, as are the possible cardiorespiratory processes responsible for mediating breathing-induced analgesia. © American Academy of Pain Medicine.",doi,10.1111/j.1526-4637.2009.00681.x,Scopus,Pain Medicine,"Chalaye P., Goffaux P., Lafrenaye S., Marchand S.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Review Of Semantic-Free Utterances In Social Human–Robot Interaction,"As a young and emerging field in social human–robot interaction (HRI), semantic-free utterances (SFUs) research has been receiving attention over the last decade. SFUs are an auditory interaction means for machines that allow emotion and intent expression, which are composed of vocalizations and sounds without semantic content or language dependence. Currently, SFUs are most commonly utilized in animation movies (e.g., R2-D2, WALL-E, Despicable Me), cartoons (e.g., “Teletubbies,” “Morph,” “La Linea”), and computer games (e.g., The Sims) and hold significant potential for applications in HRI. SFUs are categorized under four general types: Gibberish Speech (GS), Non-Linguistic Utterances (NLUs), Musical Utterances (MU), and Paralinguistic Utterances (PU). By introducing the concept of SFUs and bringing multiple sets of studies in social HRI that have never been analyzed jointly before, this article addresses the need for a comprehensive study of the existing literature for SFUs. It outlines the current grand challenges, open questions, and provides guidelines for future researchers considering to utilize SFU in social HRI.

,Revisiting Gender Preference For A First-Person Shooter Videogame: Effects Of Non-Verbal Sensitivity And Gender On Enjoyment,"In this study, we investigated the effects of gender (male vs. female) and non-verbal sensitivity (high vs. low) on game experience after playing a first-person shooter videogame. The results of Experiment 2 (n = 50) showed that participants with high non-verbal sensitivity experienced more positive valence and a greater level of arousal than participants with low non-verbal sensitivity. The biological sex of the participants became non-significant, after taking into consideration non-verbal sensitivity. The results of a mediation analysis showed that the emotional valence and arousal mediated the effects of non-verbal sensitivity on the enjoyment of the videogame. Implications with respect to a new understanding of gender preference for certain genres of videogames by identifying specific gender-related skills are discussed. © The Author 2014.",doi,10.1093/iwc/iwu024,Scopus,Interacting with Computers,"Jung Y., Oh H.J., Sng J., Kwon J.H., Detenber B.H.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Role Of Adolescent Female Volleyball Players' Psychophysiological Properties And Body Build In Performance Of Different Elements Of The Game.,"Body-build peculiarities (49 body measurements) and psychophysiological properties (21 computerized tests) of 32 adolescent female volleyballers were studied to assess their significance in performance at competitions. Games were recorded by the original computer program Game, and an index of proficiency representative elements of the game was calculated for each player. Regression analysis was applied to predict the best psychophysiological and anthropometric models for serve, reception, block, feint, and attack. Seven tests of psychophysiological indices and 14 anthropometric variables explained 38-98% and 32-83% of skill performance, respectively. Consequently, to improve young volleyball players' performance, everyday coaching should be complemented by detailed assessment of their body build and psychophysiological characteristics.",doi,10.2466/pms.101.1.108-120,pubmed,Perceptual and motor skills,"Stamm, Raini; Stamm, Meelis; Thomson, Kaivo",2006,NA,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Screen-Viewing And The Home Tv Environment: The European Youth Heart Study,"Objective: Examine if home environmental factors are associated with screen-viewing. Methods: Data are for 2670, 3rd and 9th grade participants in Denmark, Portugal, Estonia and Norway collected between 1997 and 2000. Outcomes were spending > 2 h after-school watching television (TV) and > 1 h per day playing computer games. Child Autonomy and the home TV Environment were exposures. Results: Each unit increase in Child Autonomy was associated with 9% increase in risk of watching more than 2 h of TV per day after school and a 19% increase in risk of spending more than an hour per day playing computer games. TV Environment was associated with a 31% per unit increase in risk of watching > 2 h of TV after school and 11% increase in risk of spending > 1 h playing computer games. Conclusions: A family environment in which after-school TV viewing is part of the home culture and homes where children have more autonomy over their own behavior are associated with an increased risk of watching > 2 h of TV per day after school and spending more > 1 h per day playing computer games. The home screen-viewing environment and Child Autonomy may be malleable targets for changing screen-viewing. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

,Selective Cardiovascular Effects Of Stress And Cigarette Smoking,"The purpose of the present study was to determine how cigarette smoking and psychological stress combine to affect cardiovascular function. Stress was operationally defined as playing a series of difficult video games under challenging instructional conditions. Following an initial test game, 51 smokers were randomly assigned to a 2 (smoke vs. sham smoke) x 2 (stress vs. no stress) design. The results showed that the subjects who sham smoked (inhaled unlit cigarettes) under no stress evidenced minimal changes in cardiovascular parameters. Subjects who smoked under no stress evidenced approximately 12 mmHg increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and 9 mmHg increases in diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and a 15 beat-per-minute increase in heart rate (HR). These effects were similar in magnitude to those seen in subjects who sham smoked under stress. By contrast, subjects who smoked under stress showed markedly larger increases in all cardiovascular parameters, approximately doubling the magnitude of the observed response over that seen with either smoking or stress alone. Correlational analyses suggested the presence of stable individual differences in autonomic lability or sensitivity. Possible mechanisms are suggested whereby stress and smoking may combine to heighten the risk for coronary disease. © 1983 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",doi,10.1080/0097840X.1983.9936125,Scopus,Journal of Human Stress,"Macdougall J.M., Dembroski T.M., Slaats S., Herd J.A., Eliot R.S.",1983,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Self-Emergence Of A Common Lexicon By Evolution In Teams Of Autonomous Agents,"In multi-agent systems, the study of language and communication is an active field of research. In this paper we present the application of evolutionary strategies to the self-emergence of a common lexicon in a population of agents. By modeling the vocabulary or lexicon of each agent as an association matrix or look-up table that maps the meanings (i.e. the objects encountered by the agents or the states of the environment itself) into symbols or signals we check whether it is possible for the population to converge in an autonomous, decentralized way to a common lexicon, so that the communication efficiency of the entire population is optimal. We have conducted several experiments aimed at testing whether it is possible to converge with evolutionary strategies to an optimal Saussurean communication system. We have organized our experiments alongside two main lines: first, we have investigated the effect of the population size on the convergence results. Second, and foremost, we have also investigated the effect of the lexicon size on the convergence results. To analyze the convergence of the population of agents we have defined the population's consensus when all the agents (i.e. 100% of the population) share the same association matrix or lexicon. As a general conclusion we have shown that evolutionary strategies are powerful enough optimizers to guarantee the convergence to lexicon consensus in a population of autonomous agents. © 2011 Elsevier B.V..",doi,10.1016/j.neucom.2011.01.026,Scopus,Neurocomputing,"Maravall D., De Lope J., Domínguez R.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Setting The Scene: Playing Digital Director In Interactive Storytelling And Creation,"Interactive digital storytelling promises to be a new artistic discipline. But what does the artwork look like? And how much control does the artist have over the final result? By searching for the right answers, we draw several approaches from diverse fields such as filmmaking, game design, autonomous agents, psychology, and narrative intelligence. We first give a definition of interactive storytelling that includes a scope between authorship and emergent narrative, and present two example projects with different emphases. Then, we introduce a multi-level concept for an experimental stage that can be used to explore interactive storytelling at varying degrees of flexibility versus predetermination. Instead of inventing the ultimate virtual narrator, we suggest developing layers of run-time engines that allow authors to work with directions on each single layer separately - from selecting high-level dramatic structures down to directing animated actors. The concept of underlying models at each level is explained in detail by the example of a story model implementation. Further, we show variations of level adjustments causing graded degrees of semi-autonomy. First results of this experimental stage are presented, and the primary future tasks are pointed out. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.",doi,10.1016/S0097-8493(01)00176-5,Scopus,Computers and Graphics (Pergamon),"Spierling U., Grasbon D., Braun N., Iurgel I.",2002,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Short Review On Quantum Key Distribution Protocols.,"Cryptographic protocols and mechanisms are widely investigated under the notion of quantum computing. Quantum cryptography offers particular advantages over classical ones, whereas in some cases established protocols have to be revisited in order to maintain their functionality. The purpose of this paper is to provide the basic definitions and review the most important theoretical advancements concerning the BB84 and E91 protocols. It also aims to offer a summary on some key developments on the field of quantum key distribution, closely related with the two aforementioned protocols. The main goal of this study is to provide the necessary background information along with a thorough review on the theoretical aspects of QKD, concentrating on specific protocols. The BB84 and E91 protocols have been chosen because most other protocols are similar to these, a fact that makes them important for the general understanding of how the QKD mechanism functions.",doi,10.1007/978-3-319-56246-9_12,pubmed,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,"Giampouris, Dimitris",2017,NA,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Small Robot Agents With On-Board Vision And Local Intelligence,"We designed a family of completely autonomous mobile robots with local intelligence. We developed a controller with a variety of digital and analog I/O facilities and the operating system RoBIOS, whichallows maximum flexibility. The robots have a number of on-board sensors, including vision, and do not rely on global sensor systems. The on-board computing power is sufficient to analyze several colorimages per second. This enables the robots to perform several different task such as navigation, map generation or intelligent group behavior and does not limit them to the game of robot soccer. © 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",doi,10.1163/156855300741438,Scopus,Advanced Robotics,"Bräunl T., Graf B.",2e3,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Social Economic Decision-Making Across The Lifespan: An Fmri Investigation,"Recent research in neuroeconomics suggests that social economic decision-making may be best understood as a dual-systems process, integrating the influence of deliberative and affective subsystems. However, most of this research has focused on young adults and it remains unclear whether our current models extend to healthy aging. To address this question, we investigated the behavioral and neural basis of simple economic decisions in 18 young and 20 older healthy adults. Participants made decisions which involved accepting or rejecting monetary offers from human and non-human (computer) partners in an Ultimatum Game, while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The partners' proposals involved splitting an amount of money between the two players, and ranged from $1 to $5 (from a $10 pot). Relative to young adults, older participants expected more equitable offers and rejected moderately unfair offers ($3) to a larger extent. Imaging results revealed that, relative to young participants, older adults had higher activations in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) when receiving unfair offers ($1-$3). Age group moderated the relationship between left DLPFC activation and acceptance rates of unfair offers. In contrast, older adults showed lower activation of bilateral anterior insula in response to unfair offers. No age group difference was observed when participants received fair ($5) offers. These findings suggest that healthy aging may be associated with a stronger reliance on computational areas subserving goal maintenance and rule shifting (DLPFC) during interactive economic decision-making. Consistent with a well-documented "" positivity effect"" , older age may also decrease recruitment of areas involved in emotion processing and integration (anterior insula) in the face of social norm violation. © 2012.",doi,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2012.02.026,Scopus,Neuropsychologia,"Harlé Katia M.

,Social Foraging Theory For Robust Multiagent System Design,"An analogy between an agent (e.g., an autonomous vehicle) and a biological forager is extended to a social environment by viewing a communication network as implementing interagent sociality. We first describe engineering design within an evolutionary game-theoretic framework. We then explain why sociality may emerge in some environments and for some agent objectives. Next, we derive the evolutionarily stable design strategy for an agent manufacturer: 1) choosing whether the agent it produces should cooperate with other agents in a search problem and 2) choosing the group size of a multiagent system tasked with a cooperative search problem. We show the impact of ""agent relatedness,"" a measure of common descent between two agents based on their underlying manufacturers, on the choices in scenarios 1) and 2). Our predictions are evaluated in an autonomous vehicle simulation testbed. The results illustrate a new methodology for manufacturers to make robust, optimal choices for multiagent system design for a given set of objectives and domain of operation. Note to Practitioners - The design of autonomous multirobot systems with various applications, such as in parts production or search and destroy operations in a military environment, is of growing importance. Here, we integrate economic and technical issues into an unified engineering design framework for the manufacturers of robots. Our approach leads to manufacturer design decisions that are robust relative to the market for a manufacturer's products. Robot component aspects, such as sensors and communications as well as mission performance aspects, can be captured and coupled into the design process. We use the design of intervehicle cooperation and robot group size to illustrate this approach. The practical significance lies in the fact that we take a broad perspective on engineering design, one closer to the real world, due to the considerations of market-place economics. Moreover, the approach provides a framework to study design choices that escape systematic analysis in other frameworks (e.g., group size). © 2007 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TASE.2006.872124,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,"Andrews B.W., Passino K.M., Waite T.A.",2007,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Social Media Versus Gaming Associations With Typical And Recent Dreams,"Cirucci (2013a) hypothesized that video game players would display similarities to social media users and that this relationship should be examined. This inquiry compared university students who varied in the degree to which they use social media (SMU) and play video games (VGP) on several dream indices and 1 personality inventory. Dreams have been shown to be continuous with waking mentation (Schredl, 2003) and to regulate negative emotions (Levin & Nielsen, 2009). Thus, they may offer a relatively unobstrusive measure of reactions to media use. Although there were meaningful differences between the 4 groups (high VGP/high SMU; high VGP/low SMU; low VGP/high SMU; low VGP/low SMU), most analysis resulted in no differences in dreams. Differences seemed to support the nightmare protection thesis of video game play such that high-end gamers, no matter the degree of social media use, suffered less from these negative types of dreams. Additionally, the high VGP/high SMU group had the thinnest psychological boundaries and thus were perhaps most susceptible to media effects. While at the same time this group of high-end media users showed the least negative self concepts in their recent dream content. This was reflected in their typical dream reports as well. © 2014 American Psychological Association.",doi,10.1037/a0037616,Scopus,Dreaming,"Gackenbach J., Boyes A.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Socio-Demographic Differences In Parental Monitoring Of Children In Late Childhood And Adolescents’ Screen-Based Media Use,"According to a social cognitive theory, children may learn to function through processes of modeling and observational learning, with parents and the media being the significant sources of socialization and learning in the home environment. Adolescence is a period when children progressively look for autonomy and independence. One of the important research questions is whether adolescents utilize screen-based media with or without parental monitoring and limit-setting. This exploratory study examines socio-demographic factors associated with parenting (i.e., co-using, limit setting on the amount, limit setting on contents, and active mediation) in regards to television and video game usage during adolescence. Participants were 799 adolescents (5th to 12th graders) and their parents. Results indicate no gender differences in parental monitoring, but age/grade differences were found with less parental monitoring (more autonomy or independence) of older children. Parental monitoring also differed by ethnicity and by household income. Asian parents were the most restrictive while Hispanic parents were the least restrictive. Parents also reported more active mediation or engagement in families with higher household income. Findings initiate consideration of parenting styles in adolescent media usage, which have implications for adolescent adjustment and developmental outcomes. © 2016 Broadcast Education Association.",doi,10.1080/08838151.2016.1164168,Scopus,Journal of Broadcasting and Electronic Media,Top N.,2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Speeding Up Multiagent Reinforcement Learning By Coarse-Graining Of Perception: The Hunter Game,"Reinforcement learning is a promising technique for making agents learn to cooperate in the real world. When we try to apply the technique to a practical problem, however, the slowness of learning due to the increased number of states becomes a bottleneck. We try to speed up learning by reducing the effective number of states by coarse-graining of perceptions at the early stage of learning, and at the same time try to ensure the overall performance by switching back to complete perception later. By only switching the perception granularity, however, it is difficult to rectify bad habits acquired at the early stage of learning. Hence, we make a coarse-grained perception learner and a complete perception learner work in parallel, and switch the learner used for action selection at appropriate time. This technique makes possible both fast early-stage learning and overall good performance.",doi,10.1002/ecjb.1078,Scopus,"Electronics and Communications in Japan, Part II: Electronics (English translation of Denshi Tsushin Gakkai Ronbunshi)","Ito A., Kanabuchi M.",2001,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali

,Stimulus Specificity But No Dishabituation Of Sensory-Specific Satiety,"Sensory-specific satiety (SSS) refers to the decrease of pleasure derived from a food with its consumption. In the current study it was examined whether SSS for a specific food can be dishabituated. To this end a total of 40 participants (10 males) received bite sized portions of a test food to repeatedly consume. This typically renders SSS for that food. After such established SSS, the participants ate a different test food repeatedly during a period of 10. min or played a computer game (i.e., Tetris), depending on the experimental condition. It was expected that the consumption of another food would induce dishabituation of SSS for the original test food. The participants indeed demonstrated SSS to the test food, but irrespective of condition this SSS proved stable. It is concluded that SSS is stimulus (i.e., food) specific but not subject to dishabituation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.appet.2012.02.009,Scopus,Appetite,Havermans R.C.,2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Stochastic Payoff Evaluation Increases The Temperature Of Selection,"We study stochastic evolutionary game dynamics in populations of finite size. Moreover, each individual has a randomly distributed number of interactions with other individuals. Therefore, the payoff of two individuals using the same strategy can be different. The resulting ""payoff stochasticity"" reduces the intensity of selection and therefore increases the temperature of selection. A simple mean-field approximation is derived that captures the average effect of the payoff stochasticity. Correction terms to the mean-field theory are computed and discussed. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

,"Study Protocol Of The Internet User Cohort For Unbiased Recognition Of Gaming Disorder In Early Adolescence (Icure), Korea, 2015-2019","Introduction In 2013, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) proposed nine internet gaming disorder (IGD) diagnostic criteria as a condition warranting further empirical and clinical research. The aim of this study is to clarify the natural and clinical courses of IGD proposed DSM-5 in adolescents and to evaluate its risk and protective factors. Methods and analysis The Internet user Cohort for Unbiased Recognition of gaming disorder in Early Adolescence (iCURE) study is an ongoing multidisciplinary, prospective, longitudinal cohort study conducted in 21 schools in Korea. Participant recruitment commenced in March 2015 with the goal of registering 3000 adolescents. The baseline assessment included surveys on emotional, social and environmental characteristics. A parent or guardian completed questionnaires and a structured psychiatric comorbidity diagnostic interview regarding their children. Adolescents with the Internet Game Use-Elicited Symptom Screen total scores of 6 or higher were asked to participate in the clinical diagnostic interview. Two subcohorts of adolescents were constructed: a representative subcohort and a clinical evaluation subcohort. The representative subcohort comprises a randomly selected 10% of the iCURE to investigate the clinical course of IGD based on clinical diagnosis and to estimate the false negative rate. The clinical evaluation subcohort comprised participants meeting three or more of the nine IGD criteria, determined by clinical diagnostic interview, to show the clinical course of IGD. Follow-up data will be collected annually for the 3 years following the baseline assessments. The primary endpoint is 2-year incidence, remission and recurrence rates of IGD. Cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between exposures and outcomes as well as mediation factors will be evaluated.

,Supervisory Control Of Multiple Robots In Dynamic Tasking Environments,"A military targeting environment was simulated to examine the effects of an intelligent route-planning agent RoboLeader, which could support dynamic robot re-tasking based on battlefield developments, on the performance of robotics operators. We manipulated the level of assistance (LOAs) provided by RoboLeader as well as the presence of a visualisation tool that provided feedback to the participants on their primary task (target encapsulation) performance. Results showed that the participants' primary task benefited from RoboLeader on all LOAs conditions compared to manual performance; however, visualisation had little effect. Frequent video gamers demonstrated significantly better situation awareness of the mission environment than did infrequent gamers. Those participants with higher spatial ability performed better on a secondary target detection task than did those with lower spatial ability. Finally, participants' workload assessments were significantly lower when they were assisted by RoboLeader than when they performed the target entrapment task manually.Practitioner Summary: This study demonstrated the utility of an intelligent agent for enhancing robotics operators' supervisory control performance as well as reducing their workload during a complex urban scenario involving moving targets. The results furthered the understanding of the interplay among level-of-autonomy, multitasking performance and individual differences in military tasking environments. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",doi,10.1080/00140139.2012.689013,Scopus,Ergonomics,"Chen J.Y.C., Barnes M.J.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Support For The Predictive Validity Of The Sasc-R: Linkages With Reactions To An In Vivo Peer Evaluation Manipulation,"The present study examined the predictive validity of the Social Anxiety Scale for Children-Revised (SASC-R) by investigating associations between children's social anxiety symptoms and their cognitive and behavioral reactions in response to an in vivo peer evaluation manipulation. Participants (N = 115) ages 10-13, played a computer game based on the television show Survivor and were randomized to either a peer rejection (i.e., receiving the lowest total 'likeability' score from a group of peer-judges), a peer success (i.e., receiving the highest score), or a neutral peer feedback condition. Children reporting higher levels of social anxiety displayed more negative game-relevant performance expectations as well as more negative cognitive evaluations of both success and failure feedback. Moreover, regardless of feedback valence, children scoring higher on social anxiety reported greater reluctance to engage in game-related social activities. These findings provide support for the predictive validity of the SASC-R. © 2007.",doi,10.1016/j.janxdis.2006.10.007,Scopus,Journal of Anxiety Disorders,"Reijntjes A., Dekovic M., Telch M.J.",2007,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Systems Thinking And Organizational Learning: Acting Locally And Thinking Globally In The Organization Of The Future,"To learn more rapidly and increase flexibility in a world of growing complexity and change, firms are experimenting with new modes of organization, new reward systems, and less authoritarian values - for example, reducing hierarchy, increasing local decision-making responsibility and individual incentives, and rewarding innovation. But local decision making and individual autonomy lead to management anarchy unless managers account for the interconnections and long-term side-effects of their local decisions. Laudable goals such as 'empowering' and 'enabling' individuals often prove counterproductive unless managers can act locally and think globally. Managers must become 'systems thinkers' as well as better learners. This paper reports on one approach to these issues: forming collaborative action research partnerships with corporations to 1) develop new tools to accelerate learning, and 2) test those tools in real organizations where managers face pressing issues. We argue that simulation is an important element of successful learning laboratories to develop systems thinking and promote organizational learning. A case study focused on improving quality and total cost performance in the insurance industry is presented to illustrate how these tools can both produce insight and focus change. © 1992.",doi,10.1016/0377-2217(92)90011-W,Scopus,European Journal of Operational Research,"Senge P.M., Sterman J.D.",1992,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Taking Action In The Face Of Threat: Neural Synchronization Predicts Adaptive Coping,"The ability to take action in the face of threat is highly diverse across individuals. What are the neural processes that determine individual differences in the ability to cope with danger? We hypothesized that the extent of synchronization between amygdala, striatum, and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) would predict successful active coping performance. To test this, we developed a novel computer task based on the principals of Sidman avoidance. Healthy human participants learned through trial and error to move a marker between virtual game board compartments once every 3 s to avoid mild shocks. Behaviorally, participants exhibited large individual differences. Strikingly, both amygdala-mPFC and caudate-mPFC coupling during active coping trials covaried with final active coping performance across participants. These findings indicate that synchronization between mPFC subregions, and both amygdala and caudate predicts whether individuals will achieve successful active coping performance by the end of training. Thus, successful performance of adaptive actions in the face of threat requires functional synchronization of a neural circuit consisting of mPFC, striatum, and amygdala. Malfunction in the crosstalk between these components might underlie anxiety symptoms and impair individuals’ ability to actively cope under stress. This opens an array of possibilities for therapeutic targets for fear and anxiety disorders. © 2014 the authors.",doi,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2152-14.2014,Scopus,Journal of Neuroscience,"Collins K.A., Mendelsohn A., Cain C.K., Schiller D.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Taking Fun Seriously: Using Cognitive Models To Reason About Interaction With Computer Games,This paper seeks to extend the application of techniques from affective psychology to show how cognitive models can be used to represent and reason about interaction with computer games. It is argued that this modelling activity provides insights into the motivational appeal that often distinguishes computer games from other forms of human computer interaction. The long-term aim behind this research is to use our improved understanding of interaction with computer games to inform the subsequent development of more general classes of interactive systems. Barnard's Interacting Cognitive Subsystems (ICS) is used throughout this paper. This decision is justified by the fact that ICS has already been applied to analyse the negative emotions surrounding clinical depression. This previous work provides a useful starting point for our investigation of the more positive emotions evoked during interaction with computer games. A further justification is that ICS has also been successfully used to represent and reason about the design of human computer interfaces. © Springer-Verlag London Ltd.,doi,10.1007/BF01305335,Scopus,Personal and Ubiquitous Computing,Johnson C.,1999,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Temperature Control In Three-Network On Chips Using Task Migration,"Combination of three-dimensional (3D) IC technology and network on chip (NoC) is an effective solution to increase system scalability and also alleviate the interconnect problem in large-scale integrated circuits. However, because of the increased power density in 3D NoC systems and the destructive effect of high temperatures on chip reliability, applying thermal management solutions becomes crucial in such circuits. In this study, the authors propose a runtime distributed migration algorithm based on game theory to balance the heat dissipation among processing elements (PEs) in a 3D NoC chip multiprocessor. The objective of this algorithm is to minimise the 3D NoC system's peak temperature, as well as the overhead imposed on chip performance during migration. Owing to the high thermal correlation between adjacent PEs in the same stack in 3D NoCs, the authors model this multi-objective problem as a cooperative game. The simulation results indicate upto 23 and 27% decrease in peak temperature, for the benchmarks that have the highest communication rate and the largest number of tasks, respectively. This comes at the price of slight migration overhead in terms of power-delay product. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2013.",doi,10.1049/iet-cdt.2013.0016,Scopus,IET Computers and Digital Techniques,"Hassanpour N., Hessabi H., Hamedani P.K.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Temporal Dynamics Reveal Atypical Brain Response To Social Exclusion In Autism,"Despite significant social difficulties, children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are vulnerable to the effects of social exclusion. We recorded EEG while children with ASD and typical peers played a computerized game involving peer rejection. Children with ASD reported ostracism-related distress comparable to typically developing children. Event-related potentials (ERPs) indicated a distinct pattern of temporal processing of rejection events in children with ASD. While typically developing children showed enhanced response to rejection at a late slow wave indexing emotional arousal and regulation, those with autism showed attenuation at an early component, suggesting reduced engagement of attentional resources in the aversive social context. Results emphasize the importance of studying the time course of social information processing in ASD; they suggest distinct mechanisms subserving similar overt behavior and yield insights relevant to development and implementation of targeted treatment approaches and objective measures of response to treatment. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

,The Effect Of Online Consumer Reviews On New Product Sales,"This study examines the effect of online reviews on new product sales for consumer electronics and video games. Analyses of panel data of 332 new products from Amazon.com over nine months reveal that the valence of reviews and the volume of page views have a stronger effect on search products, whereas the volume of reviews is more important for experience products. The results also show that the volume of reviews has a significant effect on new product sales in the early period and such effect decreases over time. Moreover, the percentage of negative reviews has a greater effect than that of positive reviews, confirming the negativity bias. Thus, marketers need to consider the distinctive influences of various aspects of online reviews when launching new products and devising e-marketing strategies. Copyright © 2012 M.E. Sharpe, Inc.

,The Effect Of Playing Violent Video Games On Adolescents: Should Parents Be Quaking In Their Boots?,"Debate regarding the psychological and behavioural effects of playing violent video games has recently led to claims that violent video games increase aggression effects in adolescents, and that this issue has now been settled. However, other researchers have found either no detrimental effects from game playing or even positive (cathartic) effects. In this research we demonstrate that these different conclusions are not mutually exclusive and can be explained by the method of assessment and analytic techniques utilised. We had adolescents play a violent video game (Quake II) and took measurements of anger both before, during and after game play. The results demonstrated that some people increase, some decrease and the majority show no change in anger ratings. Unlike past research, we also demonstrate that these changes are mediated by the player's feelings immediately prior to game play and a labile temperament – one predisposed to aggression – and that these variables predict people's reactions with an average 73% concordance rate.",doi,10.1080/10683160601060655,anderson2010,"Psychology, Crime, & Law","Unsworth, G., Devilly, G.

,The Effect Of Subjective And Physiological Arousal On Dishabituation Of Salivation,"We have previously shown that salivation to the same food habituates, and recovers after presenting novel nontaste stimuli. This study assessed the effects of environmental stimuli that differentially influence subjective and autonomic arousal on dishabituation of salivation. Thirty female subjects were preloaded on a lemon yogurt milkshake and habituated to seven presentations of lemon juice. Prior to the eighth presentation of juice, subjects were presented an engaging video game designed to produce subjective but no autonomic arousal (LO), a video game plus mental arithmetic stressor, designed to produce both subjective and physiological arousal (HI), or a no stimuli (REST) control. Significant dishabituating effects of HI versus REST were shown for salivation. Heart rate was significantly higher during the dishabituator for HI than LO or REST conditions, which were equal. Finally, significant differences in arousal were shown between each of the three conditions. These results show salivation can be differentially dishabituated by nonfood stimuli, and these stimuli influence salivation without influencing subjective hunger or hedonics. © 1993.",doi,10.1016/0031-9384(93)90158-C,Scopus,Physiology and Behavior,"Epstein L.H., Mitchell S.L., Caggiula A.R.",1993,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,"The Effect Of Video Game Competition And Violence On Aggressive Behavior: Which Characteristic Has The Greatest Influence? Psychology Of Violence, 1(4), 259–274.","Objective: This study is the first to our knowledge to isolate the effect of video game violence and competitiveness on aggressive behavior. Method: In Pilot Study 1, a violent and nonviolent video game were matched on competitiveness, difficulty, and pace of action, and the effect of each game on aggressive behavior was then compared using an unambiguous measure of aggressive behavior (i.e., the Hot Sauce Paradigm) in Experiment 1. In Pilot Study 2, competitiveness was isolated by matching games on difficulty and pace of action, and systematically controlling for violence. The effect of video game competition on aggressive behavior was then examined in Experiment 2. Results: We found that video game violence was not sufficient to elevate aggressive behavior compared with a nonviolent video game, and that more competitive games produced greater levels of aggressive behavior, irrespective of the amount of violence in the games. Conclusion: It appears that competition, not violence, may be the video game characteristic that has the greatest influence on aggressive behavior. Future research is needed to explore the mechanisms through which video game competitiveness influences aggressive behavior, as well as whether this relation holds in the long-term.",doi,10.1037/a0024908,nagy2015,Psychology of Violence,"Adachi, P.

,The Effect Of Video Games On Feelings Of Aggression.,"Fueled by the media, the controversy over whether playing popular arcade/computer games increases aggressiveness has only been compounded by inconsistencies within empirical research. This experiment, conducted with university students in Scotland, was designed to explore some of these inconsistencies. Aggressiveness was manipulated as the independent variable. As dependent variables, the Buss-Durkee Hostility Inventory (Buss & Durkee, 1957) and the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ; Eysenck & Eysenck, 1975) were used. There was no linear pattern in aggressive affect change across three games that contained varying levels of violence. Results are discussed in terms of the general lack of support for the commonly held view that playing aggressive computer games causes an individual to feel more aggressive.",doi,10.1080/00223980.1995.9914952,anderson2010,Journal of Psychology,"Scott, D.",1995,NA,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,"The Effect Of Violent And Nonviolent Video Games On Heart Rate Variability, Sleep, And Emotions In Adolescents With Different Violent Gaming Habits","OBJECTIVE: To study cardiac, sleep-related, and emotional reactions to playing violent (VG) versus nonviolent video games (NVG) in adolescents with different gaming habits. METHODS: Thirty boys (aged 13-16 years, standard deviation = 0.9), half of them low-exposed (≤1 h/d) and half high-exposed (≥3 h/d) to violent games, played a VG/NVG for 2 hours during two different evenings in their homes. Heart rate (HR) and HR variability were registered from before start until next morning. A questionnaire about emotional reactions was administered after gaming sessions and a sleep diary on the following mornings. RESULTS: During sleep, there were significant interaction effects between group and gaming condition for HR (means [standard errors] for low-exposed: NVG 63.8 [2.2] and VG 67.7 [2.4]; for high-exposed: NVG 65.5 [1.9] and VG 62.7 [1.9]; F(1,28) = 9.22, p = .005). There was also a significant interaction for sleep quality (low-exposed: NVG 4.3 [0.2] and VG 3.7 [0.3]); high-exposed: NVG 4.4 [0.2] and VG 4.4 [0.2]; F(1,28) = 3.51, p = .036, one sided), and sadness after playing (low-exposed: NVG 1.0 [0.0] and VG 1.4 [0.2]; high-exposed: NVG 1.2 [0.1] and VG 1.1 [0.1]; (F(1,27) = 6.29, p = .009, one sided). CONCLUSIONS: Different combinations of the extent of (low versus high) previous VG and experimental exposure to a VG or an NVG are associated with different reaction patterns - physiologically, emotionally, and sleep related. Desensitizing effects or selection bias stand out as possible explanations.

,"The Effects Of Autonomous Difficulty Selection On Engagement, Motivation, And Learning In A Motion-Controlled Video Game Task","This experiment investigated the relationship between motivation, engagement, and learning in a video game task. Previous studies have shown increased autonomy during practice leads to superior retention of motor skills, but it is not clear why this benefit occurs. Some studies suggest this benefit arises from increased motivation during practice; others suggest the benefit arises from better information processing. Sixty novice participants were randomly assigned to a self-controlled group, who chose the progression of difficulty during practice, or to a yoked group, who experienced the same difficulty progression but did not have choice. At the end of practice, participants completed surveys measuring intrinsic motivation and engagement. One week later, participants returned for a series of retention tests at three different difficulty levels. RM-ANCOVA (controlling for pre-test) showed that the self-controlled group had improved retention compared to the yoked group, on average, β = 46.78, 95% CI = [2.68, 90.87], p = 0.04, but this difference was only statistically significant on the moderate difficulty post-test (p = 0.004). The self-controlled group also showed greater intrinsic motivation during practice, t(58) = 2.61, p = 0.01. However, there was no evidence that individual differences in engagement (p = 0.20) or motivation (p = 0.87) were associated with learning, which was the relationship this experiment was powered to detect. These data are inconsistent with strictly motivational accounts of how autonomy benefits learning, instead suggesting the benefits of autonomy may be mediated through other mechanisms. For instance, within the information processing framework, the learning benefits may emerge from learners appropriately adjusting difficulty to maintain an appropriate level of challenge (i.e., maintaining the relationship between task demands and cognitive resources). © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",doi,10.1016/j.humov.2016.08.005,Scopus,Human Movement Science,"Leiker A.M., Bruzi A.T., Miller M.W., Nelson M., Wegman R., Lohse K.R.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,"The Effects Of Risk-Glorifying Media Exposure On Risk-Positive Cognitions, Emotions, And Behaviors: A Meta-Analytic Review","In recent years, there has been a surge in the quantity of media content that glorifies risk-taking behavior, such as risky driving, extreme sports, or binge drinking. The authors conducted a meta-analysis involving more than 80,000 participants and 105 independent effect sizes to examine whether exposure to such media depictions increased their recipients' risk-taking inclinations. A positive connection was found for overall, combined risk taking (g =.41); as well as its underlying dimensions: risk-taking behaviors (g =.41), risk-positive cognitions and attitudes (g =.35), and risk-positive emotions (g =.56). This effect was observed across varying research methods (experimental, correlational, longitudinal); types of media (video games, movies, advertising, TV, music); and differing risk-related outcome measures (e.g., smoking, drinking, risky driving, sexual behavior). Multiple moderator analyses revealed 2 theoretically new boundary conditions for sociocognitive models. First, the effect was stronger for active (i.e., video games) than for passive (e.g., film, music) exposure to risk-glorifying media content. Second, the effect was stronger when there was a high degree of contextual fit between the media content and type of risk-taking measure. The theoretical, practical, and societal implications of the present research synthesis are discussed. © 2011 American Psychological Association.",doi,10.1037/a0022267,Scopus,Psychological Bulletin,"Fischer P., Greitemeyer T., Kastenmüller A., Vogrincic C., Sauer A.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,"The Effects Of Single Bouts Of Aerobic Exercise, Exergaming, And Videogame Play On Cognitive Control","Objective: The effects of single bouts of aerobic exercise, exergaming, and action videogame play on event-related brain potentials (ERPs) and task performance indices of cognitive control were investigated using a modified flanker task that manipulated demands of attentional inhibition. Methods: Participants completed four counterbalanced sessions of 20min of activity intervention (i.e., seated rest, seated videogame play, and treadmill-based and exergame-based aerobic exercise at 60% HRmax) followed by cognitive testing once heart rate (HR) returned to within 10% of pre-activity levels. Results: Results indicated decreased RT interference following treadmill exercise relative to seated rest and videogame play. P3 amplitude was increased following treadmill exercise relative to rest, suggesting an increased allocation of attentional resources during stimulus engagement. The seated videogame and exergame conditions did not differ from any other condition. Conclusions: The findings indicate that single bouts of treadmill exercise may improve cognitive control through an increase in the allocation of attentional resources and greater interference control during cognitively demanding tasks. However, similar benefits may not be derived following short bouts of aerobic exergaming or seated videogame participation. Significance: Although exergames may increase physical activity participation, they may not exert the same benefits to brain and cognition as more traditional physical activity behaviors. © 2011 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.",doi,10.1016/j.clinph.2011.01.049,Scopus,Clinical Neurophysiology,"O'Leary K.C., Pontifex M.B., Scudder M.R., Brown M.L., Hillman C.H.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,The Effects Of Time-Varying Rewards On The Evolution Of Cooperation,"Understanding how cooperative behavior emerges within a population of autonomous individuals has been the focus of a great deal of research in biology, economics and more recently in the multi-agent systems domain. However, there are still many open questions. In this paper, we address some of these questions by investigating the effects of time-varying, non-symmetric rewards on the evolution of cooperation in the spatial Prisoner's dilemma game. The rationale behind this approach is based on the notion that the associated payoffs from pursuing certain strategies do vary among members of real-world populations. In our model, agents with limited cognitive capacity play the game with their local neighbours. In addition to its game playing strategy, each agent has additional attributes that can be used to control the number of rounds of the game the agent actually participates in, as well as the magnitude of any rewards that it receives. Numerical simulations show that dynamic updates to payoff values induce a change in equilibrium cooperation levels. This suggests that heterogeneous payoff values and social diversity within a cost-benefit context are important factors in the promotion of cooperation in the spatial Prisoner's dilemma game. © Springer-Verlag 2009.",doi,10.1007/s12065-009-0032-1,Scopus,Evolutionary Intelligence,"Rezaei G., Kirley M.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,The Energy Cost Of Playing Active Video Games In Children With Obesity And Children Of A Healthy Weight,"What is already known about this subject Active video games (AVGs) are being marketed as exercise tools. AVG play can result in light-to-moderate intensity physical activity. What this study adds A comparison correcting for body size between the energy expended by children with obesity and those of a healthy weight playing AVGs. An examination of several variables related to the energy cost of AVG play including steps taken and rate of perceived exertion. There may be some differences in how children with obesity and children of a healthy weight play AVGs. Background Increasing physical activity and reducing sedentary behaviour form a large part of the treatment of paediatric obesity. However, many children today spend prolonged periods of time playing sedentary video games. Active video games (AVGs) represent a novel and child friendly form of physical activity. Objectives To measure the energy cost of playing two AVGs in children with obesity and healthy age- and gender-matched children. Methods The energy cost of gaming and heart rates achieved during gaming conditions were compared between groups. Results AVG play can result in light-to-moderate intensity physical activity (2.7-5.4metabolic equivalents). When corrected for fat-free mass those with obesity expended significantly less energy than healthy weight peers playing Nintendo Wii Fit Free Jogging (P=0.017). No significant difference was seen between groups in the energy cost of playing Boxing. Conclusion Certain AVGs, particularly those that require lower limb movement, could be used to increase total energy expenditure, replace more sedentary activities, or achieve moderate intensity physical activity among children with obesity. There seems to be some differences in how children with obesity and children of a healthy weight play AVGs. This could result in those with obesity expending less energy than their lean peers during AVG play. © 2013 The Authors.

,The Impact Of Loss Of Control On Movement Bcis,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are known to suffer from spontaneous changes in the brain activity. If changes in the mental state of the user are reflected in the brain signals used for control, the behavior of a BCI is directly influenced by these states. We investigate the influence of a state of loss of control in a variant of Pacman on the performance of BCIs based on motor control. To study the effect a temporal loss of control has on the BCI performance, BCI classifiers were trained on electroencephalography (EEG) recorded during the normal control condition, and the classification performance on segments of EEG from the normal and loss of control condition was compared. Classifiers based on event-related desynchronization unexpectedly performed significantly better during the loss of control condition; for the event-related potential classifiers there was no significant difference in performance. © 2006 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TNSRE.2011.2166562,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering,"Reuderink B., Poel M., Nijholt A.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,The Impact Of Prolonged Violent Video-Gaming On Adolescent Sleep: An Experimental Study,"Video-gaming is an increasingly prevalent activity among children and adolescents that is known to influence several areas of emotional, cognitive and behavioural functioning. Currently there is insufficient experimental evidence about how extended video-game play may affect adolescents' sleep. The aim of this study was to investigate the shortterm impact of adolescents' prolonged exposure to violent video-gaming on sleep. Seventeen male adolescents (mean age = 16 ± 1 years) with no current sleep difficulties played a novel, fast-paced, violent videogame (50 or 150 min) before their usual bedtime on two different testing nights in a sleep laboratory. Objective (polysomnography-measured sleep and heart rate) and subjective (single-night sleep diary) measures were obtained to assess the arousing effects of prolonged gaming. Compared with regular gaming, prolonged gaming produced decreases in objective sleep efficiency (by 7 ± 2%, falling below 85%) and total sleep time (by 27 ± 12 min) that was contributed by a near-moderate reduction in rapid eye movement sleep (Cohen's d = 0.48). Subjective sleep-onset latency significantly increased by 17 ± 8 min, and there was a moderate reduction in self-reported sleep quality after prolonged gaming (Cohen's d = 0.53). Heart rate did not differ significantly between video-gaming conditions during pre-sleep game-play or the sleep-onset phase. Results provide evidence that prolonged video-gaming may cause clinically significant disruption to adolescent sleep, even when sleep after video-gaming is initiated at normal bedtime. However, physiological arousal may not necessarily be the mechanism by which technology use affects sleep. © 2012 European Sleep Research Society.",doi,10.1111/j.1365-2869.2012.01060.x,Scopus,Journal of Sleep Research,"King D.L., Gradisar M., Drummond A., Lovato N., Wessel J., Micic G., Douglas P., Delfabbro P.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,The Impact Of Sexual Arousal On Sexual Risk-Taking And Decision-Making In Men And Women,"Sexual arousal has emerged as an important contextual feature in sexual encounters that can impact safer-sex decision-making. We conducted two experiments that investigated the effects of sexual arousal among male and female participants. Experiment 1 (N = 144) examined the impact of sexual around on sexual health decision-making. Sexually explicit and neutral video clips as well as hypothetical romantic scenarios were used to evaluate the effects of sexual arousal on sexual risk-taking intentions. Men and women who reported higher levels of sexual arousal also displayed greater intentions to participate in risky sexual behavior (e.g., unprotected sex with a new sex partner). Experiment 2 (N = 122) examined the impact of sexual arousal on general risk-taking, using the same videos clips as in Experiment 1 and a modified version of a computerized Blackjack card game. Participants were offered a chance to make either a risky play or a safe play during ambiguous conditions. Increased sexual arousal in Experiment 2 was associated with impulsivity and a greater willingness to make risky plays in the Blackjack game. These findings suggest that, in situations where there are strong sexually visceral cues, both men and women experiencing strong sexual arousal may have lower inhibitions and may experience impaired decision-making. This phenomenon may have an impact during sexual encounters and may contribute to a failure to use appropriate prophylactic protection. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",doi,10.1007/s10508-015-0589-y,Scopus,Archives of Sexual Behavior,"Skakoon-Sparling S., Cramer K.M., Shuper P.A.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,The Impact Of Sound In Modern Multiline Video Slot Machine Play,"Slot machine wins and losses have distinctive, measurable, physiological effects on players. The contributing factors to these effects remain under-explored. We believe that sound is one of these key contributing factors. Sound plays an important role in reinforcement, and thus on arousal level and stress response of players. It is the use of sound for positive reinforcement in particular that we believe influences the player. In the current study, we investigate the role that sound plays in psychophysical responses to slot machine play. A total of 96 gamblers played a slot machine simulator with and without sound being paired with reinforcement. Skin conductance responses and heart rate, as well as subjective judgments about the gambling experience were examined. The results showed that the sound influenced the arousal of participants both psychophysically and psychologically. The sound also influenced players' preferences, with the majority of players preferring to play slot machines that were accompanied by winning sounds.

,The Independent Production Of Culture: A Digital Games Case Study,"Throughout the community of game players, developers, and journalists, the term ''independent'' is used in a number of ways to describe a type of development next to, or juxtaposed with, the mainstream process of creating, marketing, distributing, and playing digital games. Yet, this ''independence'' is something quite different from what the literature on independent, alternative, oppositional, radical, or otherwise nonmainstream media tends to suggest or advocate. The contemporary context of game design and development practices throughout the industry forces us to rethink assumptions about independence and autonomy in creative labor, about the communicative practices between media companies across the entire business spectrum of the global media industry, and about diversity or homogeneity in the production of culture.

,The Influence Of Violent And Nonviolent Computer Games On Implicit Measures Of Aggressiveness,"We examined the causal relationship between playing violent video games and increases in aggressiveness by using implicit measures of aggressiveness, which have become important for accurately predicting impulsive behavioral tendencies. Ninety-six adults were randomly assigned to play one of three versions of a computer game that differed only with regard to game content (violent, peaceful, or abstract game), or to work on a reading task. In the games the environmental context, mouse gestures, and physiological arousal-as indicated by heart rate and skin conductance-were kept constant. In the violent game soldiers had to be shot, in the peaceful game sunflowers had to be watered, and the abstract game simply required clicking colored triangles. Five minutes of play did not alter trait aggressiveness, yet an Implicit Association Test detected a change in implicit aggressive selfconcept. Playing a violent game produced a significant increase in implicit aggressive self-concept relative to playing a peaceful game. The well-controlled study closes a gap in the research on the causality of the link between violence exposure in computer games and aggressiveness with specific regard to implicit measures. We discuss the significance of importing recent social-cognitive theory into aggression research and stress the need for further development of aggression-related implicit measures. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",doi,10.1002/ab.20329,Scopus,Aggressive Behavior,"Bluemke M., Friedrich M., Zumbach J.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma: Early Experiences With Learning Classifier System-Based Simple Agents,"Prior research on artificial agents/agencies involves entities using specifically tailored operational strategies (e.g., for information retrieval, purchase negotiation). In some situations, however, an agent must interact with others whose strategies are initially unknown and whose interests may counter its own. In such circumstances, pre-defining effective counter-strategies could become difficult or impractical. One solution, which may be viable in certain contexts, is to create agents that self-evolve increasingly effective strategies from rudimentary beginnings, during actual deployment. Using the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) problem as a generic agent-interaction setting, we use the Learning Classifier System (LCS) paradigm to construct autonomously adapting ""simple"" agents. A simple agent attempts to cope by maintaining an evolving but potentially perennially incomplete and imperfect knowledge base. These agents operate against specifically tailored (non-adaptive) agents. We present a preliminary suite of simulation experiments and results. The promise evidenced leads us to articulate several additional areas of interesting investigations that we are pursuing. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

,The Play's The Thing: A Clinical-Developmental Perspective On Video Games,"Electronic play has the potential to contribute positively to children's socioemotional development by facilitating children's making sense of the world around them, developing and refining their abilities to distinguish between fantasy and reality, considering and experimenting with aggression through a safe environment, improving their self-regulation of arousal, and negotiating societal roles and rules. Electronic play also has the potential to benefit children and adolescents in clinical settings, including psychotherapy, treatment of impulsivity and attention deficit disorders, and pain management during medical procedures. As we further our understanding of the role of electronic play in children's lives, we can incorporate this knowledge into our clinical work to expand our application of effective tools and methods with children and adolescents. Further research is needed in this area. Future studies should use clearly and carefully operationalized definitions of variables and constructs, focus on subsets of the population that may be at particular risk, incorporate a developmental perspective, and address issues that relate to culture and socioeconomic status. Future studies also should consider the possible benefits of electronic play in the everyday lives of children and adolescents and in clinical settings. Because our understanding of the role of electronic play in clinical settings is currently limited, clinicians should use particular care in developing a treatment that appropriately matches the relevant characteristics of the games and the play experience with a child or adolescent's particular issues, needs, or condition. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

,"The Player And The Game: Compulsion, Relation, And Potential Space In Video Games","For years, video games have been anecdotally associated with psychopathology, despite their increasing popularity among the general public and the lack of empirical evidence to support such a link. In this article, the author argues that games are more than symptoms and that game worlds can act as a kind of potential space (Winnicott, 1971/2005) not fully belonging to either intrapsychic or objective reality, but making contact with both. This space allows players to engage with complex psychological material-such as compulsions, self-andother relations, morality, and personal growth-in vivo during the play session. Through exploration of the structural building blocks of games and specific case examples, the author suggests that an understanding of how and why patients play games can serve as an important clinical tool for sparking therapeutic change. © 2015 American Psychological Association.",doi,10.1037/a0038518,Scopus,Psychoanalytic Psychology,Kriss A.,2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,The Reeducation Of Emotional Expressions For Children With Autism Spectrum Disorders Thanks To Information Communication Technologies: Jemime Project [Rééducation De L'expression Émotionnelle Chez L'enfant Avec Trouble Du Spectre Autistique Grâce Aux Supports Numériques : Le Projet Jemime],"The use of serious games to promote social skills in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been a focus of interest during the past 10 years. We begin with a review of the literature regarding serious games proposed for individuals with ASD that focus on emotion processing. We found a total of 16 games but their overall quality was often limited both in terms of design/playability and clinical interest/efficacy. Additionally the study of emotion production was absent with the games being focused on emotion recognition. Second, we describe the design principles and the computational architecture of a novel serious game, JEMImE, that aims to promote uni and bimodal emotion production in individuals with ASD. We detail the technological gap and the need to compute an automated algorithm able to recognize emotion in real time in order to give feed-back to the player. This algorithm will be designed based on machine learning principles. To achieve this goal, we created a video database including more than 150 children and adolescents with typical development who were producing emotion. © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS",doi,10.1016/j.neurenf.2016.12.002,Scopus,Neuropsychiatrie de l'Enfance et de l'Adolescence,"Grossard C., Hun S., Serret S., Grynszpan O., Foulon P., Dapogny A., Bailly K., Chaby L., Cohen D.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,The Relationship Between Online Video Game Involvement And Gaming-Related Friendships Among Emotionally Sensitive Individuals,"Some researchers believe that online gaming spaces can be socially accommodating environments for socially inhibited individuals, such as the socially inept, socially anxious, or shy. While previous research has examined, and found, significant links between these populations and online video game play, it remains unknown to what extent these spaces are contributing to tangible social benefits for the socially inhibited. The current study addresses this question by evaluating the link between gaming-related friendships and shyness, as quantified by emotional sensitivity. Drawing from a representative sample of German game players, the results indicate that emotionally sensitive players are using online gaming spaces differently from their less emotionally sensitive counterparts and reporting tangible differences in their in-game friendship networks. This suggests that online games hold the potential to be socially advantageous for shy individuals by allowing them to overcome their traditional social difficulties and generate new friendships as well as strengthen old ones. © 2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2014.",doi,10.1089/cyber.2013.0656,Scopus,"Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking","Kowert R., Domahidi E., Quandt T.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,The Role Of Flow Experience In Cyber-Game Addiction,"Consumer habit, an important key to repetitive consumption, is an interesting yet puzzling phenomenon. Sometimes this consumption becomes obsessive-consumers will continue to act a certain way even when they feel it is not in their best interests. However, not all consumers develop such addictions. This study uses cyber-game addiction syndrome as an analogue to trace the possible causes of consumer addiction. Results from structure equation modeling show that repetition of favorite activities has a moderate effect upon addiction, which is in line with the assertion of rational addiction theory. However, flow experience-the emotional state embracing perceptional distortion and enjoyment-shows a much stronger impact on addiction. This suggests that consumers who have experienced flow are more likely to be addicted.",doi,10.1089/109493103322725469,Scopus,Cyberpsychology and Behavior,"Chou T.-J., Ting C.-C.",2003,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,The Role Of Reciprocity In Verbally Persuasive Robots,"The current research examines the persuasive effects of reciprocity in the context of human-robot interaction. This is an important theoretical and practical extension of persuasive robotics by testing (1) if robots can utilize verbal requests and (2) if robots can utilize persuasive mechanisms (e.g., reciprocity) to gain human compliance. Participants played a trivia game with a robot teammate. The ostensibly autonomous robot helped (or failed to help) the participants by providing the correct (vs. incorrect) trivia answers. Then, the robot directly asked participants to complete a 15-minute task for pattern recognition. Compared to no help, results showed that a robot's prior helping behavior significantly increased the likelihood of compliance (60 percent vs. 33 percent). Interestingly, participants' evaluations toward the robot (i.e., competence, warmth, and trustworthiness) did not predict compliance. These results also provided an insightful comparison showing that participants complied at similar rates with the robot and with computer agents. This result documents a clear empirically powerful potential for the role of verbal messages in persuasive robotics.

,The Role Of Video Game Playing In Adolescent Life: Is There Reason To Be Concerned?,"One hundred fifty-one subjects from 10 to 20 years old were surveyed to determine their attitudes toward video game playing and its role in their lives. Concerns have been expressed in the public media that video game playing is addictive for youngsters and leads to excessive expenditures of time and money, poorer school performance, reduced involvement in sports, and less opportunity to develop social skills. The survey data did not support these contentions. Although approximately 10% of the subjects appeared to show some compulsive aspects in their play, no identifiable problems were correlated with the amount of time spent playing. For the great majority, video game playing was an enjoyable activity held in perspective with other aspects of their lives.

,The Roles Of Dopamine And Hypocretin In Reward: A Electroencephalographic Study,"The proper functioning of the mesolimbic reward system is largely dependent on the neurotransmitter dopamine. Recent evidence suggests that the hypocretin system has significant projections to this reward system. We examined the distinct effects of reduced dopamine or reduced hypocretin levels on reward activity in patients with Parkinson's disease, dopamine deficient, as well as patients with narcolepsy-cataplexy, hypocretin depleted, and healthy controls. Participants performed a simple game-like task while high-density electroencephalography was recorded. Topography and timing of event-related potentials for both reward cue, and reward feedback was examined across the entire dataset. While response to reward cue was similar in all groups, two distinct time points were found to distinguish patients and controls for reward feedback. Around 160ms both patient groups had reduced ERP amplitude compared to controls. Later at 250ms, both patient groups also showed a clear event-related potential (ERP), which was absent in controls. The initial differences show that both patient groups show a similar, blunted response to reward delivery. The second potential corresponds to the classic feedback-related negativity (FRN) potential which relies on dopamine activity and reflects reward prediction-error signaling. In particular the mismatch between predicted reward and reward subsequently received was significantly higher in PD compared to NC, independent of reward magnitude and valence. The intermediate FRN response in NC highlights the contribution of hypocretin in reward processing, yet also shows that this is not as detrimental to the reward system as in Parkinson's. Furthermore, the inability to generate accurate predictions in NC may explain why hypocretin deficiency mediates cataplexy triggered by both positive and negative emotions. © 2015 Mensen et al.

,The Standardized Mental Stress Test Protocol: Test‐Retest Reliability And Comparison With Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring,"The mental stress test protocol is used extensively in research, but different laboratories often employ different stress tasks, utilize different dependent variables to index the stress response, and perform different transformations on the gathered data. The present study determined the test‐retest reliability of 11 cardiovascular dependent variables during a resting baseline and three common stress tasks: playing a video game, performing a choice reaction‐time test, and performing a cold‐pressor test. Sixty healthy, middle‐aged males underwent testing twice, approximately three months apart. Instructions were delivered via videotape and data were gathered on‐line by computer to ensure a standard laboratory environment. Each task elicited significant increases in blood pressure, vascular rigidity, LVET, heart rate, and stroke volume. In addition, the cold‐pressor test led to increases in total systemic resistance and mean systolic ejection rate. The absolute levels of the 11 dependent variables were correlated across tasks (partial r, baseline removed, = .06 to .69, 32 of 33 comparisons significant at p<.05), indicating that reactivity to stress generalizes across alternate test forms. The absolute levels also showed significant test‐retest reliability (r= .32 to .82; 40 of 44 comparisons significant at p<.05). In addition, for 19 of 33 comparisons, absolute levels showed greater test‐retest reliability than change scores derived by subtracting the initial resting baseline value from the stress‐task value. Finally, blood pressures taken during the stress tests were more highly correlated with the average blood pressures measured via ambulatory monitoring than casual office pressures, suggesting that such stress values may more accurately reflect average blood pressure.

,The Temporal Course Of The Influence Of Anxiety On Fairness Considerations,"This study investigated the potential causes of anxious people's social avoidance. The classic ultimatum game was utilized in concert with electroencephalogram recording. Participants were divided into two groups according to levels of trait anxiety as identified by a self-report scale. The behavioral results indicate that high-anxious participants were more prone to reject human-proposed than computer-proposed unequal offers compared to their low-anxious counterparts. The event-related potential results indicate that the high-anxious group showed a larger feedback-related negativity when receiving unequal monetary offers than equal ones, and a larger P3 when receiving human-proposed offers than computer-proposed ones, but these effects were absent in the low-anxious group. We suggest anxious people's social avoidance results from hypersensitivity to unequal distributions during interpersonal interactions. © 2014 Society for Psychophysiological Research.",doi,10.1111/psyp.12235,Scopus,Psychophysiology,"Luo Y., Wu T., Broster L.S., Feng C., Zhang D., Gu R., Luo Y.-J.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,"The Thrill Is Gone, But You Might Not Know: Habituation And Generalization Of Biophysiological And Self-Reported Arousal Responses To Video Games","Past research on consequences of video game play have conflated two distinct psychological mechanisms, habituation and generalization, into a unified process dubbed “desensitization.” The current paper reports the results of two studies, a repeated exposure study and a single exposure study, which examine habituation and generalization of biophysiological and self-reported arousal responses to violent video games. The findings indicate that repeated play leads to habituation in both biophysiological and self-report responses. Notably, evidence of generalization is more apparent in the biophysiological data. The results are discussed in terms of: (1) implications for game developers and players, (2) implications for game researchers, (3) current conceptual ambiguity between cross-sectional and longitudinal models, and (4) the appropriateness of utilizing self-report measures in longitudinal studies examining arousal. © 2015 National Communication Association.",doi,10.1080/03637751.2014.971418,Scopus,Communication Monographs,"Grizzard M., Tamborini R., Sherry J.L., Weber R., Prabhu S., Hahn L., Idzik P.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,The Timing Of Appraisals,"The appraisal process consists of the subjective evaluation that occurs during an individual's encounter with significant events in the environment, determining the nature of the emotional reaction and experience. Placed in the context of appraisal theories of emotion-elicitation and differentiation, the aim of the present research was to test empirically the hypothesis that the intrinsic pleasantness evaluation occurs before the goal conduciveness evaluation. In two studies, intrinsically pleasant and unpleasant images were used to manipulate pleasantness, and a specific event in a Pacman-type videogame was used to manipulate goal conduciveness. Facial EMG was used to measure facial reactions to each evaluation. As predicted, facial reactions to the intrinsic pleasantness manipulation were faster than facial reactions to the goal conduciveness manipulation. These results provide good empirical support for the sequential nature of the appraisal process. © 2007 APA, all rights reserved.",doi,10.1037/1528-3542.7.1.207,Scopus,Emotion,"Lanctôt N., Hess U.",2007,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,The Unexpected Comfort Of Wearing Headphones: Emotional And Cognitive Effects Of Headphone Use When Playing A Bloody Video Game,"This study tests the theory of vivid media violence, exploring whether the presence of blood in a violent game and the use of headphones impacts emotions (frustration, fear, anxiety) and the level of cognitive elaboration. Results of an experiment suggest participants felt stronger negative emotions when playing a bloody game with headphones off. When the video game was not bloody, headphones did not affect emotions. In addition, frustration was related to cognitive elaboration whereas fear and anxiety were not.

,The Use Of A Skill-Based Activity In Therapeutic Induction,"This paper describes a hypnotherapeutic intervention for a brain damaged 36-year-old male who has suffered from asthma since infancy and seizure disorder from the age of eight. In early sessions it was discovered that conventional “passive-relaxation” induction techniques seemed to exacerbate certain disturbing somatic experiences, which he refers to as scary feelings. It was found that his performance of a previously learned skilled activity (the playing of the computer game Tetris) permitted the experience of a highly focused but relaxed state that was conducive to therapeutic interaction. This approach to induction bears similarity to “active-alert” procedures but may be more importantly related to Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's principle of flow, in that it involves engagement in a subjectively meaningful, skill-based ac tivity. © 2001 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",doi,10.1080/00029157.2001.10403467,Scopus,American Journal of Clinical Hypnosis,Winter W.E.,2001,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,The Use Of The Virtual Reality As Intervention Tool In The Postoperative Of Cardiac Surgery [O Uso Da Realidade Virtual Como Ferramenta Complementar No Pós-Operatório De Cirurgia Cardíaca],"Introduction: Cardiac surgery has been the intervention of choice in many cases of cardiovascular diseases. Susceptibility to postoperative complications, cardiac rehabilitation is indicated. Therapeutic resources, such as virtual reality has been helping the rehabilitational process. The aim of the study was to evaluate the use of virtual reality in the functional rehabilitation of patients in the postoperative period. Methods: Patients were randomized into two groups, Virtual Reality (VRG, n = 30) and Control (CG, n = 30). The response to treatment was assessed through the functional independence measure (FIM), by the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP). Evaluations were performed preoperatively and postoperatively. Results: On the first day after surgery, patients in both groups showed decreased functional performance. However, the VRG showed lower reduction (45.7±2.3) when compared toCG (35.06±2.09, P<0.05) in first postoperative day, and no sig-nifcant difference in performance on discharge day (P>0.05). In evaluating the NHP field, we observed a signifcant decrease in pain score at third assessment (P<0.05). These patients also had a higher energy level in the first evaluation (P<0.05). There were no differences with statistical significance for emotional reactions, physical ability, and social interaction. The length of stay was signifcantly shorter in patients of VRG (9.4±0.5 days vs. 12.2 ± 0.9 days, P<0.05), which also had a higher 6MWD (319.9±19.3 meters vs. 263.5±15.4 meters, P<0.02).Conclusion: Adjunctive treatment with virtual reality demonstrated benefits, with better functional performance in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.",doi,10.5935/1678-9741.20130039,Scopus,Brazilian Journal of Cardiovascular Surgery,"Cacau L.A.P., Oliveira G.U., Maynard L.G., de Araújo Filho A.A., da Silva Junior W.M., Cerqueria Neto M.L., Antoniolli A.R., Santana-Filho V.J.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Thermal Change In A Resin Block During Motorized And Manual Implant Placement,"Statement of problem Several studies have demonstrated the harmful role of heat generation during implant site drilling in subsequent bone healing. However, heat generation during implant placement should also be carefully considered. Purpose The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate thermal change in a resin block during motorized and manual implant placement with and without saline irrigation. Material and methods Thermocouple probes were placed in resin blocks to measure the thermal change during forty 3.75x15-mm self-tapping cylindrical screw implant placements as follows: MtI group, 10 motorized implant placements with external saline irrigation; MtNI group, 10 motorized implant placements without irrigation; MI group, 10 manual implant placements with external saline irrigation; MNI group, 10 manual implant placements without irrigation. The temperature values were recorded with a data acquisition system with a 20-channel multiplexer module connected to a personal computer. The normality of data distribution was assessed with the Shapiro-Wilk test and the homogeneity of variances with the Levene test. The mean temperatures of the groups was assessed with the 3-way ANOVA test followed by the Tukey HSD test for normal distribution and the Games-Howell test for non-normal distribution (α=.05). Results The rate of temperature rise in the resin blocks was 1.1°C to 7.3°C. The highest mean temperature was present in the group for manual implant placement without irrigation (26.2 ±1.1°C), and the lowest thermal change was in the motorized implant placement group with external saline irrigation (23.6 ±1.0°C). Conclusions The thermal change in resin blocks during motorized implant placement was lower than manual implant placement, especially with external saline irrigation. © 2016 Editorial Council for the Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry",doi,10.1016/j.prosdent.2016.04.021,Scopus,Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry,"Dal Molin Molinari A.R., Thomé C.A., Moura L.M., Kim S.H.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Toward Emotionally-Congruent Dynamic Soundtrack Generation,"Emotionally congruent sound effect generation can be particularly useful in interactive audio applications with non-linear narrative requirements (such as video gaming). The study of affect (broadly construed here as recognition of emotional suggestion rather than individual emotional response) increasingly concludes that acoustic features can have an influence on the perceived emotional characteristics of an audio signal, from environmental sounds to musical stimuli. This paper presents an investigative approach to measuring the relative impact of musical voicing, in particular musical timbre, on perceived emotion as reported by a panel of listeners, as part of work towards an automated system designed to manipulate sound effects in real-time according to a particular affective intent. In the future this type of system could combine selective spectro-temporal morphing between source sounds and affective acoustic correlates with musical feature quantification and interpolation in order to manipulate a palette of sound effects or music through an emotional space based on quantified affective correlates. © 2016.",doi,10.17743/jaes.2016.0038,Scopus,AES: Journal of the Audio Engineering Society,Williams D.,2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Toward Physiological Indices Of Emotional State Driving Future Ebook Interactivity,"Ebooks of the future may respond to the emoional experience of the reader. (Neuro-) physiological measures could capture a reader's emotional state and use this to enhance the reading experience by adding matching sounds or to change the storyline therewith creating a hybrid art form in between literature and gaming. We describe the theoretical foundation of the emotional and creative brain and review the neurophysiological indices that can be used to drive future ebook interactivity in a real life situation. As a case study, we report the neurophysiological measurements of a bestselling author during nine days of writing which can potentially be used later to compare them to those of the readers. In designated calibration blocks, the artist wrote emotional paragraphs for emotional (IAPS) pictures. Analyses showed that we can reliably distinguish writing blocks from resting but we found no reliable differences related to the emotional content of the writing. The study shows that measurements of EEG, heart rate (variability), skin conductance, facial expression and subjective ratings can be done over several hours a day and for several days in a row. In follow-up phases, we will measure 300 readers with a similar setup. © 2016 van Erp et al.",doi,10.7717/peerj-cs.60,Scopus,PeerJ Computer Science,"van Erp J.B.F., Hogervorst M.A., van der Werf Y.D.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali

In this study, a group of children with ASD and IQ-matched, typically developing (TD) children were trained to produce ‘‘happy’’ and ‘‘angry’’ expressions with the FaceMaze computer game. FaceMaze uses an automated computer recognition system that analyzes the child’s facial expression in real time. Before and after playing the Angry and Happy versions of FaceMaze, children posed ‘‘happy’’ and ‘‘angry’’ expressions. Naïve raters judged the post-FaceMaze ‘‘happy’’ and ‘‘angry’’ expressions of the ASD group as higher in quality than their pre-FaceMaze productions. Moreover, the post-game expressions of theASDgroup were rated as equal in quality as the expressions of the TD group. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014.",doi,10.1007/s10803-014-2118-6,Scopus,Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders,"Gordon I., Pierce M.D., Bartlett M.S., Tanaka J.W.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Tryptophan Enhancement/Depletion And Reactions To Failure On A Cooperative Computer Game,"Twenty-eight high trait hostility male volunteers played a 'cooperative' computer game 4.5 hours after an amino acid drink enhanced with, or depleted of, tryptophan. Each trial involved steering a tank through minefields following directions from an unknown 'partner.' Failure was experienced when the tank hit a mine or when time ran out. Subjects' moods, verbal aggression, attributions of blame, vocal acoustics, and blood pressure were assessed. Differences between tryptophan groups were not significant for primary measures of anger and verbal aggression. However, depleted subjects reported greater increases in feelings of restlessness and incompetence, were less successful in avoiding mines and showed greater increases in blood pressure during the game. Subjects in both groups sent more negative ratings when they lost the game by virtue of hitting a mine rather than losing by running out of time. However, ratings of the depleted group were less influenced by the reason for losing the game. Also, vocal acoustics showed a group x reason- for-losing interaction in the high-frequency band.

,Two-Dimensional Oscillatory Neural Network Based On Room-Temperature Charge-Density-Wave Devices,"We propose an oscillatory neural network implemented with two-dimensional (2-D) tantalum disulfide devices operating in the change density wave regime at room temperature. An elementary cell of the network consists of two 1T-TaS2 devices connected in series. Such a cell has a constant output and oscillatory states. All cells have the same bias voltage. There is a constant current flowing through the cell in the constant output mode. The oscillations occur at a certain bias voltage due to the electrical-field triggered metal-to-insulator transition owing to the changes in the charge-density-wave phase in the 1T-TaS2 channel. Two 1T-TaS2 devices oscillate out-of-phase when one of the devices is in the insulator phase while the other one is in the metallic state. The nearest-neighbor cells are coupled via graphene transistors. The cells are resistively coupled if the graphene transistor is in the on state while they are capacitively coupled if the transistor is in the off state. The operation of the oscillatory neural network is simulated numerically for the 30 × 30 node network. We present the examples of pattern recognition on a template with the fixed coupling among the near-neighbor cells. We also present the results of our numerical modeling mimicking the Game of Life in the network with the time-varying coupling. The 2-D 1T-TaS2 devices, utilized in the network, offer a unique combination of properties such as scalability, high operational frequency, fast synchronization speed, and radiation hardness, which makes them promising for both consumer electronic and defense applications. © 2002-2012 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TNANO.2017.2716845,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology,"Khitun A., Liu G., Balandin A.A.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Two-Player Partnered Exergame For Obesity Prevention: Using Discrepancy In Players' Abilities As A Strategy To Motivate Physical Activity.,"Physical inactivity is associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes. A key obstacle to physical activity is lack of motivation. Although some interactive exercise games (i.e., exergames--video games that require physical exertion in order to play) motivate players to exercise more, few games take advantage of group dynamics to motivate players' duration of exercise. In a test of the Köhler motivation gain effect, this study varied the ability level of a virtually presented partner in an interactive exergame that focused on abdominal strength to identify effects on a subject's (S') persistence with the task. Male (n = 63) and female (n = 72) undergraduate students were randomly assigned to one of four conditions (individual control or low-, moderate-, or high- partner discrepancy) in a conditions × gender factorial design and tested on a series of isometric abdominal exercises using PlayStation 2 EyeToy: Kinetic software. They performed the first series of five exercises alone (trial block 1), and after a rest period, those in the partner conditions performed remaining trials (trial block 2) with a same-sex virtually presented partner whom they could observe during their performance, while those in the individual control condition performed the remaining trials alone. In the partner conditions, the partner's performance was manipulated to be always better than the S's, the exact difference depending on the discrepancy condition. The partnered tasks were conjunctive; that is, success in the game depended on the performance of the weaker team member. Persistence, the outcome measure for this study, consisted of the total number of seconds the S held the exercise position. Using planned orthogonal contrasts on difference scores between blocks 1 and 2, results showed that persistence was significantly (p < .001) greater in all experimental conditions with a virtually presented partner (M = 33.59 s) than in the individual control condition (M = -49.04 s). Subjects demonstrated more persistence in the moderate-discrepancy condition (M = 51.36 s) than in the low-discrepancy condition (M = 22.52 s) or the high-discrepancy condition (M = 26.89 s). A significant quadratic trend confirmed the expected inverted-U function relating partner discrepancy and persistence (p = .025). Although Ss persisted longer and had higher heart rate in partnered conditions, they did not perceive their exertion to be any higher than those in the individual condition. Virtually presented partners who are moderately more capable than participants are the most effective at improving persistence in exergame tasks.",doi,10.1177/193229681200600413,pubmed,Journal of diabetes science and technology,"Feltz, Deborah L; Irwin, Brandon; Kerr, Norbert",2013,NA,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Understanding Stress And Coping Among Competitive Athletes In Sport: Applying Psychological Theory And Research,"It is commonly accepted that the competitive sports environment is characterized by situations of intense pressure presenting a potentially stressful environment (Hanton et al., 2005; Rumbold et al., 2012). Sport performers must manage a range of pressures and psychological responses if they are to fulfil their potential. Consider the case of Rebecca Adlington: during the Beijing Olympic Games (2008) she became the first British woman to win two Olympic swimming gold medals. Four years later, at the London 2012 Olympic Games, Rebecca talked about the pressures of trying to emulate her 2008 success while competing at a home games: The most I've ever competed in front of at home is 2,500. I'm not used to that crowd reaction coming out . . . maybe it's a little bit overwhelming for us all . . . I think the pressure, the expectation and everything going into this meet has been a little bit of a battle.1 Being able to successfully help individuals fulfil their potential presents an ambitious objective for someone in any profession. In sport, as illustrated above, there may be occasions where an athlete's mind is invaded by unpleasant thoughts and emotions that are associated with perceiving competition as a huge pressure. High-profile examples such as Rebecca's could represent the tip of a metaphoric iceberg whereby the pressures of achieving and maintaining sporting excellence may lead to unhappiness and underperformance. Where individuals are unable to effectively cope with such pressures, they are likely to experience poor performance, feel dissatisfied with their experiences and possibly drop out of sport (Sagar et al., 2009; Voight, 2009). Research indicates that, as well as experiencing stressors resulting directly from the sport organization (selection pressures, personal performance), athletes may at the same time be experiencing academic, employment, developmental and social stressors (Devonport and Lane, 2009; Devonport et al., 2013; Smetana et al., 2006; Sullivan and Nashman, 1998). Sport stressors (such as selection issues or training demands) and nonsport stressors (such as relationship issues or exam pressures) may occur independently of each other, or may co-occur and/or interact. Any one stressor or combination of stressors has the potential to challenge an athlete's ability to cope and, ultimately, may influence their ability to train and compete optimally. Rebecca Adlington illustrated the challenges of managing combined stressors during a television interview recorded in December 2009 with the BBC.2 Within this interview, she comments: It's been hard for me to deal with everything after Beijing, like being recognised, and there are other things like moving house and personal situations, your swimming gets affected by that . . . Growing up, it's hard enough to deal with change anyway, with your body shape, and changing as a woman. A responsibility for researchers and applied practitioners alike is to seek to understand the environments in which athletes operate, and identify and develop strategies to manage stressors. Enhancing coping skills that could be used to manage stress in different domains of an athlete's life is a strategy that is worth pursuing. The development of generic coping-skill interventions may help attenuate stressors and facilitate the achievement of personal goals across domains (Smith, 1999). © 2016 Andrew M. Lane.

,"Understanding The Relationship Between Exergame Play Experiences, Enjoyment, And Intentions For Continued Play","Objective: Although it is generally understood that exergames can be beneficial, more research is needed to understand how in-game experiences influence enjoyment and the likelihood for continued use of these types of games. Therefore, the objective of this research is to understand how player performance in an exergame affects psychological responses (autonomy, competence, and presence), enjoyment of the experience, and likelihood for future play. Subjects and Methods: Sixty-two college students (mean age, 20.32 years) participated in an experiment where they played a challenge event on the ""Biggest Loser"" exergame for the Nintendo (Kyoto, Japan) Wii™ console. Participants were given up to two chances to see if they could ""win"" the challenge event. A lab assistant recorded player performance for each session in minutes and seconds (range, 30 seconds-10 minutes). The attempt in which the participant achieved the greatest amount of time playing was used as a measure of player performance. After playing, subjects filled out a questionnaire with items pertaining to enjoyment, competence, autonomy, presence, and future intentions for continued use of the exergame. Results: The results suggest that player achievement (longer time spent playing) directly and indirectly predicts feelings of autonomy, competence, presence, enjoyment, and future intentions to play. Individuals who performed better felt more autonomous and experienced greater presence, leading to greater enjoyment. Enjoyment and presence were found to mediate the relationship between player performance and future intentions to play an exergame. Conclusions: This study suggests that performance in exergames is related to psychological experiences that fuel enjoyment and the likelihood for future exergame use. The theoretical and practical significances of these findings are discussed, as well as future research involving exergames. © Copyright 2016, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016.",doi,10.1089/g4h.2015.0042,Scopus,Games for Health Journal,"Limperos A.M., Schmierbach M.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,"Use Of Active-Play Video Games To Enhance Aerobic Fitness In Schizophrenia: Feasibility, Safety, And Adherence","Objective: Active-play video games have been used to enhance aerobic fitness in various clinical populations, but their use among individuals with schizophrenia has been limited. Methods: Feasibility, acceptability, safety, and adherence data were obtained for use of aerobic exercise (AE) equipment by 16 individuals with schizophrenia during a 12-week AE program consisting of three one-hour exercise sessions per week. Equipment included exercise video games for Xbox 360 with Kinect motion sensing devices and traditional exercise equipment. Results: Most participants (81%) completed the training, attending an average of 79% of sessions. The proportion of time spent playing Xbox (39%) exceeded time spent on any other type of equipment. When using Xbox, participants played 2.2461.59 games per session and reported high acceptability and enjoyment ratings, with no adverse events.

,User Experiences While Playing Dance-Based Exergames And The Influence Of Different Body Motion Sensing Technologies,"Dance Dance Revolution is a pioneering exergame which has attracted considerable interest for its potential to promote regular exercise and its associated health benefits. The advent of a range of different consumer body motion tracking video game console peripherals raises the question whether their different technological affordances (i.e., variations in the type and number of body limbs that they can track) influence the user experience while playing dance-based exergames both in terms of the level of physical exertion and the nature of the play experience. To investigate these issues a group of subjects performed a total of six comparable dance routines selected from commercial dance-based exergames (two routines from each game) on three different consoles. The subjects' level of physical exertion was assessed by measuring oxygen consumption and heart rate. They also reported their perceived level of exertion, difficulty, and enjoyment ratings after completing each dance routine. No differences were found in the physiological measures of exertion between the peripherals/consoles. However, there were significant variations in the difficulty and enjoyment ratings between peripherals. The design implications of these results are discussed including the tension between helping to guide and coordinate player movement versus offering greater movement flexibility. © 2013 Alasdair G.

,Using Human Physiology To Evaluate Subtle Expressivity Of A Virtual Quizmaster In A Mathematical Game,"The aim of the experimental study described in this article is to investigate the effect of a life-like character with subtle expressivity on the affective state of users. The character acts as a quizmaster in the context of a mathematical game. This application was chosen as a simple, and for the sake of the experiment, highly controllable, instance of human-computer interfaces and software. Subtle expressivity refers to the character's affective response to the user's performance by emulating multimodal human-human communicative behavior such as different body gestures and varying linguistic style. The impact of em-pathic behavior, which is a special form of affective response, is examined by deliberately frustrating the user during the game progress. There are two novel aspects in this investigation. First, we employ an animated interface agent to address the affective state of users rather than a text-based interface, which has been used in related research. Second, while previous empirical studies rely on questionnaires to evaluate the effect of life-like characters, we utilize physiological information of users (in addition to questionnaire data) in order to precisely associate the occurrence of interface events with users' autonomic nervous system activity. The results of our study indicate that empathic character response can significantly decrease user stress and that affective behavior may have a positive effect on users' perception of the difficulty of a task. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

,Using Social Simulations To Assess And Train Potential Leaders To Make Effective Decisions In Turbulent Environments,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to describe two social simulations created to assess leadership potential and train leaders to make effective decisions in turbulent environments. One is set in the novel environment of a lunar moon colony and the other is a military combat command. The research generated from these simulations for assessing the decision effectiveness of potential leaders with different personality traits and decision styles under varying degrees of information quantity, uncertainty and complexity is summarized. Opportunities and limitations of applying current computer assisted technology to social simulations for assessing and developing leaders' decision effectiveness in turbulent environments is discussed. Design/methodology/ approach - College undergraduates and officer candidates in university ROTC programs made a series of decisions while being subjected to varying degrees of environmental turbulence in social simulations. The decision effectiveness of subjects with different personality characteristics under varying degrees of environmental turbulence was assessed through researcher observations, self-reports, and peer ratings. Findings - Social simulations are a cost effective way to assess and train leaders to make effective decisions in turbulent environments. The results of controlled experiments in social simulations have suggested that leaders with high levels of cognitive complexity and incongruity adaptation are more likely to be successful in highly turbulent environments than leaders with lower levels of incongruity adaptation ability and cognitive complexity who are more effective in more stable and structured situations. Research limitations/implications - The ease of modifying computer games renders them effective as low-cost virtual worlds that have relevance in military leadership experimentation. However, the use of computer simulations alone fails to capture the impact that relationships and emotions have on leader decision making, highlighting the continuing need for social simulations that include these interpersonal aspects of decision making. Practical implications - By participating in realistic social simulations, leaders can experiment with new decision styles without the risk of making real world mistakes that could jeopardize their own and their organization's future. The leaders who are most successful in adapting their decision style to the more complex requirements can be identified for promotion or assignment to appropriate settings. Originality/value - Both military and civilian organizations are in need of cost effective way to assess and train leaders to make effective decisions in turbulent environments. Social simulations provide a unique approach to meeting these needs and can simultaneously provide a venue for research in associated areas. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",doi,10.1108/13620430710756744,Scopus,Career Development International,Hunsaker P.L.,2007,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Utilising A Computer Game As A Therapeutic Intervention For Youth In Residential Care: Some Preliminary Findings On Use And Acceptability,"Mental illness is common amongst young people living in residential care, many of whom are reluctant to avail of therapeutic help. The potential value of computer games as therapeutic tools for these young people has received very little attention, despite indications of their potential for promoting engagement in therapeutic work and improving mental health outcomes. This study aimed to fill this research gap through the development, introduction, and preliminary evaluation of a therapeutic intervention in group care settings. The intervention incorporated a commercially available computer game (. The SIMS Life Stories™) and emotion regulation skill coaching. Qualified residential social workers were trained to deliver it to young people in three children's homes in Northern Ireland, where therapeutic approaches to social work had been introduced. The research was framed as an exploratory case study which aimed to determine the acceptability and potential therapeutic value of this intervention. The evidence suggests that computer-game based interventions of this type may have value as therapeutic tools in group care settings and deserve further development and empirical investigation to determine their effectiveness in improving mental health outcomes. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.childyouth.2014.10.012,Scopus,Children and Youth Services Review,"Aventin A., Houston S., Macdonald G.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,"Valence, Arousal And Dominance In The Eeg During Game Play","In this paper, we describe our investigation of traces of naturally occurring emotions in electrical brain signals, that can be used to build interfaces that respond to our emotional state. This study confirms a number of known affective correlates in a realistic, uncontrolled environment for the emotions of valence (or pleasure), arousal and dominance: (1) a significant decrease in frontal power in the theta range is found for increasingly positive valence, (2) a significant frontal increase in power in the alpha range is associated with increasing emotional arousal, (3) a significant right posterior power increase in the delta range correlates with increasing arousal and (4) asymmetry in power in the lower alpha bands correlates with self-reported valence. Furthermore, asymmetry in the higher alpha bands correlates with self-reported dominance. These last two effects provide a simple measure for subjective feelings of pleasure and feelings of control.

This study compared the nonverbal displays of emotion for American and Canadian television game show contestants. Results suggested that although Americans and Canadians did not differ significantly in the types of emotions displayed, Americans were rated as being significantly more expressive in their emotional display. In addition, Americans differed from Canadians in their forms of nonverbal display. American females were seen as using their hands more than the Canadian females. American males were seen to smile more than their Canadian counterparts. Discussion explored how methodology introduced in this study could be conveniently expanded to more conclusively explore culturally determined display rules. Consideration of current video cassette technology facilitating this form of investigation was discussed. © 1985 Human Sciences Press.",doi,10.1007/BF00987142,Scopus,Journal of Nonverbal Behavior,Waxer P.H.,1985,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Video Game Playing Time And Cardiometabolic Risk In Adolescents: The Afinos Study.,"We aimed to examine the association of video games playing time with cardiometabolic risk biomarkers in adolescents. This study comprised 181 adolescents (88 girls), aged 13- to 17 years old. Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was measured by accelerometry, and video game playing time in computer and console was self-reported. Waist circumference, systolic blood pressure (BP) and diastolic BP, mean arterial pressure, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, insulin, and apolipoproteins A-1 and B-100 were measured. Computer games use was not significantly associated with any biomarker (P>0.1) but the time spent using console games was positively associated with diastolic BP, mean arterial pressure, triglycerides, and a clustered cardiometabolic risk score. These results were independent of age, sex, pubertal stage, MVPA, and WC. These results support some evidence regarding a plausible unfavorable role of playing (console) video games on cardiometabolic health in adolescence.",doi,10.1016/j.medcli.2012.04.017,pubmed,Medicina clinica,"Martinez-Gómez, David; Gomez-Martinez, Sonia; Ruiz, Jonatan R; Ortega, Francisco B; Marcos, Ascension; Veiga, Oscar L",2013,NA,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,"Video Games And Aggressive Thoughts, Feelings, And Behavior In The Laboratory And In Life.","Two studies examined violent video game effects on aggression-related variables. Study 1 found that real-life violent video game play was positively related to aggressive behavior and delinquency. The relation was stronger for individuals who are characteristically aggressive and for men. Academic achievement was negatively related to overall amount of time spent playing video games. In Study 2, laboratory exposure to a graphically violent video game increased aggressive thoughts and behavior. In both studies, men had a more hostile view of the world than did women. The results from both studies are consistent with the General Affective Aggression Model, which predicts that exposure to violent video games will increase aggressive behavior in both the short term (e.g., laboratory aggression) and the long term (e.g., delinquency).

,Video Lottery: Winning Expectancies And Arousal,"Aims: This study investigates the effects of video lottery players' expectancies of winning on physiological and subjective arousal. Design: Participants were assigned randomly to one of two experimental conditions: high and low winning expectancies. Setting: Participants played 100 video lottery games in a laboratory setting while physiological measures were recorded. Level of risk-taking was controlled. Participants: Participants were 34 occasional or regular video lottery players. They were assigned randomly into two groups of 17, with nine men and eight women in each group. Intervention: The low-expectancy group played for fun, therefore expecting to win worthless credits, while the high-expectancy group played for real money. Measurements: Players' experience, demographic variables and subjective arousal were assessed. Severity of problem gambling was measured with the South Oaks Gambling Screen. In order to measure arousal, the average heart rate was recorded across eight periods. Findings: Participants exposed to high as compared to low expectations experienced faster heart rate prior to and during the gambling session. According to self-reports, it is the expectancy of winning money that is exciting, not playing the game. Conclusions: Regardless of the level of risk-taking, expectancy of winning is a cognitive factor influencing levels of arousal.

,Viewing An Ultra-Brief Chest Compression Only Video Improves Some Measures Of Bystander Cpr Performance And Responsiveness At A Mass Gathering Event,"Background CPR training at mass gathering events is an important part of health initiatives to improve cardiac arrest survival. However, it is unclear whether training lay bystanders using an ultra-brief video at a mass gathering event improves CPR quality and responsiveness. Objective To determine if showing a chest-compression only (CCO) Ultra-Brief Video (UBV) at a mass gathering event is effective in teaching lay bystanders CCO-CPR. Methods Prospective control trial in adults (age >18) who attended either a women's University of Arizona or a men's Phoenix Suns basketball game. Participants were evaluated using a standardized cardiac arrest scenario with Laerdal Skillreporter™ mannequins. CPR responsiveness (calling 911, time to calling 911, starting compressions within two minutes) and quality (compression rate, depth, hands-off time) were assessed for participants and data collected at Baseline and Post-intervention. Different participants were tested before and after the exposure of the UBV. Data were analyzed via the intention to treat principle using logistic regression for binary outcomes and median regression for continuous outcomes, controlling for clustering by venue. Results A total of 96 people were consented (Baseline = 45; Post intervention = 51). CPR responsiveness post intervention improved with faster time to calling 911 (s) and time to starting compressions (sec). Likewise, CPR quality improved with deeper compressions and improved hands-off time. Conclusions Showing a UBV at a mass gathering sporting event is associated with improved CPR responsiveness and performance for lay bystanders. This data provides further support for the use of mass media interventions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",doi,10.1016/j.resuscitation.2017.07.011,Scopus,Resuscitation,"Beskind D.L., Stolz U., Thiede R., Hoyer R., Robertson W., Brown J., Ludgate M., Tiutan T., Shane R., McMorrow D., Pleasants M., Kern K.B., Panchal A.R.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Violent Computer Games And Their Effects On State Hostility And Physiological Arousal,"An experimental study was conducted to investigate the impact of violent computer games on state hostility, state anxiety and arousal. Participants were undergraduate students, aged from 18 to 25 years old. Before the experimental sessions, participants filled in self-report measures concerning their video game habits and were also pre-tested for aggressiveness and trait anxiety. Physiological responses (heart rate and skin conductance) were measured during the experiment. After playing, information about state hostility and state anxiety was collected. The results showed that participants who played the violent game reported significantly higher state hostility and support the assumption that an aggressive personality moderates the effect of playing a violent game on state hostility. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",doi,10.1002/ab.20134,Scopus,Aggressive Behavior,"Arriaga P., Esteves F., Carneiro P., Monteiro M.B.",2006,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Violent Video Game Players And Non-Players Differ On Facial Emotion Recognition,"Violent video game playing has been associated with both positive and negative effects on cognition. We examined whether playing two or more hours of violent video games a day, compared to not playing video games, was associated with a different pattern of recognition of five facial emotions, while controlling for general perceptual and cognitive differences that might also occur. Undergraduate students were categorized as violent video game players (n=83) or non-gamers (n=69) and completed a facial recognition task, consisting of an emotion recognition condition and a control condition of gender recognition. Additionally, participants completed questionnaires assessing their video game and media consumption, aggression, and mood. Violent video game players recognized fearful faces both more accurately and quickly and disgusted faces less accurately than non-gamers. Desensitization to violence, constant exposure to fear and anxiety during game playing, and the habituation to unpleasant stimuli, are possible mechanisms that could explain these results. Future research should evaluate the effects of violent video game playing on emotion processing and social cognition more broadly. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",doi,10.1002/ab.21602,Scopus,Aggressive Behavior,"Diaz R.L., Wong U., Hodgins D.C., Chiu C.G., Goghari V.M.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali

It is now time to move beyond the question of whether violent media increase aggression to answering the question why violent media increase aggression. The present research tested whether violent video games produce a hostile expectation bias—the tendency to expect others to react to potential conflicts with aggression. Participants (N = 224) played either a violent or nonviolent video game. Next, they read ambiguous story stems about potential interpersonal conflicts. They were asked what the main character will do, say, think, and feel as the story continues. People who played a violent video game described the main character as behaving more aggressively, thinking more aggressive thoughts, and feeling more angry than did people who played a nonviolent video game.

,"Virtual Driving And Risk Taking: Do Racing Games Increase Risk-Taking Cognitions, Affect, And Behaviors?","Research has consistently shown that aggressive video console and PC games elicit aggressive cognitions, affect, and behaviors. Despite the increasing popularity of racing (driving) games, nothing is known about the psychological impact of this genre. This study investigated whether playing racing games affects cognitions, affect, and behaviors that can promote risk taking in actual road traffic situations. In Study 1, the authors found that the frequency of playing racing games was positively associated with competitive driving, obtrusive driving, and car accidents; a negative association with cautious driving was observed. To determine cause and effect, in Study 2, the authors manipulated whether participants played 1 of 3 racing games or 1 of 3 neutral games. Participants who played a racing game subsequently reported a higher accessibility of cognitions and affect positively associated with risk taking than did participants who played a neutral game. Finally, on a more behavioral level, in Study 3, the authors found that men who played a racing game subsequently took higher risks in computer-simulated critical road traffic situations than did men who played a neutral game.

,Virtual Patients In A Behavioral Medicine Massive Open Online Course (Mooc): A Qualitative And Quantitative Analysis Of Participants' Perceptions,"Objective: The purpose of this article is to explore learners' perceptions of using virtual patients in a behavioral medicine Massive Open Online Course (MOOCs) and thereby describe innovative ways of disseminating knowledge in health-related areas. Methods: A 5-week MOOC on behavioral medicine was hosted on the edX platform. The authors developed two branched virtual patients consisting of video recordings of a live standardized patient, with multiple clinical decision points and narration unfolding depending on learners' choices. Students interacted with the virtual patients to treat stress and sleep problems. Answers to the exit survey and participant comments from the discussion forum were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. Results: In total, 19,236 participants enrolled in the MOOC, out of which 740 received the final certificate. The virtual patients were completed by 2317 and 1640 participants respectively. Among survey respondents (n = 442), 83.1% agreed that the virtual patient exercise was helpful. The qualitative analysis resulted in themes covering what it was like to work with the virtual patient, with subthemes on learner-centered education, emotions/eustress, game comparisons, what the participants learned, what surprised them, how confident participants felt about applying interventions in practice, suggestions for improvement, and previous experiences of virtual patients. Conclusions: Students were enthusiastic about interacting with the virtual patients as a means to apply new knowledge about behavioral medicine interventions. The most common suggestion was to incorporate more interactive cases with various levels of complexity. Further research should include patient outcomes and focus on interprofessional aspects of learning with virtual patients in a MOOC. © 2017 The Author(s).",doi,10.1007/s40596-017-0706-4,Scopus,Academic Psychiatry,"Berman A.H., Biguet G., Stathakarou N., Westin-Hägglöf B., Jeding K., McGrath C., Zary N., Kononowicz A.A.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Virtual Player Design Using Self-Learning Via Competitive Coevolutionary Algorithms,"The Google Artificial Intelligence (AI) Challenge is an international contest the objective of which is to program the AI in a two-player real time strategy (RTS) game. This AI is an autonomous computer program that governs the actions that one of the two players executes during the game according to the state of play. The entries are evaluated via a competition mechanism consisting of two-player rounds where each entry is tested against others. This paper describes the use of competitive coevolutionary (CC) algorithms for the automatic generation of winning game strategies in Planet Wars, the RTS game associated with the 2010 contest. Three different versions of a prime algorithm have been tested. Their common nexus is not only the use of a Hall-of-Fame (HoF) to keep note of the winners of past coevolutions but also the employment of an archive of experienced players, termed the hall-of-celebrities (HoC), that puts pressure on the optimization process and guides the search to increase the strength of the solutions; their differences come from the periodical updating of the HoF on the basis of quality and diversity metrics. The goal is to optimize the AI by means of a self-learning process guided by coevolutionary search and competitive evaluation. An empirical study on the performance of a number of variants of the proposed algorithms is described and a statistical analysis of the results is conducted. In addition to the attainment of competitive bots we also conclude that the incorporation of the HoC inside the primary algorithm helps to reduce the effects of cycling caused by the use of HoF in CC algorithms. © Springer Science+Business Media 2014.",doi,10.1007/s11047-014-9411-3,Scopus,Natural Computing,"Nogueira Collazo M., Cotta C., Fernández-Leiva A.J.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali

,Wear Behavior Of Seven Artificial Resin Teeth Assessed With Three-Dimensional Measurements,"Statement of problem. Artificial resin teeth are widely used for removable dental prostheses because of their excellent properties. An evaluation of their wear behavior is important for predicting good clinical performance.Purpose. The purpose of the study was to examine the wear behavior of 7 different artificial resin teeth with 3-dimensional measurements.Material and methods. The artificial denture teeth tested were 2 composite resin teeth (Yamahachi PX, Huge Kaijing), 3 cross-linked acrylic resin teeth (Cosmo HXL, Premium 8, Vita Lingoform), and 2 conventional acrylic resin teeth (Yamahachi FX, Shengjian). The specimens were subjected to an abrasive tester for masticatory simulation. The wear loss (vertical loss and volume loss) was determined with a confocal laser scanning microscope. Data were analyzed with 1-way ANOVA followed by the Games-Howell post hoc test (α=.05).Results. The mean vertical loss and volume loss for all cross-linked acrylic resin teeth (0.987-1.03 μm, 0.858-0.939 mm3 × 10-3) were higher than for all composite resin teeth (0.636-0.698 μm, 0.507-0.650 mm3 × 10-3, P&lt;.001) but lower than those for conventional acrylic resin teeth Yamahachi FX and Shengjian (1.39 μm, 1.24 mm3 × 10-3; 12.1 μm, 16.4 mm3 × 10-3; P&lt;.001).

,Weather Risk Management At The Olympic Winter Games,"The globally celebrated Olympic Winter Games (OWG) are highly dependent on suitable snow and ice conditions to support elite-level competitions. To determine the range of weather impacts on the Games, this study examines the official Olympic post-Games reports from 1924 to 2010. Impacts include preparations for the Games, holding outdoor opening–closing ceremonies, outdoor sporting competitions, spectator comfort, transportation, and television broadcasts. The study also examines the range of historical adaptations that have developed to manage weather risks at the OWG. Three adaptation eras are identified, spanning the history of the games: emergent adaptation, technological transition, and advanced adaptation. Analysis reveals that while weather-induced impacts have always been a part of the Games, these impacts would be far greater if not for technical climatic adaptations. With the average daytime temperature of host locations steadily increasing from 0.4°C at the Games held in the 1920–1950s to 7.8°C at the Games held in the twenty-first century, it would be difficult to imagine recent host cities/regions successfully delivering the diverse Games programme exclusively on natural ice and snow. The connection between the evolving needs for weather risk management strategies by Olympic organisers and the growth of the Olympics in size and scope is also discussed. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",doi,10.1080/13683500.2014.887665,Scopus,Current Issues in Tourism,"Rutty M., Scott D., Steiger R., Johnson P.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,What Does Touch Tell Us About Emotions In Touchscreen-Based Gameplay,"The increasing number of people playing games on touch-screen mobile phones raises the question of whether touch behaviors reflect players' emotional states. This prospect would not only be a valuable evaluation indicator for game designers, but also for real-time personalization of the game experience. Psychology studies on acted touch behavior show the existence of discriminative affective profiles. In this article, finger-stroke features during gameplay on an iPod were extracted and their discriminative power analyzed. Machine learning algorithms were used to build systems for automatically discriminating between four emotional states (Excited, Relaxed, Frustrated, Bored), two levels of arousal and two levels of valence. Accuracy reached between 69% and 77% for the four emotional states, and higher results (~89%) were obtained for discriminating between two levels of arousal and two levels of valence. We conclude by discussing the factors relevant to the generalization of the results to applications other than games. © 2012 ACM.",doi,10.1145/2395131.2395138,Scopus,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,"Gao Y., Bianchi-Berthouze N., Meng H.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,"What Makes Good Games Go Viral? The Role Of Technology Use, Efficacy, Emotion And Enjoyment In Players' Decision To Share A Prosocial Digital Game","Serious digital games may be an effective tool for prosocial message dissemination because they offer technology and experiences that encourage players to share them with others, and spread virally. But little is known about the factors that predict players' willingness to share games with others in their social network. This panel study explores how several factors, including sharing technology use, emotional responses, and game enjoyment, contribute to players' decision to share the game Darfur is Dying, with others. College students played the game and completed questionnaires that assessed whether they had shared the games at two different time points: during game play and after game play. Positive emotions predicted sharing while students played the game, but negative emotions predicted whether the game was shared after initial game play. Game enjoyment predicted players' intentions to share the game, but it did not predict actual sharing behavior. Neither players' general use of sharing technologies nor their satisfaction related to sharing digital content predicted sharing intentions or behavior. These findings have implications for the study of viral social marketing campaigns, and serious game design and theory. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

,When To Measure Resting Values In Studies Of Children's Cardiovascular Reactivity,"Investigations suggesting that the order of obtaining resting and cardiovascular reactivity measurements moderates values have provided inconsistent results and have not analyzed data from children; the generalizability of results is uncertain. In this investigation, all children enrolled in the eighth-grade classrooms of the public schools of an entire county (n=451) participated in standardized reactivity assessments. The order of resting and reactivity measurements was randomized by examination day (a total of 19 days). Analyses indicated that all comparisons of order effects on mean resting blood pressure and heart rate, as well as reactivity (both change from resting and absolute values and both mean and maximal values), were nonsignificant. Results indicate that measurement order is not always a necessary consideration in studies of reactivity; the conditions under which measurement order is a consideration requires clarification. © 1994 Plenum Publishing Corporation.",doi,10.1007/BF01857922,Scopus,Journal of Behavioral Medicine,"Murphy J.K., Alpert B.S., Walker S.S.",1994,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Why Health Care Needs Design Research: Broadening The Perspective On Communication In Pediatric Care Through Play,"Today’s pediatric health care lacks methods to tap into the emotional state of hospitalized pediatric patients (age 4-6 years). The most frequently used approaches were developed for adults and fail to acknowledge the importance of imaginary experiences and the notion of play that may appeal to children. The scope of this article is to introduce a new design-oriented method of gathering information about the emotional state of pediatric patients using an experimental computer game called the Child Patient game (CPgame). The CPgame was developed at a Danish hospital, and the results of the preliminary tests show that games could serve as a system in which children are willing to express their emotions through play. The results are based on two comparative analyses of the CPgame through which it is possible to identify three different types of players among the patients playing the game. Furthermore, the data reveal that pediatric patients display a radically different play pattern than children who are not in hospital. The inquiry takes an interdisciplinary approach; it has obvious health care-related objectives and seeks to meet the urgent need for new methods within health care to optimize communication with young children. At the same time, design research (i.e., the development of new knowledge through the development of a new design) heavily impacts the method. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",doi,10.1080/10410236.2014.917220,Scopus,Health Communication,"Knutz E., Ammentorp J., Kofoed P.-E.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Why Is It Taking So Long To Secure Internet Routing?,"The border gateway protocol (BGP) is the glue that holds the Internet together, enabling data communications between large networks operated by different organizations. The answer to this question lies in the fact that BGP is a global protocol, running across organizational and national borders. As such, it lacks a single centralized authority that can mandate the deployment of a security solution; instead, every organization can autonomously decide which routing security solutions it will deploy in its own network. Thus, the deployment becomes a coordination game among thousands of independently operated networks; this is further complicated by the fact that many security solutions do not work well unless a large number of networks deploy them.",doi,10.1145/2659899,Scopus,Communications of the ACM,Goldberg S.,2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,"Work Content Influences On Cognitive Task Load, Emotional State And Performance During A Simulated 520-Days' Mars Mission","In high-risk domains such as human space flight, cognitive performances can be negatively affected by emotional responses to events and conditions in their working environment (e.g., isolation and health incidents). The COgnitive Performance and Error (COPE) model distinguishes effects of work content on cognitive task load and emotional state, and their effect on the professional's performance. This paper examines the relationships between these variables for a simulated Mars-mission. Six volunteers (well-educated and -motivated men) were isolated for 520 days in a simulated spacecraft in which they had to execute a (virtual) mission to Mars. As part of this mission, every other week, several computer tasks were performed. These tasks consisted of a negotiation game, a chat-based learning activity and an entertainment game. Before and after these tasks, and after post-task questionnaires, the participants rated their emotional state consisting of arousal, valence and dominance, and their cognitive task load consisting of level of information processing, time occupied and task-set switches. Results revealed significant differences between cognitive task load and emotional state levels when work content varied. Significant regression models were also found that could explain variation in task performance. These findings contribute to the validation of the COPE model and suggest that differences in appraisals for tasks may bring about different emotional states and task performances. © 2015 The Authors.

,Worldcupinion: Experiences With An Android App For Real-Time Opinion Sharing During Soccer World Cup Games,"Mobile devices are increasingly used in social networking applications and research. So far, there is little work on real-time emotion or opinion sharing in large loosely coupled user communities. One potential area of application is the assessment of widely broadcasted television (TV) shows. The idea of connecting non-collocated TV viewers via telecommunication technologies is referred to as Social TV. Such systems typically include set-top boxes for supporting the collaboration. In this work the authors investigated whether mobile phones can be used as an additional channel for sharing opinions, emotional responses, and TV-related experiences in real-time. To gain insight into this area, an Android app was developed for giving real-time feedback during soccer games and to create ad hoc fan groups. This paper presents results on rating activity during games and discusses experiences with deploying this app over four weeks during soccer World Cup. In doing so, challenges and opportunities faced are highlighted and an outlook on future work in this area is given.

,Xbox Kinect™ Represents High Intensity Exercise For Adults With Cystic Fibrosis,"Background: Exercise is important for patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Interactive gaming consoles are a new trend in exercise. This study sought to determine the exercise intensity of training using the Xbox Kinect™. Methods: Participants with CF completed two sessions separated by ≤ 10 days. The first session involved a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) to measure peak exercise capacity. The second session involved 20. min of exercise using the Xbox Kinect™. Results: Ten participants (median [interquartile range] FEV1 58 [46]%, 29 [6] years, 6 males) completed the study. The average heart rate over the final 10min of exercise using the Xbox Kinect™, expressed as a percentage of the peak heart rate achieved on the CPET, was 86% (95% confidence interval, 81 to 92%). Conclusions: Training using the Xbox Kinect™ represents high intensity exercise for adults with CF and may be a suitable alternative to conventional exercise modalities. © 2013 European Cystic Fibrosis Society.",doi,10.1016/j.jcf.2013.05.005,Scopus,Journal of Cystic Fibrosis,"Holmes H., Wood J., Jenkins S., Winship P., Lunt D., Bostock S., Hill K.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Young Adults’ Media Use And Attitudes Toward Interpersonal And Institutional Forms Of Aggression.,"Links between media violence exposure and favorable attitudes toward interpersonal violence are well established, but few studies have examined whether associations extend to include favorable attitudes toward institutional forms of aggression. Studies on this topic have not assessed multiple forms of media use and statistically controlled for individual characteristics likely to influence attitudes beyond sociodemographic information. In this study, undergraduate students (N=319) aged 18–20 years (56% male) completed a survey assessing media use (number of hours per week spent playing videogames, watching movies/TV shows, watching TV sports) and attitudes toward interpersonal violence, punitive criminal justice policies, and different types of military activities (preparedness/defense and aggressive intervention). Greater number of hours spent watching TV contact sports was associated with more favorable attitudes toward military preparedness/defense, aggressive military intervention, and punitive criminal justice policies among men independently of parental education, lifetime violence exposure within the home and community, aggressive personality, and constrained problem solving style. Greater number of hours spent watching violent movies/TV was associated with more favorable attitudes toward military preparedness/defense among men and with more favorable attitudes toward interpersonal violence and punitive criminal justice policies among women, but these associations became non-significant when adjusting for covariates.

,'Resting Toucher': A Time And Motion Analysis Of Elite Lawn Bowls.,"Whilst numerous investigations have explored the physical demands placed upon competitive sportspeople from a wide array of sports little is known about the physical demands placed on lawn bowlers. The purpose of this study was to ascertain the movement activities of Australian representative singles and pairs players and to determine the frequency and duration of these activities. One match each of two male and two female players (one singles and one pairs player per gender) were videotaped during an international tournament. During playback of the videotaped matches (n = 4), a single observer coded the players' activities into five distinct categories (waiting, walking forward, walking backward, jogging and bowling) using a computerised video editing system (Gamebreaker™ Digital Video Analysis System). Field calibration of players over 30m for forward motions and 15m for the backward motion was performed to allow for the estimation of total distance covered during the match. Heart rate was monitored during each match. The duration of a match was found to be (mean ± SD) 1hr 28 ± 15mins. The total distance covered during each match was 2093 ± 276m. The mean percentage of match time spent in each motion was: waiting, 61.8 ± 9.3%; walking forward, 22.3 ± 5.6%; walking backward, 2.0 ± 0.4%; jogging, 1.1 ± 0.5%; and bowling, 8.5 ± 4.2%. Average heart rate was found to be 57 ± 7% of age-predicted HRmax with a maximum of 78 ± 9% of age-predicted HRmax. The results of this study suggest that playing lawn bowls at an international level requires light-moderate intensity activity similar to that reported for golf. Key PointsThe duration of a lawn bowls match played in sets play was 1hr 28 ± 15mins.The majority (65%) of this time was spent in the motion category ""waiting"".Players covered more than 2000m during a match with the vast majority (85%) in the form of forward walking.The average heart rate was 107 ± 15 bpm or 57 ± 7% of age-predicted HRmax.The game of lawn bowls requires light-moderate intensity activity and appears to be similar to the physical demands of golf.",pmid,24357953,pubmed,Journal of sports science &amp; medicine,"Silk, Aaron J; Hammond, John; Weatherby, Robert P",2013,NA,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,"""Survivor"" Torches ""Who Wants To Be A Physician?"" In The Educational Games Ratings War","We recently developed an educational game for reviewing respiratory physiology in a large classroom. The ""Who Wants to be a Physician?"" game encouraged medical students to be active participants in the learning process. An evaluation of the game documented that students enjoyed the active format, and the students reported that the game enhanced their ability to understand and retain information. However, the evaluation also revealed that the game had limitations. Specifically, the students recommended the use of multiple-choice questions to match the Medical Board Examination format and to speed up the game (i.e., cover more topics). The students also wanted to increase their level of participation and interaction. Finally, we wanted to emphasize the benefits of peer instruction as a collaborative learning tool. To address these limitations, we designed a new game, ""Survivor."" Survivor incorporated multiple-choice questions and emphasized peer instruction and a capacity to gather information and solve novel problems. In addition, participation was increased by including the student audience in the game. Finally, an evaluation instrument was utilized to assess the effectiveness of this instructional tool in an academic setting. As a result of these improvements, the evaluation documents that the newly developed tool is a more effective educational game that couples fun and creative excitement with proven and effective educational concepts.",pmid,11850325,Scopus,American Journal of Physiology - Advances in Physiology Education,"Howard M.G., Collins H.L., DiCarlo S.E.",2002,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,[Association Between Level Of Intelligence And Heart Rate Variability].,Earlier we discovered that heart rate variability was associated with the level of intelligence. The purpose of this study is to confirm this association using more reliable method and to define more precisely the frequency band within which the amplitude of the heart rate modulations is related to intelligence. 13 males (aged 14 to 17) were the study subjects. The total score of the computer game Tetris was taken as a general measure of the intelligence level. Heart rate was recorded electrocardiographically both at rest and during playing Tetris. Frequency analysis of heart rate was carried out with digital Fourier transformation. Correlation analysis showed that there was positive association between the level of intelligence and the amplitude of heart rate modulation at the frequencies 0.30 and 0.15 modulations per RR interval. This association is closer for the heart rate at rest than for the heart rate during mental work and for the frequency 0.30 than for the 0.15 modulations per RR interval.,pmid,21961308,pubmed,Rossiiskii fiziologicheskii zhurnal imeni I.M.

,Computerised Biofeedback Games: A New Method For Teaching Stress Management And Its Use In Irritable Bowel Syndrome,"Objectives: To develop and test a computer biofeedback game designed to teach deep relaxation to patients with a stress related disorder and to assess whether relaxation can improve symptomatic episodes. ■ Study design and setting: An open, prospective, single centre study. Department of Gastroenterology, Royal Free Hospital, London. ■ Subjects: Forty patients with irritable bowel syndrome refractory to conventional medical treatment. ■ Main outcome measures: Development of a computer aided biofeedback apparatus directed at the gut for teaching relaxation to patients with irritable bowel syndrome. The patients' ability to complete a computer game involving biofeedback modulated by a physiological loop that related changes in stress (monitored by electrodermal activity) to animated computer graphics. The degree to which deep relaxation was achieved was measured numerically by a progressive reduction in the sensitivity level of the biofeedback loop. The success of relaxation in ameliorating physical symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome was assessed by daily diaries in which global and weighted bowel symptom scores were entered. ■ Results: A computer biofeedback game based on animated gut imagery was successfully developed. Most patients learned to achieve progressively deeper levels of relaxation after four 30 minute biofeedback sessions (mean difference in sensitivity level 2.0 (95% confidence interval 0.96 to 2.93), p<0.001). Use of 'dosed' relaxation when bowel symptoms were troublesome was helpful in 50% of patients. It reduced the global symptom score (mean difference 0.5 (0.02 to 0.32), p<0.04) and the bowel symptom score (mean difference 0.8 (0.04 to 1.58), p<0.04). At long term follow up, 64% of patients who had been helped by dosed relaxation continued to use the technique, although they had had no further contact with the hospital. ■ Conclusions: This computer biofeedback game taught deep relaxation rapidly and effectively. Half the patients with refractory irritable bowel syndrome found the technique helpful on most occasions on which it was used. Computer biofeedback games may offer a simple, inexpensive strategy for managing other stress related medical disorders.",pmid,9881312,Scopus,Journal of the Royal College of Physicians of London,"Leahy A., Clayman C., Mason I., Lloyd G., Epstein O.",1998,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,"Dependence Of Young Female Volleyballers' Performance On Their Body Build, Physical Abilities, And Psycho-Physiological Properties","Aim. The aim of the study was to establish which anthropometric characteristics, physical abilities and psycho-physiological properties determine the success of adolescent female volleyballers at competitions. Methods. For this purpose we studied 32 female volleyballers aged 13-16 years. The anthropometric examination included 43 measurements, 7 tests of physical fitness, and 4 series of computerised psycho-physiological tests (n=21). The Performance of game elements was measured empirically during championship games using the original computer program ""Game"". Results. The proficiency of performing volleyball elements-serve, reception, feint, block and spike - was calculated by regression models from the 14 anthropometric measurements, 4 physical fitness and 7 psychophysiological test results, which showed significant correlation with proficiency in the game. The predictive power of the models was at least 32 % and in average 56%. The anthropometric factor was significant in the performance of all the elements of the game, being most essential (71-83 %) for attack, block and feint. Good results in physical ability tests granted success in serve, attack and reception. Conclusion. It was possible to predict the efficiency of reception (44 %) by endurance, flexibility and speed measuring tests. Medicine ball throwing test was essential for attack (22%). Psycho-physiological tests were significant for the performance of block (98 %), attack (80 %), feint (60 %) and reception (39 %).",pmid,14625509,Scopus,Journal of Sports Medicine and Physical Fitness,"Stamm R., Veldre G., Stamm M., Thomson K., Kaarma H., Loko J., Koskel S.",2003,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Determinants Of Retinal Vascular Abnormalities In Children And Adolescents With Essential Hypertension,"The predictors of retinal vascular abnormalities in patients with elevated BP have not been studied extensively in children or adults. The purpose of this study was to investigate potential correlates of arteriolar narrowing, tortuosity and arteriovenous nicking in a population of children and adolescents with essential hypertension. A total of 97 subjects, aged 6-23 years, were studied. Retinal vascular abnormalities were determined by photographs of the optic fundus which were interpreted independently by two opthalmologists. In 50 subjects (51%) there were one or more abnormalities. Potential correlates of retinal abnormalities included: (1) demographic factors, (2) body size, (3) level of BP and duration of hypertension, (4) family history of cardiovascular disease, (5) treatment with antihypertensive medication, (6) dietary sodium intake, (7) laboratory analyses, (8) the reactivity of BP and heart rate to playing a video game, and (9) cardiovascular reactivity to exercise. Using stepwise multiple logistic regression, the variables that were independently associated with the presence of retinal vascular abnormalities were family income, dietary sodium intake, fasting blood glucose, pulse pressure during mental stress and the change in SBP from rest to maximum exercise. In addition, subjects with more than one retinal vascular abnormality had higher average DBP during follow-up in the Hypertension Clinic and a smaller rise in SBP from rest to maximum exercise. Identification of these independent predictors of retinal vascular abnormalities and factors associated with more than one abnormality may provide insight into the pathogenesis of hypertensive vascular disease.",pmid,8345488,Scopus,Journal of Human Hypertension,"Daniels S.R., Lipman M.J., Burke M.J., Loggie J.M.H.",1993,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Effectiveness Of An Upper Extremity Exercise Device Integrated With Computer Gaming For Aerobic Training In Adolescents With Spinal Cord Dysfunction,"Background/Objective: To determine whether a new upper extremity exercise device integrated with a video game (GameCycle) requires sufficient metabolic demand and effort to induce an aerobic training effect and to explore the feasibility of using this system as an exercise modality in an exercise intervention. Design: Pre-post intervention. Setting: University-based research facility. Subject Population: A referred sample of 8 adolescent subjects with spina bifida (4 girls, 15.5 ± 0.6 years; 4 boys 17.5 ± 0.9 years) was recruited to participate in the project. All subjects had some level of mobility impairment that did not allow them to participate in mainstream sports available to their nondisabled peers. Five subjects used a wheelchair full time, one used a wheelchair occasionally, but walked with forearm crutches, and 2 were fully ambulatory, but had impaired gait. Main Outcome Measures: Peak oxygen uptake, maximum work output, aerobic endurance, peak heart rate, rating of perceived exertion, and user satisfaction. Results: Six of the 8 subjects were able to reach a Vo2 of at least 50% of their Vo2 reserve while using the GameCycle. Seven of the 8 subjects reached a heart rate of at least 50% of their heart rate reserve. One subject did not reach either 50% of Vo2 reserve or 50% of heart rate reserve. Seven of the 8 subjects increased their maximum work capability after training with the GameCycle at least 3 times per week for 16 weeks. Conclusions: The data suggest that the GameCycle seems to be adequate as an exercise device to improve oxygen uptake and maximum work capability in adolescents with lower extremity disability caused by spinal cord dysfunction.

,Efficacy Of Nitrendipine As Baseline Antihypertensive Therapy,"To determine whether calcium antagonists might be used alternatively to β-blockers in antihypertensive therapy, we investigated if monotherapy with oxprenolol (160-320 mg/day) and nitrendipine (20-40 mg/day) were equally effective on clinical casual blood pressure (BP), ambulatory BP monitoring (Remler), and BP during mental challenge (video game). In a prospective randomized long-term study, 60 white male civil servants (mean ± SD = 43 ± 6 years) with mild essential hypertension only were treated for at least 4 months. Average BP before therapy was 149 ± 11/97 ± 11 mm Hg. The antihypertensive effect was not different between the two groups (19/14 versus 21/12 mm Hg). Both groups did not differ in BP at rest, in BP during mental challenge (141 ± 7/109 ± 5 versus 146 ± 9/112 ± 8 mm Hg, NS), and average ambulatory BP monitoring at work (122 ± 12/81 ± 17 versus 132 ± 14/79 ± 17 mmHg, NS), which was identical with the clinical casual BP. Thus, nitrendipine can effectively be used in long-term baseline antihypertensive monotherapy. © 1984 Raven Press, New York.",pmid,6085365,Scopus,Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology,"Rüddel H., Schmieder R., Langewitz W., Neus J., Wagner O., von Eiff A.W.",1984,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali

,Ethnicity And Socioeconomic Status: Impact On Cardiovascular Activity At Rest And During Stress In Youth With A Family History Of Hypertension,"Objective: The purpose of the present study was to examine the potential interaction of ethnicity and SES on hemodynamic functioning at rest and during acute stress in normotensive adolescents with a family history of essential hypertension (EH). Design: The influences of ethnicity and socioeconomic status (SES) on cardiovascular function were evaluated at rest and in response to five different laboratory stressors. Methods: 110 (50 female) Caucasian and 162 (85 female) African-American normotensive youth (initial age 11.2 ± 2.4 years) with a family history of essential hypertension (EH) were tested on two occasions, an average of 2.5 years apart. Based on previous findings, it was predicted that African Americans, particularly those of low SES, would exhibit higher resting blood pressure (BP) and greater cardiovascular reactivity to acute laboratory stressors than would Caucasians. Results: As predicted, African-American youth exhibited higher resting diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and total peripheral resistance (TPR) than Caucasians on both visits (both Ps<.04). African Americans exhibited greater systolic blood pressure (SBP) reactivity than did Caucasians to the video game stressor during both lab visits (both Ps<.02) and greater heart rate reactivity during the first lab visit (P<.01). African Americans exhibited greater SBP and/or DBP, and TPR reactivity to the cold pressor during the first lab visit and the parent-child discussion during the second visit (all Ps<.03). Conclusion: As predicted, African Americans exhibited higher resting BP and TPR, and greater cardiovascular reactivity than Caucasians. Although not in the predicted direction, a pattern of interactions began to emerge on the second evaluation. For example, upper SES youth exhibited greater heart rate reactivity compared to all other groups on the social competence interview and parent-child discussion stressors. Further study is needed to clarify the role cardiovascular reactivity may play in the link between ethnicity, SES, and cardiovascular disease risk.

A complete history should address any concerns from the patient and family and screen for lifestyle habits, including diet, physical activity, daily screen time (e.g., television, computer, video games), hours of sleep per night, dental care, and safety habits. School performance can be used for developmental surveillance. A full physical examination should be performed; however, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends against routine scoliosis screening and testicular examination. Children should be screened for obesity, which is defined as a body mass index at or above the 95th percentile for age and sex, and resources for comprehensive, intensive behavioral interventions should be provided to children with obesity. Although the evidence is mixed regarding screening for hypertension before 18 years of age, many experts recommend checking blood pressure annually beginning at three years of age. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends vision and hearing screening annually or every two years in school-aged children. There is insufficient evidence to recommend screening for dyslipidemia in children of any age, or screening for depression before 12 years of age. All children should receive at least 400 IU of vitamin D daily, with higher doses indicated in children with vitamin D deficiency. Children who live in areas with inadequate fluoride in the water (less than 0.6 ppm) should receive a daily fluoride supplement. Age-appropriate immunizations should be given, as well as any missed immunizations. © 2011 American Academy of Family Physicians.",pmid,21404978,Scopus,American Family Physician,"Riley M., Locke A.B., Skye E.P.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,"Immediate Effects Of Labetalol On Central, Splanchnic-Hepatic, And Forearm Haemodynamics During Pleasant Emotional Stress In Hypertensive Patients.","The effects of intravenous administration of labetalol in a dose of 0.75 mg/kg body weight on central, splanchnic-hepatic and forearm haemodynamics were studied in 8 hypertensive patients resting in the supine position and during pleasant psychic stress induced by practice of a television-game of tennis. In the resting state labetalol caused immediate reduction of arterial blood pressures and of total vascular resistance, whereas heart rate, cardiac output and splanchnic-hepatic and forearm blood flow remained unchanged. After labetalol, the stress-induced increase in heart rate, cardiac output, estimated myocardial oxygen demand and forearm blood flow was significantly reduced, whereas total vascular resistance and splanchnic-hepatic vascular resistance remained unchanged. This is taken to indicate that the alpha-adrenoceptor blocking properties of labetalol may offer haemodynamic advantages as compared to the widely used non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents in the management of hypertension.",pmid,7433341,Scopus,Postgraduate Medical Journal,"Trap-Jensen J., Clausen J.P., Hartling O.J., Svendsen T.L., Krogsgaard A.R.",1980,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Impaired Pressure Natriuresis In Obese Youths,"Objective: To compare the response and recovery of blood pressure (BP) and sodium excretion (UNaV) in response to a behavioral stressor in overweight/obese and lean adolescents. Research Methods and Procedures: Twenty-five lean (12% to 20% body fat) and 59 overweight/obese (&gt;25% body fat) normotensive adolescents were provided all meals for 3 days (average sodium intake, 4000 ± 200 mg/d), before performing the stressor on the third day. There was a 2-hour pre-stress rest, followed by a 1-hour stress (involving a video game task), and a 2-hour recovery. Percentage of body fat was obtained from DXA. UNaV was measured hourly, whereas systolic BP and diastolic BP measurements were obtained at 15-minute intervals, and averaged for each 1-hour period. Results: There was no significant difference between the lean and overweight/obese group for the response of systolic BP and diastolic BP (group by time interaction, p = 0.60 and p = 0.64, respectively). However, the lean group had a significantly greater increase in UNaV in response to the stressor compared with the overweight/obese group (p = 0.02). UNaV remained elevated compared with baseline in both groups at the 1-hour (p &lt; 0.0001) and 2-hour (p ≤ 0.0001) post-time points. Furthermore, there was a tendency for a larger number of sodium retainers in the overweight/obese group compared with the lean group (39.0% vs. 20.0%; χ2 = 2.85, df = 1, p = 0.09). Discussion: This study provided evidence that sodium regulation was impaired during a behavioral stress in overweight/obese individuals compared with lean individuals.

,Influence Of Fatigue On Tackling Technique In Rugby League Players,"This study investigated the influence of fatigue on tackling technique in rugby league players and determined the relationship between selected physiological capacities and fatigue-induced decrements in tackling technique. Eight rugby league players underwent a standardized one-on-one tackling drill in a 10-m grid. Players performed the one-on-one tackling drill before strenuous exercise and following game-specific repeated-effort exercise of progressively increasing intensities (corresponding to moderate, heavy, and very heavy intensity) in order to induce fatigue that was representative of match conditions. Video footage was taken from the rear, side, and front of the defending player. Tackling technique was objectively assessed using standardized technical criteria. In addition, all players underwent measurements of standard anthropometry (height, body mass, and sum of 7 skinfold measurements), speed (10-, 20-, and 40-m sprint), muscular power (vertical jump), agility (L run), and estimated maximal aerobic power (V̇o2max multistage fitness test). A progressive increase in total repeated-effort time, heart rate, blood lactate concentration, and ratings of perceived exertion occurred throughout the repeated-effort protocol, demonstrating a progressive increase in intensity and fatigue. Fatigue resulted in progressive reductions in tackling technique. Players with the best tackling technique in a nonfatigued state demonstrated the greatest decrement in tackling technique under fatigued conditions. In addition, a significant association was observed between estimated V̇o 2max (r= -0.62) and agility (r= 0.68) and fatigue-induced decrements in tackling technique. From a practical perspective, these findings suggest that strength and conditioning programs designed to develop endurance, change of direction speed, and anticipation skills may reduce fatigue-induced decrements in tackling technique. Furthermore, any defensive drills designed to improve tackling technique should be performed before and under fatigue. © 2008 National Strength and Conditioning Association.",pmid,18550983,Scopus,Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research,Gabbett T.J.,2008,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Isolated Core Vs. Superficial Cooling Effects On Virtual Maze Navigation,"Introduction: Cold impairs cognitive performance and is a common occurrence in many survival situations. Altered behavior patterns due to impaired navigation abilities in cold environments are potential problems in lost-person situations. We investigated the separate effects of low core temperature and superficial cooling on a spatially demanding virtual navigation task. Methods: There were 12 healthy men who were passively cooled via 15°C water immersion to a core temperature of 36.0°C, then transferred to a warm (40°C) water bath to eliminate superficial shivering while completing a series of 20 virtual computer mazes. In a control condition, subjects rested in a thermoneutral (∼35°C) bath for a time-matched period before being transferred to a warm bath for testing. Superficial cooling and distraction were achieved by whole-body immersion in 35°C water for a time-matched period, followed by lower leg immersion in 10°C water for the duration of the navigational tests. Results: Mean completion time and mean error scores for the mazes were not significantly different (p > 0.05) across the core cooling (16.59 ± 11.54 s, 0.91 ± 1.86 errors), control (15.40 ± 8.85 s, 0.82 ± 1.76 errors), and superficial cooling (15.19 ± 7.80 s, 0.77 ± 1.40 errors) conditions. Discussion: Separately reducing core temperature or increasing cold sensation in the lower extremities did not influence performance on virtual computer mazes, suggesting that navigation is more resistive to cooling than other, simpler cognitive tasks. Further research is warranted to explore navigational ability at progressively lower core and skin temperatures, and in different populations.

,Match Analysis And Temporal Patterns Of Fatigue In Rugby Sevens,"Granatelli, G, Gabbett, TJ, Briotti, G, Padulo, J, Buglione, A, D'Ottavio, S, and Ruscello, BM. Match analysis and temporal patterns of fatigue in rugby sevens. J Strength Cond Res 28 (3): 728-734, 2014-Rugby sevens is a rapidly growing sport. Match analysis is increasingly being used by sport scientists and coaches to improve the understanding of the physical demands of this sport. This study investigated the physical and physiological demands of elite men's rugby sevens, with special reference to the temporal patterns of fatigue during match play. Nine players, 4 backs and 5 forwards (age 25.1 6 3.1 years) participated during 2 ""Roma 7s"" international tournaments (2010 and 2011). All the players were at the professional level in the highest Italian rugby union, and 5 of these players also competed at the international level. During the matches (n = 15), the players were filmed to assess game performance. Global positioning system, heart rate (HR), and blood lactate (BLa) concentration data were measured and analyzed. The mean total distance covered throughout matches was 1,221 ± 118 m (first half = 643 ± 70 m and second half = 578 ± 77 m; with a decrease of 11.2%, p ≥ 0.05, Effect Size [ES] = 0.29). The players achieved 88.3 ± 4.2 and 87.7 ± 3.4% of the HRmax during the first and second halves, respectively. The BLa for the first and second halves was 3.9 ± 0.9 and 11.2 ± 1.4 mmol.L -1, respectively. The decreases in performance occurred consistently in the final 3 minutes of the matches (240.5% in the distance covered per minute). The difference found in relation to the playing position, although not statistically significant (p = 0.11), showed a large ES (n2 = 0.20), suggesting possible practical implications. These results demonstrate that rugby sevens is a demanding sport that places stress on both the anaerobic glycolytic and aerobic oxidative energy systems. Strength and conditioning programs designed to train these energy pathways may prevent fatigue-induced reductions in physical performance. © 2014 National Strength and Conditioning Association.",pmid,23722109,Scopus,Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research,"Granatelli G., Gabbett T.J., Briotti G., Padulo J., Buglione A., D'ottavio S., Ruscello B.M.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali

,Movie Magic In The Clinic: Computer-Generated Characters For Automated Health Counseling.,"In this presentation, I demonstrate how many of the technologies used in movie special effects and games have been successfully used in health education and behavior change interventions. Computer-animated health counselors simulate human face-to-face dialogue as a computer interface medium, including not only verbal behavior but nonverbal conversational behavior such as hand gesture, body posture shifts, and facial display of emotion. This technology has now been successfully used in a wide range of health interventions for education and counseling of patients and consumers, including applications in physical activity promotion, medication adherence, and hospital discharge. These automated counselors have been deployed on home computers, hospital-based touch screen kiosks, and mobile devices with integrated health behavior sensing capability. Development of these agents is an interdisciplinary endeavor spanning the fields of character modeling and animation, computational linguistics, artificial intelligence, health communication and behavioral medicine. I will give demonstrations of several fielded systems, describe the technologies and methodologies underlying their development, and present results from five randomized controlled trials that have been completed or are in progress.",pmid,18999232,Scopus,AMIA ...

,Pet Studies Of The Effects Of Aerobic Exercise On Human Striatal Dopamine Release,"In vivo microdialysis studies have shown that exercise increases the concentration of dopamine (DA) in the striatum of the rat brain. It has also been shown that PET with [11C]raclopride can be used to assess changes in brain DA induced by drugs and by performance tasks such as playing a video game. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of exercise (treadmill running) on striatal DA release in the human brain. Methods: Twelve healthy volunteers (5 women, 7 men; mean age, 32 ± 5 y; age range, 25-40 y) with a history of regular exercise received 2 PET scans with [11C]raclopride on 2 separate days, 1 at baseline and 1 at 5-10 min after running on a treadmill for 30 min. The speed and inclination of the treadmill were increased gradually to reach a maximal speed of 9.7 km/h (6 mph) and a maximal inclination of 10°. Data were acquired on a Siemens HR+ scanner in 3-dimensional mode for 60 min. Heart rates and electrocardiograms were monitored. DA D2 receptor availability was measured using the ratio of the distribution volume in the putamen to that in the cerebellum, which is a function of the number of available binding sites/dissociation constant. Results: The subjects ran at an average speed of 8.7 ± 0.5 km/h (5.4 ± 0.3 mph) and at an inclination of 3.3°± 2°. The maximum effort of running was maintained for 10-15 min. The heart rates of the subjects were increased by 143% ± 47%. DA D2 receptor availability in the putamen after treadmill running (4.22 ± 0.34) was no different from that of baseline (4.17 ± 0.29; P &lt; 0.6). Conclusion: No significant changes in synaptic DA concentration were detected, although the subjects exercised vigorously for 30 min.",pmid,10945526,Scopus,Journal of Nuclear Medicine,"Wang G.-J., Volkow N.D., Fowler J.S., Franceschi D., Logan J., Pappas N.R., Wong C.T., Netusil N.",2e3,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Physical Load Imposed On Soccer Players During Small-Sided Training Games,"Aim. The aim of this study was to examine the kinematical, physiological and technical load imposed on soccer players during three typical small-sided 3-a-side training games carried out in an artificial grass 33×20 m surface. Methods. Kinematic analysis was carried out with a bidimen-sional photogrammetric video system. Heart rate was recorded at 5 s intervals using Polar Accurex Plus heart rate monitors and expressed in relation to individual maximal heart rate (HRmax). Technical parameters were registered using a specifically designed notation sheet. Results. The overall intensity of these three small-sided games was superior than the experienced during competitive matches. Distance covered (747-749 vs 638 m) and mean heart rate (173 vs 166 b·min-1) were higher (P&lt;0.05) in the drills without goalkeepers. The inclusion of goalkeepers reduced the tempo of the game as players performed less (P&lt;0.05) high-intensity running and increased (P&lt;0.05) low-intensity activities. Time spent exercising at intensities between 76-85 % HRmax was lower (P&lt;0.05) in the game without goals, whereas the presence of goalkeepers reduced (P&lt;0.05) activities performed exceeding 86% HRmax. Conclusion. The results of this study suggest that small-sided games can be used effectively to develop the specific endurance capacity of football players. The integration of these drills by coaches during the regular training schedule can help replicating the demands experienced during real match-play.",pmid,18427410,Scopus,Journal of Sports Medicine and Physical Fitness,"Mallo J., Navarro E.",2008,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Prevalence Of Overweight In High School Students With Special Reference To Cardiovascular Efficiency.,"In India, malnutrition has two ends. Under nutrition attracted the focus of health workers, as it is more prevalent. But over the past few years, childhood obesity is increasingly being observed with the changing lifestyle of families with increased purchasing power, increasing hours of inactivity due to television, video games and computers have replaced outdoor games and other social activities. Globally, an estimated 10% of school-aged children, between 5 and 17 years of age, are overweight and obese. Obesity can be seen as first wave of a defined cluster of non-communicable diseases called ""New World Syndrome"" creating an enormous socio-economic and public health burden in poorer countries. The most important consequence of childhood obesity is its persistence into adulthood with all its health risks like dyslipidemia, hyper-insulinemia, cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, osteoarthritis, gall bladder disease, hypertension and some sex hormone- sensitive cancers. The present study was, therefore, undertaken to determine the prevalence of overweight in high school students and to study the association between Body Mass Index (BMI) and cardiovascular efficiency. A school based cross sectional study was conducted in 2 schools of Nagpur. The total number of students included in the study was 565. Student's complete information regarding profile was taken in pretested questionnaire format after taking informed consent of parents. The anthropometric measurements of the students were done. Student's height and weight were measured and BMI was calculated. The student's cardiovascular efficiency was assessed with the help of Harvard step test. The data was analyzed using Epi info version 3.4.1 software. Chi-square test was used as test of significance and p value less than 0.05 was considered as significant. 90.97% students belonged to 13, 14 and 15 years of age group. majority of the students belong to 14 years (33.81), followed by 13 years (33.27) and 15 years (23.89) of age group respectively. The prevalence of overweight in students was 5.84% and obesity was 0.35%. The combined prevalence of overweight and obesity was 6.19%. The prevalence of overweight in boys is 5.31% and obesity was 0.63% and that in girls is 6.53% and 0% respectively. The association between Harvard step test and overweight was found to be statistically significant (p&lt; 0.000001). The total prevalence of overweight and obesity was 6.19%. The association between Harvard step test and overweight was found to be statistically significant (p&lt; 0.000001).",pmid,22980162,Scopus,Global journal of health science,"Deoke A., Hajare S., Saoji A.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Recognition Of Physical Activities In Overweight Hispanic Youth Using Knowme Networks,"Background: KNOWME Networks is a wireless body area network with 2 triaxial accelerometers, a heart rate monitor, and mobile phone that acts as the data collection hub. One function of KNOWME Networks is to detect physical activity (PA) in overweight Hispanic youth. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the in-laboratory recognition accuracy of KNOWME. Methods: Twenty overweight Hispanic participants (10 males; age 14.6 ± 1.8 years), underwent 4 data collection sessions consisting of 9 activities/session: lying down, sitting, sitting fidgeting, standing, standing fidgeting, standing playing an active video game, slow walking, brisk walking, and running. Data were used to train activity recognition models. The accuracy of personalized and generalized models is reported. Results: Overall accuracy for personalized models was 84%. The most accurately detected activity was running (96%). The models had difficulty distinguishing between the static and fidgeting categories of sitting and standing. When static and fidgeting activity categories were collapsed, the overall accuracy improved to 94%. Personalized models demonstrated higher accuracy than generalized models. Conclusions: KNOWME Networks can accurately detect a range of activities. KNOWME has the ability to collect and process data in real-time, building the foundation for tailored, real-time interventions to increase PA or decrease sedentary time. © 2012 Human Kinetics, Inc.",pmid,21934162,Scopus,Journal of Physical Activity and Health,"Emken B.A., Li M., Thatte G., Lee S., Annavaram M., Mitra U., Narayanan S., Spruijt-Metz D.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,"The Effects Of Fifa 2015 Computer Games On Changes In Cognitive, Hormonal And Brain Waves Functions Of Young Men Volunteers.","Computer games have attracted remarkable attentions in general publics with different cultures and their effects are subject of research by cognitive neuroscientists. In the present study, possible effects of the game Fifa 2015 on cognitive performance, hormonal levels, and electroencephalographic (EEG) signals were evaluated in young male volunteers. Thirty two subjects aged 20 years on average participated mutually in playing computer game Fifa 2015. Identification information and general knowledge about the game were collected. Saliva samples from the contestants were obtained before and after the competition. Perceptive and cognitive performance including the general cognitive health, response delay, attention maintenance, and mental fatigue were measured using PASAT test. EEG were recorded during the play using EEG device and analyzed later using QEEG. Simultaneously, the players' behavior were recorded using a video camera. Saliva cortisol levels were assessed by ELISA kit. Data were analyzed by SPSS program. The impact of playing computer games on cortisol concentration of saliva before and after the game showed that the amount of saliva plasma after playing the game has dropped significantly. Also the impact of playing computer games on mental health, before and after the game indicated that the number of correct answers has not changed significantly. This indicates that sustained attention has increased in participants after the game in comparison with before that. Also it is shown that mental fatigue measured by PASAT test, did not changed significantly after the game in comparison to before that. The impact of game on changes in brain waves showed that the subjects in high activity state during playing the game had higher power of the EEG signals in most of the channels in lower frequency bands in compared to normal state. The present study showed that computer games can positively affect the stress system and the perceptual-cognitive system. Even though this impact was not significant in most cases, the changes in cognitive and hormonal test and also in brain waves were visible. Hence, due to the importance of this matter, it is necessary to create control systems in selecting the types of games for playing.",pmid,26904177,pubmed,Basic and clinical neuroscience,"Aliyari, Hamed; Kazemi, Masoomeh; Tekieh, Elaheh; Salehi, Maryam; Sahraei, Hedayat; Daliri, Mohammad Reza; Agaei, Hassan; Minaei-Bidgoli, Behrouz; Lashgari, Reza; Srahian, Nahid; Hadipour, Mohammad Mehdi; Salehi, Mostafa; Ranjbar Aghdam, Asghar",2016,NA,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Violent Video Game Effects On Children And Adolescents. A Review Of The Literature.,"Studies of violent video games on children and adolescents were reviewed to: 1) determine the multiple effects; 2) to offer critical observations about common strengths and weaknesses in the literature; 3) to provide a broader perspective to understand the research on the effects of video games. The review includes general theoretical and methodological considerations of media violence, and description of the general aggression model (GAM). The literature was evaluated in relation to the GAM. Published literature, including meta-analyses, are reviewed, as well as relevant unpublished material, such as conference papers and dissertations. Overall, the evidence supports hypotheses that violent video game play is related to aggressive affect, physiological arousal, aggressive cognitions, and aggressive behaviours. The effects of video game play on school performance are also evaluated, and the review concludes with a dimensional approach to video game effects. The dimensional approach evaluates video game effects in terms of amount, content, form, and mechanics, and appears to have many advantages for understanding and predicting the multiple types of effects demonstrated in the literature.",pmid,16402007,pubmed,Minerva pediatrica,"Gentile, D A; Stone, W",2007,NA,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Xinyinqin: A Computer-Based Heart Sound Simulator.,"""Xinyinqin"" is the Chinese phoneticized name of the Heart Sound Simulator (HSS). The ""qin"" in ""Xinyinqin"" is the Chinese name of a category of musical instruments, which means that the operation of HSS is very convenient--like playing an electric piano with the keys. HSS is connected to the GAME I/O of an Apple microcomputer. The generation of sound is controlled by a program. Xinyinqin is used as a teaching aid of Diagnostics. It has been applied in teaching for three years. In this demonstration we will introduce the following functions of HSS: 1) The main program has two modules. The first one is the heart auscultation training module. HSS can output a heart sound selected by the student. Another program module is used to test the student's learning condition. The computer can randomly simulate a certain heart sound and ask the student to name it. The computer gives the student's answer an assessment: ""correct"" or ""incorrect."" When the answer is incorrect, the computer will output that heart sound again for the student to listen to; this process is repeated until she correctly identifies it. 2) The program is convenient to use and easy to control. By pressing the S key, it is able to output a slow heart rate until the student can clearly identify the rhythm. The heart rate, like the actual rate of a patient, can then be restored by hitting any key. By pressing the SPACE BAR, the heart sound output can be stopped to allow the teacher to explain something to the student. The teacher can resume playing the heart sound again by hitting any key; she can also change the content of the training by hitting RETURN key. In the future, we plan to simulate more heart sounds and incorporate relevant graphs.",pmid,8591549,Scopus,Medinfo. MEDINFO,"Zhan X.X., Pei J.H., Xiao Y.H.",1995,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,A Game Strategy For Power Flow Control Of Distributed Generators In Smart Grids,"We consider the distributed power control problem of distributed generators(DGs) in smart grid. In order to ensure the aggregated power output level to be desirable, a group of DGs with local and directed communications are expected to operate at the specified same ratio of their maximal available power output. To that end, the non-cooperative game is introduced and the DGs are modeled as self-interested game players. A new game model, termed state based weakly acyclic game, is developed to specify decision making architecture for each DGs, and at the point of the equilibrium of the game, the global objective of the power control problem can be achieved through autonomous DGs that are capable of making rational decisions to optimize their own payoff functions based on the local and directed information from other DGs. The validness of the proposed methodology is verified in simulation. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.",eid,2-s2.0-84908508640,Scopus,Communications in Computer and Information Science,"Zhang J., Qi D., Zhang G., Zhao G.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Adaptive Strategies: A Novel Game-Theoretic Analysis For Autonomous Distributed Systems In Dynamic Environments,"We propose a new concept of an adaptive strategy, and we consider its robustness against other strategies. On average, the adaptive strategy achieves a higher payoff than other strategies. The strength of a strategy is defined as an adaptive measure calculated on the basis of a payoff obtained through interactions among agents. An agent interacts with other agents by selecting various strategies in computer networks. For the adaptive strategy, we give a formal definition of the adaptive measure of how well it behaves against other strategies. In order to demonstrate a performance of the adaptive strategy, we present a calculation example of the adaptive measure for the iterated prisoner's dilemma with three simple strategies. In the examplee, Trigger strategy is found to be the best strategy when we evaluate it by the adaptive measure, even if All-D (always defect) strategy achieves the highest expected payoff. Furthermore, we investigate the adaptive strategies for a self-repairing network consisting of agents with spatial strategies. According to simulations, under some conditions, the strategies obtaining the highest adaptive measures do not correspond to those with the highest averaged resources. The significance of the adaptive strategies is considered with a statistical analysis. The adaptive measure enables us to evaluate the behaviors of the adaptive strategies against those of other strategies. In addition, we discuss some open problems for polishing a notion of the adaptive strategies. © 2014.",eid,2-s2.0-84898626702,Scopus,"International Journal of Innovative Computing, Information and Control","Tokümitsu M., Ishida A.Y.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,An Analysis Of The Insertion Of Virtual Players In Gmabs Methodology Using The Vip-Jogoman Prototype,"The GMABS (Games and Multi-Agent-Based Simulation) methodology was created from the integration of RPG and MABS techniques. This methodology links the dynamic capacity of MABS (Multi-Agent-Based Simulation) and the discussion and learning capacity of RPG (Role-Playing Games). Using GMABS, we have developed two prototypes in the natural resources management domain. The first prototype, called JogoMan (Adamatti et. al, 2005), is a paper-based game: all players need to be physically present in the same place and time, and there is a minimum needed number of participants to play the game. In order to avoid this constraint, we have built a second prototype, called ViP-JogoMan (Adamatti et. al, 2007), which is an extension of the first one. This second game enables the insertion of virtual players that can substitute some real players in the game. These virtual players can partially mime real behaviors and capture autonomy, social abilities, reaction and adaptation of the real players. We have chosen the BDI architecture to model these virtual players, since its paradigm is based on folk psychology; hence, its core concepts easily map the language that people use to describe their reasoning and actions in everyday life. ViP-JogoMan is a computer-based game, in which people play via Web, players can be in different places and it does not have a hard constraint regarding the minimum number of real players. Our aim in this paper is to present some test results obtained with both prototypes, as well as to present a preliminary discussion on how the insertion of virtual players has affected the game results. © JASSS.",eid,2-s2.0-68349104328,Scopus,JASSS,"Adamatti D.F., Sichman J.S., Coelho H.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Authenticity In The Age Of Digital Companions,"The first generation of children to grow up with electronic toys and games saw computers as their ""nearest neighbors."" They spoke of computers as rational machines and of people as emotional machines, a fragile formulation destined to be challenged. By the mid- 1990s, computational creatures, including robots, were presenting themselves as ""relational artifacts,"" beings with feelings and needs. One consequence of this development is a crisis in authenticity in many quarters. In an increasing number of situations, people behave as though they no longer privilege authentic emotion. This paper examines watershed moments in the history of human-machine interaction, focusing on the implications of relational artifacts for our collective perception of aliveness and for human-to-human relationships. For now, the exploration of human-robot encounters leads us to questions about the human purposes of believable digital companions that are evocative but not authentic. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.",eid,2-s2.0-39049140285,Scopus,Interaction Studies,Turkle S.,2007,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali

,Designing Affective Video Games To Support The Social-Emotional Development Of Teenagers With Autism Spectrum Disorders,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of developmental neuropsychiatric disorders, comprised of three diagnostic entities - autistic disorder (AD), Asperger's disorder (AS), and Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (including atypical autism) (PDD-NOS). A number of intervention techniques are currently used to reduce some of the associated challenges, with techniques ranging from behavioral therapy to dietary interventions and traditional counseling. This positional paper proposes the use of video games which leverage affective computing technologies as intervention in autism spectrum disorders in the context of the use of traditional play therapy with adolescents, who may feel uncomfortable engaging in traditional play with toys they may be too old for. It aims to explore the potential for greater 'social physics' made possible by affective computing technologies. This involves computationally 'recognizing' emotions in a user, often through the use of multimodal affective sensors, including facial expressions, postural shifts, and physiological signals such as heart rate, skin conductivity, and EEG signals. However, it is suggested that this should be augmented by researching the effect of social game design mechanisms on social-emotional development, particularly for those who experience difficulty with social interaction.",eid,2-s2.0-77952991543,Scopus,Annual Review of CyberTherapy and Telemedicine,Khandaker M.,2009,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Digital Gaming And Language Learning: Autonomy And Community,"The relationship between digital game play and second language (L2) learning is a particularly tricky issue in East Asia. Though there is an emerging presence of Chinese online games, many more young people are playing the English- or Japanese-language versions of the most popular commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) video games. In other words, most Chinese gamers are playing L2 digital games in their leisure time. Informed by research on out-of-class L2 learning, this paper discusses findings from an exploratory study investigating L2 gaming and learning practices in young people's everyday lives. Drawing on rich data from gaming sessions, stimulated recall, focus group discussion, individual interviews and online discussion forums, this paper argues that gamers exercise autonomy by managing their gameplay both as leisure and learning practices in different dimensions (location, formality, locus of control, pedagogy and trajectory). At the same time, gameplay-as-learning practices are supported by wider communities of digital gamers who take on roles as language teachers and advisers. The paper suggests that activities in these dimensions mediated learning autonomously and from community, and discusses the research and pedagogical implications for L2 gaming and learning. © Alice Chik.",eid,2-s2.0-84901217961,Scopus,Language Learning and Technology,Chik A.,2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Educational Computer Games And Their Application To Developmental Disabilities,"Most children enjoy playing computer games. This makes computer technology ideal for educational applications, as intrinsic motivation for learning is built into the game. Considering that nowadays most children spend quite a bit of their waking hours in front of a computer, it is clearly desirable to make computer games as educational as possible. These considerations hold generally true for children with typical development as well as for children with developmental disabilities or with mental impairments. There is quite a long history of the use of computers in educational settings, including special education, but the explosive growth of rapidly evolving computer technology plus recent findings from research in education and in developmental disabilities make computers an ever more promising, appropriate, and powerful tool in any learning environment today. Modern educational computer games have several immense advantages: Considering that most families have access to a computer, these games are inexpensive, widely distributable, and easily accessible for most families, largely independent of economic status (i.e., ""democratization of learning opportunities""). They may reduce the need for costly one-on-one professional tutoring. These games can be designed to be fun and dynamic. Perhaps most importantly, computer games can be custom-designed to adjust in ""real time"" and ""on-line"" to the player's individual characteristics, whether those are strengths or weaknesses. Most recently, we designed a simple computer game that can be enjoyed and played successfully by low-functioning children with autism and has been shown to be useful in assessing the child's individual attention patterns in language perception. The game is also designed such that in the future attention to general visual and auditory information can be assessed. With this approach, for example, synchronicity of facial expression and emotional tone in language can be assessed. Perception of both language and emotions are known to be problematic for many children with autism. Future development aims at building in features that allow the computer to monitor the child's individual attention patterns, adjust to them, and then implement attentionshaping methods to remediate any deficits. A general application will be to help focus and expand the attention span of children with autism and with attention deficit disorder. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

,Educational Technology In Flipped Course Design,"The use of technology to engage students and to provide them with tools to study autonomously is increasingly frequent in higher education. This paper outlines an experimental study that analyzes the effectiveness of flipped classroom design, and argues how the use of technological, educational resources such as videos of educators teaching, interactive materials, simulators, virtual labs and game-based learning have facilitated the use of class time for active learning and discussion. The study was conducted in several academic years with groups studying Fundamentals of Computer Technology, a core subject in the first year of the Computer Engineering and Information Systems degree courses. We analyzed data collected from online activities on a learning platform created from scratch, from classroom activities and from attitudinal and satisfaction surveys. We compared the evolution of outcomes between the 2009-2010 and 2015-2016 academic years. The methodology followed a quantitative design with control and experimental groups, and descriptive statistical techniques were used. The results obtained show that learning achievement and performance in terms of qualifications were higher in the experimental groups, where the flipped classroom approach using technological resources was adopted, than in the control groups, where the traditional lecture approach was used. A significant positive effect on participation, engagement and student satisfaction was also identified. © 2017 TEMPUS Publications.",eid,2-s2.0-85022075531,Scopus,International Journal of Engineering Education,"Estriégana-Valdehita R., Plata R.B., Medina-Merodio J.-A.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Effect Of Court Dimensions On Players' External And Internal Load During Small-Sided Handball Games,"The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of three different court dimensions on the internal and external load during small-sided handball games. Six male amateur handball players took part in this study and participated in three different 8-min 3vs3 (plus goalkeepers) small-sided handball games (each repeated twice). The three court dimensions were 12×24m, 30×15m and 32×16m. Through Global Positioning System devices (SPI pro elite 15Hz, GPSports) and video analysis, the following parameters were recorded: cyclic and acyclic movements (distance covered and number of technical actions executed), heart rate, and rating of perceived exertion (RPE). Total distance travelled increased with court dimensions (885.2m ± 66.6m in 24×12m; 980.0m ± 73.4m in 30×15m; 1095.0m ± 112.9m in 32×16m, p &lt; 0.05). The analysis of distance covered in the four speed zones (0-1.4 m·s-1; 1.4-3.4 m·s-1; 3.4-5.2 m·s-1; &gt;5.2 m·s-1) highlighted substantial differences: playing with the 30×15m court in comparison to the 24×12m, the players covered less distance in the first speed zone (p = 0.012; ES = 0.70) and more distance in the second (p = 0.049; ES = 0.73) and third (p = 0.012; ES = 0.51) speed zones. Statistical differences were also found between the 24×12m and 32×16m courts: the players covered more distance in the second and third speed zones (p = 0.013, ES = 0.76; p = 0.023 ES = 0.69) with the 32×16m court in comparison to the 24×12m. There was no significant effect of court dimensions on the technical parameters (number of team actions, passes, piston movements toward goal and defensive activities), the number of specific handball jumps and changes of direction, and the time spent in the different heart rate zones. Considering the average data of all the experimental conditions together (24×12m, 30×15m, 32×16m), a pronounced statistical difference was highlighted between the values in first two HR zones and the last two (p &lt; 0.05; large ES). The rating of perceived exertion was significantly higher during the drill with the 32×16m court compared with the 24×12m one (p &lt; 0.05; ES = 2.34). Our findings indicate that changing court dimensions during small-sided handball games can be used to manipulate both external and internal loads on the players. © Journal of Sports Science and Medicine.",eid,2-s2.0-84901693326,Scopus,Journal of Sports Science and Medicine,"Corvino M., Tessitore A., Minganti C., Sibila M.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Entertainment Feature Of A Computer Game Using A Biological Signal To Realize A Battle With Oneself,"A novel computer game was developed in which a player challenges him- or herself using the skin conductance response to make the player aware of his or her own agitation. This game was developed as a paradoxical system in which their desire to win makes it more difficult to win. This type of game was found to have the following characteristics. First, players find uncontrollable themselves due to viewing their biological signals. In this situation, a kind of self-reference system is constructed. Second, the environments changed how the game was enjoyed. Third, the game system reveals differences of context between player and observer. From these characteristics, it is thought that the use of biological signals is attractive for entertainment computing. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2004.",eid,2-s2.0-33646191844,Scopus,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),"Sakurazawa S., Munekata N., Yoshida N., Tsukahara Y., Matsubara H.",2004,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali

,Framework Of Controlling 3D Virtual Human Emotional Walking Using Bci,"A Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is the device that can read and acquire the brain activities. A human body is controlled by Brain-Signals, which considered as a main controller. Furthermore, the human emotions and thoughts will be translated by brain through brain signals and expressed as human mood. This controlling process mainly performed through brain signals, the brain signals is a key component in electroencephalogram (EEG). Based on signal processing the features representing human mood (behavior) could be extracted with emotion as a major feature. This paper proposes a new framework in order to recognize the human inner emotions that have been conducted on the basis of EEG signals using a BCI device controller. This framework go through five steps starting by classifying the brain signal after reading it in order to obtain the emotion, then map the emotion, synchronize the animation of the 3D virtual human, test and evaluate the work. Based on our best knowledge there is no framework for controlling the 3D virtual human. As a result for implementing our framework will enhance the game field of enhancing and controlling the 3D virtual humans’ emotion walking in order to enhance and bring more realistic as well. Commercial games and Augmented Reality systems are possible beneficiaries of this technique. © 2015 Penerbit UTM Press.

,Games Of Drones: The Uneasy Future Of The Soldier-Hero In Call Of Duty: Black Ops Ii,"In this article, I argue that the first-person shooter video game, Call of Duty: Black Ops II, reflects the U.S. military's transition as it reimagines the soldier's role in war. In the age of drone technology, this role shifts from a position of strength to one of relative weakness. Although video games that feature future combat often ""function as virtual enactments and endorsements for developing military technologies,"" Black Ops II offers a surprisingly complex vision of the future of drones and U.S. soldiers (Smicker 2009: 107). To explore how the game reflects a contemporary vision of the U.S. military, I weave together a close textual reading of two levels in Black Ops II with actual accounts from drone pilots and politicians that illuminate the nature of drone combat. Although there are moments in Black Ops II in which avatars combat enemies with first-hand firepower, the experience of heroic diegetic violence is superseded by a combat experience defined by powerlessness, boredom, and ambiguous pleasure. The shift of the soldier from imposing hero to a banal figure experiences its logical conclusion in Unmanned, an independent video game that foregrounds the mundane, nonviolent nature of drone piloting. Instead of training soldiers to withstand emotionally devastating experiences of death and violence first-hand (or to physically enact such violence), games like Black Ops II and Unmanned train actual and potential soldiers to tolerate monotony and disempowerment. © The author(s), 2014.",eid,2-s2.0-84904970496,Scopus,Surveillance and Society,Andersen C.,2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali

,"High Versus Low Aggressive Priming During Video-Game Training: Effects On Violent Action During Game Play, Hostility, Heart Rate, And Blood Pressure","Playing violent video games is related to increased negative affect and cardiovascular reactivity. We examined the influence of high and low aggressive priming during video-game training on violence during game play (e.g., shooting, choking), hostility, frustration with game play, blood pressure, and heart rate. Male undergraduates (N= 36) were assigned to a high aggressive or low aggressive video-game priming condition. After training, they played Metal Gear Solid™, which allows players to advance by using stealth, violence, or both. Participants in the high aggressive priming condition used significantly more violent action during game play and reported more hostility than those in the low aggressive priming condition. Heart rate was correlated with feelings of hostility. These findings indicate that both aggressive priming and use of game violence influence arousal and negative affect and might increase behavioral aggression.",eid,2-s2.0-0036914485,Scopus,Journal of Applied Social Psychology,"Panee C.D., Ballard M.E.",2002,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,How Can An Agent Learn To Negotiate?,"Negotiation has been extensively discussed in game-theoretic, economic, and management science literatures for decades. Recent growing interest in autonomous interacting software agents and their potential application in areas such as electronic commerce has given increased importance to automated negotiation. Evidence both from theoretical analysis and from observations of human interactions suggests that if decision makers can somehow take into consideration what other agents are thinking and furthermore learn during their interactions how other agents behave, their payoff might increase. In this paper, we propose a sequential decision making model of negotiation, called Bazaar. It provides an adaptive, multi-issue negotiation model capable of exhibiting a rich set of negotiation behaviors. Within the proposed negotiation framework, we model learning as a Bayesian belief update process. We prove that under certain conditions learning is indeed beneficial. © 2015, Lecture Notes in Computer Science.

,Humans Deceived By Predatory Stealth Strategy Camouflaging Motion,"Motion camouflage is a stealth strategy that allows a predator to conceal its apparent motion as it approaches a moving prey. Although male hoverflies have been observed to move in a manner consistent with motion camouflage to track females, the successful application of the technique has not previously been demonstrated. This article describes the implementation and results of a psychophysical experiment suggesting that humans are susceptible to motion camouflage. The experiment masqueraded as a computer-game competition. The basis of the competition was a game designed to test the comparative success of different predatory-approach strategies. The experiment showed that predators were able to approach closer to their prey (the player of the game) before being detected when using motion camouflage than when using other approach strategies tested. For an autonomous predator, the calculation of a motion-camouflage approach is a non-trivial problem. It was, therefore, of particular interest that in the game the players were deceived by motion-camouflage predators controlled by artificial neural systems operating using realistic levels of input information. It is suggested that these results are especially of interest to biologists, visual psychophysicists, military engineers and computer-games designers.",eid,2-s2.0-0041529639,Scopus,Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences,"Anderson A.J., McOwan P.W.",2003,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali

,Reconciling White-Box And Black-Box Perspectives On Behavioral Self-Adaptation,"This paper proposes to reconcile two perspectives on behavioral adaptation commonly taken at different stages of the engineering of autonomic computing systems. Requirements engineering activities often take a black-box perspective: A system is considered to be adaptive with respect to an environment whenever the system is able to satisfy its goals irrespectively of the environment perturbations. Modeling and programming engineering activities often take a white-box perspective: A system is equipped with suitable adaptation mechanisms and its behavior is classified as adaptive depending on whether the adaptation mechanisms are enacted or not. The proposed approach reconciles black- and whitebox perspectives by proposing several notions of coherence between the adaptivity as observed by the two perspectives: These notions provide useful criteria for the system developer to assess and possibly modify the adaptation requirements, models and programs of an autonomic system. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",eid,2-s2.0-84924347976,Scopus,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),"Bruni R., Corradini A., Gadducci F., HÖLzl M., Lafuente A.L., Vandin A., Wirsing M.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali

,"The Effects Of Fifa 2015 Computer Games On Changes In Cognitive, Hormonal And Brain Waves Functions Of Young Men Volunteers","Introduction: Computer games have attracted remarkable attentions in general publics with different cultures and their effects are subject of research by cognitive neuroscientists. In the present study, possible effects of the game Fifa 2015 on cognitive performance, hormonal levels, and electroencephalographic (EEG) signals were evaluated in young male volunteers. Methods: Thirty two subjects aged 20 years on average participated mutually in playing computer game Fifa 2015. Identification information and general knowledge about the game were collected. Saliva samples from the contestants were obtained before and after the competition. Perceptive and cognitive performance including the general cognitive health, response delay, attention maintenance, and mental fatigue were measured using PASAT test. EEG were recorded during the play using EEG device and analyzed later using QEEG. Simultaneously, the players' behavior were recorded using a video camera. Saliva cortisol levels were assessed by ELISA kit. Data were analyzed by SPSS program. Results: The impact of playing computer games on cortisol concentration of saliva before and after the game showed that the amount of saliva plasma after playing the game has dropped significantly. Also the impact of playing computer games on mental health, before and after the game indicated that the number of correct answers has not changed significantly. This indicates that sustained attention has increased in participants after the game in comparison with before that. Also it is shown that mental fatigue measured by PASAT test, did not changed significantly after the game in comparison to before that. The impact of game on changes in brain waves showed that the subjects in high activity state during playing the game had higher power of the EEG signals in most of the channels in lower frequency bands in compared to normal state. Discussion: The present study showed that computer games can positively affect the stress system and the perceptual-cognitive system. Even though this impact was not significant in most cases, the changes in cognitive and hormonal test and also in brain waves were visible. Hence, due to the importance of this matter, it is necessary to create control systems in selecting the types of games for playing.",eid,2-s2.0-84937216083,Scopus,Basic and Clinical Neuroscience,"Aliyari H., Kazemi M., Tekieh E., Salehi M., Sahraei H., Daliri M.R., Agaei H., Minaei-Bidgoli B., Lashgari R., Srahian N., Hadipour M.M., Salehi M., Aghdam A.R.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,The Influence Of Media Violence On Youth,"Research on violent television and films, video games, and music reveals unequivocal evidence that media violence increases the likelihood of aggressive and violent behavior in both immediate and long-term contexts. The effects appear larger for milder than for more severe forms of aggression, but the effects on severe forms of violence are also substantial (r = .13 to .32) when compared with effects of other violence risk factors or medical effects deemed important by the medical community (e.g., effect of aspirin on heart attacks). The research base is large; diverse in methods, samples, and media genres; and consistent in overall findings. The evidence is clearest within the most extensively researched domain, television and film violence. The growing body of video-game research yields essentially the same conclusions. Short-term exposure increases the likelihood of physically and verbally aggressive behavior, aggressive thoughts, and aggressive emotions. Recent large-scale longitudinal studies provide converging evidence linking frequent exposure to violent media in childhood with aggression later in life, including physical assaults and spouse abuse. Because extremely violent criminal behaviors (e.g., forcible rape, aggravated assault, homicide) are rare, new longitudinal studies with larger samples are needed to estimate accurately how much habitual childhood exposure to media violence increases the risk for extreme violence. Well-supported theory delineates why and when exposure to media violence increases aggression and violence. Media violence produces short-term increases by priming existing aggressive scripts and cognitions, increasing physiological arousal, and triggering an automatic tendency to imitate observed behaviors. Media violence produces long-term effects via several types of learning processes leading to the acquisition of lasting (and automatically accessible) aggressive scripts, interpretational schemas, and aggression-supporting beliefs about social behavior, and by reducing individuals' normal negative emotional responses to violence (i.e., desensitization). Certain characteristics of viewers (e.g., identification with aggressive characters), social environments (e.g., parental influences), and media content (e.g., attractiveness of the perpetrator) can influence the degree to which media violence affects aggression, but there are some inconsistencies in research results. This research also suggests some avenues for preventive intervention (e.g., parental supervision, interpretation, and control of children's media use). However, extant research on moderators suggests that no one is wholly immune to the effects of media violence. Recent surveys reveal an extensive presence of violence in modern media. Furthermore, many children and youth spend an inordinate amount of time consuming violent media. Although it is clear that reducing exposure to media violence will reduce aggression and violence, it is less clear what sorts of interventions will produce a reduction in exposure. The sparse research literature suggests that counterattitudinal and parental-mediation interventions are likely to yield beneficial effects, but that media literacy interventions by themselves are unsuccessful. Though the scientific debate over whether media violence increases aggression and violence is essentially over, several critical tasks remain. Additional laboratory and field studies are needed for a better understanding of underlying psychological processes, which eventually should lead to more effective interventions. Large-scale longitudinal studies would help specify the magnitude of media-violence effects on the most severe types of violence. Meeting the larger societal challenge of providing children and youth with a much healthier media diet may prove to be more difficult and costly, especially if the scientific, news, public policy, and entertainment communities fail to educate the general public about the real risks of media-violence exposure to children and youth.",eid,2-s2.0-1842606455,Scopus,"Psychological Science in the Public Interest, Supplement","Anderson C.A., Berkowitz L., Donnerstein E., Huesmann L.R., Johnson J.D., Linz D., Malamuth N.M., Wartella E.",2003,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali

Various sensors placed around the racing cars constantly send information back to the ECU and the data is received by the engineers when the car returns to the garage.

The additional sensors allow accurate data to give direct comparisons between new and existing components fitted into the car. The gearbox oil temperatures that do not change very quickly is samples every second while the processor bandwidth is selected depending on the status of the car.

,The Routinization Of Creativity: Lessons From The Case Of A Video-Game Creative Powerhouse,"The aim of this contribution is to proceed to an in-depth exploration of the micro-context of the origin of routines and of their intimate link with organizational creativity. Our view is that organizational creativity orchestrates continuous interactions between different types of routines, operating at different levels of the organization. More precisely we propose distinguishing three types of routines: - First, the routines issued from formal structures or hierarchical working groups in the firm (functional groups, project teams, task force, etc.), for which the context of work and coordination of specialized tasks is defined ex ante by the hierarchy of the firm; - Second, the routines emerging from informal structures, the ""knowing communities"" which is a ""generic term that defines different types of autonomous learning groups of individuals (communities of practice, epistemic communities, and other more or less informal learning groups) united by common beliefs and interests who voluntarily share their resources on a long term basis in order to create and diffuse knowledge""; - Third, the routines that are inherently related to the organizational creativity of the firm, which are essentially corporate routines as expression of patterns of thinking, feeling and acting in the corporate culture. In essence they are the genes of collective identity, and take the shape of project management staging and gating principles and practices, framing collective divergent exploration and convergent production toward a creative goal. The contribution is based on an in-depth analysis of the organizational creativity in the world-leading videogame company, Ubisoft, with a special focus on the studio located in Montréal. To some extent, Ubisoft is one of the flagships of the ""creative industries"", in which the clear imperative is to sustain creativity on a permanent basis. These reasons explain the choice we made to test our approach of organizational creativity and routines in this firm. © 2014, Walter de Gruyter GmbH.

,Traumatic Fracture Of The Cricoid Cartilage: Description Of A Case And Review Of The Literature,"Laryngeal traumas may be very serious. If they are not recognised and promptly treated, in fact, even fatal complications may arise. This paper reviews the relevant literature and describes a case of cricoid cartilage fracture that occurred during a basketball game when a player was stuck on the larynx by a team-mate's elbow. Examination of the larynx with a fibroscope by the club's doctor did not disclose any glottal injuries, nor loss of motility. Computerized tomography (CT), however, revealed a cricoid fracture. This was repaired surgically three days after the trauma. No general or local complications ensued. After one month, the player resumed match training under medical supervision with no respiratory problems and took part in his first game after 45 days. ©2001, Editrice Kurtis.",eid,2-s2.0-0035790374,Scopus,European Journal of Sports Traumatology and Related Research,"Carletti M., Martegani S., Masola M., Luoni S., Mazzoni S., Spriano G., Macchi A., Maffioli M.",2001,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali

,Vigorous Energy Expenditure With A Dance Exer-Game,"Physical inactivity is a risk factor for heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. Efforts to increase physical activity can include active video games. While many active video games demonstrate exertion levels commensurate with light to moderate exercise, it is unclear whether these games can meet requirements for vigorous activity. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the active video game, Dance Dance Revolution (DDR), can provide vigorous exercise in a wide range of adults. Twelve adults (18 to 53 yrs, BMI 18 to 37) were studied while playing DDR at an advanced level. Metabolic measures were collected during a 30 min game-play protocol at the advanced ""Heavy"" level of difficulty. Mean values achieved were the following: 8 METs, heart rate 157 beats·min-1, and energy expenditure 9 kcal·min-1. DDR is played similarly to that of interval type exercise where each game-song is followed by a brief rest period. Subjects reported that DDR is fun, and that the competitive nature of playing with others is enjoyable. This study found that DDR is effective in meeting vigorous physical activity requirements for improving or maintaining physical fitness.",eid,2-s2.0-80051821582,Scopus,Journal of Exercise Physiology Online,"Adam Noah J., Spierer D.K., Tachibana A., Bronner S.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,A Bayesian Approach To Multiagent Reinforcement Learning And Coalition Formation Under Uncertainty,"Sequential decision making under uncertainty is always a challenge for autonomous agents populating a multiagent environment, since their behaviour is inevitably influenced by the behaviour of others. Further, agents have to constantly struggle to find the right balance between exploiting  current information regarding the environment and the rest of its inhabitants, and exploring so that they acquire additional information. Moreover, they need to profitably trade off short-term rewards with anticipated long-term ones, while learning through interaction about the environment and others—employing techniques from reinforcement learning (RL), a fundamental area of study within artificial intelligence (AI).  Coalition formation is a problem of great interest within game theory and AI, allowing autonomous individually rational agents to form stable or transient teams (or coalitions) to tackle an underlying task. Agents participating in realistic scenarios of repeated  coalition formation under uncertainty face the issues identified above, and need to bargain to succesfully negotiate the terms of their participation in coalitions—often having to compromise individual with team welfare effectively.    In this thesis, we provide theoretical and algorithmic tools to accommodate  sequential decision making under uncertainty in multiagent settings, dealing with the issues above. Specifically, we combine multiagent Bayesian RL with game theoretic ideas to facilitate the agents' sequential decision making. We deal with popular multiagent problems which were to date not tackled under uncertainty, or more specifically under type uncertainty.  In our work, we assume that the environment dynamics or the types (capabilities) of other agents are not known, and thus the agents have to account for this uncertainty, in a Bayesian way, when making decisions. Handling type uncertainty allows information about others acquired within one setting to be exploited in possibly different settings in the future.    The core of our contributions lies in the area of coalition formation under uncertainty. We studied several aspects of both the cooperative and non-cooperative facets of this problem, coining new theoretical concepts, proving theoretical results, presenting and evaluating algorithms for use in this context, and proposing a Bayesian RL framework for optimal repeated coalition formation under uncertainty.",pq_id,304762020,proquest_dt,NA,"Chalkiadakis, Georgios",2007,THES,Ph.D.,reviewer2,Ali
,A Framework For Element-Based Computer Graphics.,"There is an imbalance between personal and algorithmic control in existing techniques for element-based computer graphics. A refraining of the traditional graphics pipeline is used to address this. By turning modelling and rendering into an interactive process, and introducing semi-autonomous agents to manage elements, we develop a framework through which it is possible to build applications with a given control balance. Agents negotiate control of their representations on a canvas via interactions in agent space. Interaction with the rendered image on canvas is conveyed to agents responsible for that image, which interpret the interaction and adjust the underlying model appropriately. In addition, the concept of a coalition, as in game theory, provides a means for groups of agents to organise or be organised. This framework is realised as a prototype engine along with a series of examples that illustrate a broad range of variations in control balance that are possible within this framework.",pq_id,33201757,proquest_dt,NA,"Mason, Katherine Merle",2006,THES,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,Active Target Localization And Tracking With Application To Robotic Environmental Monitoring,"Thanks to advances in miniaturization, computing power, reliable sensors, and battery life, mobile robots are increasingly being used for a wide variety of environmental monitoring tasks. No longer confined to factory floors or controlled environments, robots for remote sensing in dangerous or hard-to-reach  environments could provide the same scalability, precision, and reliability to environmental monitoring as they did to industrial applications.  To enable this kind of long-term, reliable, autonomous mobile sensor deployment, algorithms which can ensure that the robots achieve their sensing tasks are required.    In the first part of the thesis, we study the problem of using one or more mobile robots equipped with bearing sensors to locate a stationary target in minimum time. The problem requires optimizing the measurement locations of the robots  to gather the required information about the target's location.  In addition, when multiple  robots collaborate, we include communication constraints in the path planning objective. Two formulations for this problem are studied. First, we study the offline problem of finding measurement trajectories when the true target location is known. Second, we study the online version and show how to adapt the offline solution to the situation when the target location is not known, while preserving the quality guarantees of the offline solution.    In the second part of the thesis,  we study the problem of locating multiple stationary targets using a single mobile robot. We formulate a novel coverage problem and provide two main results. We first study the problem of initializing consistent estimate  of the targets' locations.  These initial estimates are used to seed an active localization algorithm which is shown to localize the targets quickly.  In a second formulation, we assume that the targets are within a set of polygonal regions, but have no further information about the distribution or number of targets in the environment.  An algorithm is provided which can choose measurement locations to localize all the targets to within desired precision in near optimal time.    In the third part of the thesis, we study the problem of using bearing information to track and capture a moving target. We present two formulations based on  pursuit-evasion games. In the open plane, the objective is for a mobile robot to minimize the distance to a maneuvering target when only uncertain bearing information is available to the robot. Then, we study the problem of capturing the maneuvering target in a closed environment by moving close to it. We show that the size of the environment relative to the sensing noise determines if this is possible.    In addition to theoretical results, we present field studies of using one or  more mobile robots to detect radio transmitters using these results. We show that the algorithms presented are suitable for use in monitoring invasive fish.",pq_id,1733949402,proquest_dt,NA,"Vander Hook, Joshua David",2015,THES,Ph.D.,reviewer2,Ali
,Autonomic Trust Management In Dynamic Systems,"Research in pervasive computing is aimed at creating environments where users can seamlessly benefit from ubiquitous computing resources despite the complexity of the environment. Providing security in such systems is a difficult task since traditional security mechanisms often require significant user attention and do not scale well to large, mobile, and open environments. To combat this problem, distributed trust has been proposed to provide security in pervasive systems. While much research has been performed in the area, many vulnerabilities and insufficiencies still exist, especially in mobile ad-hoc systems that cannot support distributed trust mechanisms requiring pre-existing infrastructure and cooperation. Dynamic pervasive systems operate in highly dynamic environments that introduce additional challenges such as intermittent connectivity and lack of infrastructure.   This dissertation addresses several problems pertinent to the design and deployment of distributed trust mechanisms in dynamic pervasive systems. In particular, this dissertation presents the design and evaluation of the following framework and mechanisms to enhance security in dynamic systems. The Distributed Trust Toolkit (DTT) is a modular framework for the design and deployment of distributed trust mechanisms over a wide variety of systems, networks, and devices. Adaptive Resource Exploration (AREX) and Reliable Service Composition (ReSCo) are built for two specific classes of applications that occur frequently in dynamic systems. AREX uses a game theoretic approach to motivate strategic, malicious entities to attack less often. ReSCo is designed for dynamic service composition systems and works by adapting to make selections of compositions paths and nodes. Social Trust (SoTru) is a system for augmenting trust mechanisms such as AREX and ReSCo with information from users' social networks to reduce risk and enhance their performance. A unique feature of the above contributions is that each can be used independently or in combination to address challenges in secure dynamic systems. DTT facilitates the integration of AREX, ReSCo and SoTru into existing dynamic systems. AREX and ReSCo provide scalable, low cost security mechanisms that provide protection despite hostile, open, and mobile environments. When used together, with the addition of SoTru, the ideas presented in this dissertation can be used to enhance the effectiveness and seamlessness of security in dynamic systems.",pq_id,305176640,proquest_dt,NA,"Lagesse, Brent Jason",2009,THES,Ph.D.,reviewer2,Ali
,Distributed Trust Management In Autonomic Networks,"The management of autonomic networks has gained more and more attentions because of their wide applications and control difficulties. Autonomic networks are decentralized and self-organized. Without global knowledge on the states of autonomic networks, it is difficult to predict behaviors of such networks and thus to conduct proper network management and control. This dissertation is the starting point of my effort to theoretically understand the complex characteristics of autonomic networks. In particular, I focus on a specific application: distributed trust management.    We view trust among users as a set of relations established on the basis of trust credentials and required by specified policies. Two important components of a distributed trust management system are studied in this work: trust credential distribution and trust evaluation. In autonomic networks, trust credentials are distributed throughout the network. Given the mobility and dynamics of the networks, it is important to properly distribute trust credentials such that users are able to efficiently obtain required credentials and update existing credentials. I present a trust credential distribution scheme based on network coding. After obtaining credentials in need, policies are required for users to evaluate trustworthiness of targets in a distributed way. In this dissertation, I model distributed trust evaluation as an estimation problem and trust evaluation policies based on local interactions are studied. I investigate the convergence of both deterministic and stochastic voting rules and prove their effectiveness with the present of misbehaving users.    Autonomic networks rely on collaboration among users. The conflict between the benefit from collaboration and the required cost for collaboration naturally leads to game-theoretic studies. I study collaboration based on cooperative games with communication constraints and give the conditions under which users are willing to collaborate. The results in this dissertation show that a well-designed trust management system is helpful to enforce collaboration. Besides collaboration, I show that trust can be used to the utility optimization problems as well. The effect of trust values is that in the routing and scheduling problems the trustworthiness of the node will be automatically considered and used. For example, packets will not be routed frequently to suspicious nodes.",pq_id,304854171,proquest_dt,NA,"Jiang, Tao",2007,THES,Ph.D.,reviewer2,Ali
,Economic Incentive Mechanisms For User-Contributed Wireless Networks,"User-contributed wireless networks are formed by wireless devices that are owned by different users. They have been widely used to achieve better connectivity at places where an infrastructure is not immediately available or cannot be directly used. The functioning of the user-contributed wireless network depends on the cooperation of the nodes in the network. In civilian wireless networks, nodes often belong to different users who have their own interests and always want to maximize their benefits. Consequently, the user nodes may not want to behave cooperatively, if it does not suit their needs and interests. Like many distributed autonomous systems, user-contributed wireless networks have the common incentive problems such as the free-rider problem, where only a small portion of user nodes contribute their resources, and the adverse selection problem, where user nodes do not reveal their states truthfully. So, to ensure the functioning of user-contributed wireless networks, it is highly important to provide incentives for nodes to cooperate. Game theory is a nature tool to deal with the problem of selfish behavior. In our work, we adopt solution concepts from game theory to study important incentive problems in user-contributed wireless networks. We mainly focus on two categories of incentive problems: routing problems and spectrum sharing problems. For routing, we have done four works. First, we considered the traditional deterministic routing in user-contributed wireless ad hoc networks, and proposed a mechanism to prevent the user nodes from colluding. Second, we studied the incentive issues for opportunistic routing in user-contributed wireless mesh networks, and proposed mechanisms to stimulate nodes to truthfully reveal their link states, so that the most efficient routing decision can be reached. Third, we proposed the first bargaining-based incentive mechanism for probabilistic routing that stimulates selfish nodes to participate in message forwarding. Fourth, we proposed a strategy-proof mechanism to efficiently distribute data flows among node-disjoint paths obtained by multipath routing protocols. For spectrum sharing, we studied multi-radio multi-channel assignment problem in a single collision domain, and proposed an incentive mechanism to ensure the system converge to equilibrium, named strongly dominant strategy equilibrium. At the same time, this equilibrium state achieves optimal system throughput.",pq_id,305084774,proquest_dt,NA,"Wu, Fan",2009,THES,Ph.D.,reviewer2,Ali
,Evolving Visibly Intelligent Behavior For Embedded Game Agents,"Machine learning has proven useful for producing solutions to various problems, including the creation of controllers for autonomous intelligent agents. However, the control requirements for an intelligent agent sometimes go beyond the simple ability to complete a task, or even to complete it efficiently: An agent must sometimes complete a task in style. For example, if an autonomous intelligent agent is embedded in a game where it is visible to human observers, and plays a role that evokes human intuitions about how that role should be fulfilled, then the agent must fulfill that role in a manner that does not dispel the illusion of intelligence for the observers. Such visibly intelligent behavior is a subset of general intelligent behavior: a subset that we must be able to provide if our methods are to be adopted by the developers of games and simulators.    This dissertation continues the tradition of using neuroevolution to train artificial neural networks as controllers for agents embedded in strategy games or simulators, expanding that work to address selected issues of visibly intelligent behavior. A test environment is created and used to demonstrate that modified methods can create desirable behavioral traits such as flexibility, consistency, and adherence to a doctrine, and suppress undesirable traits such as seemingly erratic behavior and excessive predictability. These methods are designed to expand a program of work leading toward adoption of neuroevolution by the commercial gaming industry, increasing player satisfaction with their products, and perhaps helping to set AI forward as The Next Big Thing in that industry. As the capabilities of research-grade machine learning converge with the needs of the commercial gaming industry, work of this sort can be expected to expand into a broad and productive area of research into the nature of intelligence and the behavior of autonomous agents.",pq_id,304980155,proquest_dt,NA,"Bryant, Bobby Don",2006,THES,Ph.D.,reviewer2,Ali
,Modeling Natural Phenomena With Lattice Boltzmann Method,"We have adopted a numerical method in computational fluid dynamics, the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM), for simulation and visualization of natural phenomena. The LBM is an alternative and promising numerical scheme for modeling the fluid dynamics from a microscopic perspective, and recovering the Navier-Stokers equations. The LBM has the following obvious advantages: (1) it uses local and simple operators to model complex and nonlinear fluid behaviors; (2) it discretizes the micro-physics of local interactions between fluids and objects, and thus can handle very complex boundary conditions, such as deep urban canyons, curved walls, arbitrarily-shaped objects and dynamic boundaries of moving objects; (3) due to its discrete nature, the LBM lends itself to multi-resolution approaches, and its computational pattern, is easily parallelizable. In addition to the traditional Single-relaxation-time LBM, we introduce a more general version: the Multiple-relaxation-time LBM, which is more appropriate for coupling physical properties (temperature, body forces, etc.) to fluid dynamics and it provides more stable computation. We have applied this method to model light objects floating in the wind, heat shimmering of air, mirage, solid melting and flowing, and contaminant plume dispersion in urban environment. We have accelerated the LBM on commodity graphics processing units (GPUs), achieving interactive performance for our applications. Moreover, we have modelled the front spreading phenomena of fire and flows on 3D surfaces. Our method provides fast and simple simulations and allows users to conveniently control the propagation behaviors. Our LBM-based approaches provide a physically based framework for modeling and simulating natural phenomena that enables the development of computer graphics, movies, games, and scientific prediction simulations.",pq_id,304927658,proquest_dt,NA,"Zhao, Ye",2006,THES,Ph.D.,reviewer2,Ali

,Probabilistic Distributed Control,"Algorithms must not only allow autonomous entities to work together to accomplish some desired task, but it is often advantageous to must do so in a distributed manner. The latter criterion is critical. As the number of autonomous entities increases, it becomes increasingly unwieldy to coordinate them with a centralized controller due to scalability issues.    The natural question is thus ""What distributed control algorithm can we use for this purpose?"" As it turns out, in 1964 the mathematician M.L. Tsetlin devised a very elegant solution, which he called the Gur Game, to bring about ""optimality"" in a population of finite state automata without using a centralized controller. What is remarkable about his methodology is that it so closely parallels what we are trying to accomplish now with networks of computing entities. It is because of this that we have chosen to further investigate how the Gur Game can realize distributed control. Since the Gur Game works in a probabilistic manner, we will use the phrase ""probabilistic distributed control"" to describe this work. Indeed, it is the thesis of this dissertation that the Gur Game is an effective means to achieve probabilistic distributed control in many network applications.    In this dissertation, our first application of the Gur Game is to the problem of adjusting the resolution of active entities in ad hoc networks, such as sensor networks. We next present an extension of the Gur Game that we call the Hierarchical Gur Game. This Hierarchical Gur Game addresses some scalability issues associated with the baseline (flat) Gur Game. We next study how the Gur Game can be used in the domain of power control for ad hoc networks. Next, we examine the concept of the Gur Game duty cycle. Following that we explore what happens when we break the original Gur Game into separate, smaller games. We also demonstrate how allowing gurs to be mobile helps provide robustness in a tree hierarchy network. Finally, we analyze the Gur Game theoretically.",pq_id,304653068,proquest_dt,NA,"Iyer, Ranjit",2008,THES,Ph.D.,reviewer2,Ali
,Routing In Random Ad-Hoc Networks: Provably Better Than Worst-Case,"Wireless networks, such as sensor networks or general ad-hoc networks, present special challenges for routing problems due to high energy constraints, failures, and node autonomy. As such, traditional methods of constructing and fixing a centralized routing topology and then simply expecting nodes to forward accordingly in the absence of any further incentives to do so suffer reliability drawbacks. We look to light-weight and game-theoretic proposals based on random walks and game-theoretic techniques to deal with these reliability concerns. In particular, we consider random walks for information collection, path auctions for one-to-one routing, and a locally minimum cost forwarding game (LMCF) for all-to-one reverse multicast routing. For each of the three routing scenarios considered, a trade-off between reliability and efficiency is observed in the worst-cases: There exist wireless network configurations for which random walks take a maximally long expected time to visit all nodes, path auctions require maximal overpayments to ensure truthfulness, and any Nash equilibria for locally minimum cost forwarding are arbitrarily costlier than the global optimum. We further demonstrate NP-hardness results and approximation hardness results regarding computation of optimal truthful mechanisms and optimal Nash equilibria for the game-theoretic scenarios present. On the other hand, a clique is also a possible wireless network configuration formed by setting a large enough (broadcast radius, and the clique configuration demonstrates optimal efficiency for all three. The extreme downside to such a configuration, however, is that such a large broadcast radius would rapidly deplete the system's energy, yielding it completely infeasible. What becomes apparent then, is that the appropriate question to ask is the following: What is the efficiency of each of the three proposed methods for a typical wireless network of low broadcast radius'? Does a nicer structure tend to arise despite negative worst-case behavior for the reliable routing problems considered in this work on the relevant random models of wireless networks'? A central theme of this work is a resounding, theoretically sound ""Yes"" to that question for all three scenarios: We prove that each of the three proposed methods are almost always efficient under relevant, models and metrics models for wireless networks.",pq_id,304653320,proquest_dt,NA,"Ercal-Ozkaya, Gunes",2008,THES,Ph.D.,reviewer2,Ali

,"Impact Of Violence Exposure On Hostility, Physiological Arousal, And Health In Youth. Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B.","This study examined the joint effects of lifetime exposure to violence within the home and community and acute exposure to media violence on hostility, physiological arousal, and attitudes toward health risk behaviors. One hundred male undergraduates aged 18-21 who had previously reported low or high lifetime amounts of violence were randomly assigned to play a videogame low (The Simpsons: Hit and Run) or high (Grand Theft Auto III; GTA III) in violent content. Participants randomly assigned to GTA III exhibited greater changes in systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure from the initial rest period to game play, and greater negative affect subsequent to game play, in comparison to adolescents randomly assigned to The Simpsons. Participants randomly assigned to GTA III also exhibited more permissive attitudes towards drinking alcohol and using marijuana and were more competitive during a subsequent task. Greater lifetime violence exposure was associated with greater changes in SBP and pulse rate from the initial rest period to game play and with more permissive attitudes towards violence and drinking alcohol. Two interactions between lifetime violence exposure and laboratory media violence condition were found. Within the low lifetime violence exposure group, videogame condition was not associated with change in SBP from the initial rest period to game play, while within the high lifetime violence exposure group, play of Grand Theft Auto III predicted greater changes in SBP. Lifetime community violence exposure interacted with laboratory media violence condition in predicting hostile attributions. Within the high community violence exposure group, play of GTA III was associated with greater likelihood that participants would think a teacher would accuse them of cheating. The present study is the first experimental study to show that media violence is associated with permissive attitudes towards health risk behaviors that do not directly involve hostility or aggression, such as alcohol and marijuana use. Media violence effects observed in the laboratory may be representative of how any type of violence exposure influences youth, including real-world violence within homes and communities. One consequence of acute or chronic violence exposure among young men may be a greater willingness to engage in generally risky behavior.",no_id,anderson2010_80,anderson2010,"Brady, S. (2006).

,Television And Video Game Violence: Age Differences And The Combined Effects Of Passive And Interactive Violent Media. Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B.,"The present research examined the combined effects of violent video games and violent TV programs on third and sixth-grade boys’ thoughts and behavior. In individual sessions, demographic information about the children’s television viewing and video game playing habits was collected. Participants were exposed to one of six following media conditions for 15 minutes; a) watch a violent (wrestling) or a nonviolent video segment (basketball), b) play a violent or a non-violent game, or c) watch a violent or non-violent video segment and then play a video game containing the same characters and content. The potential for violent media to prime aggression was examined by utilizing two cognitive (word-stem completion task and normative beliefs about aggression questionnaire) and one behavioral measure (Bobo doll interaction). Exposure to violent media was expected to lead to increased aggressive thoughts and behaviors in both younger and older children. Younger children were expected to be more strongly influenced by violent media than older children. However, older boys were expected to demonstrate greater priming on the word-completion task. Finally, consistent with Huesmann’s (1986) social developmental theory, the combination of violent video games and violent television content was expected influence children more strongly than either video games or television alone. Key findings of the present research were as follows: 1) Children exposed to violent media content endorsed higher levels of aggressive behavior than did children exposed to non-violent content. 2) Children exposed to violence in the combined media condition endorsed significantly higher levels of aggressive behavior than did those in the non-violent media condition. 3) Sixth-grade boys endorsed higher levels of aggressive behavior and produced more aggressive words on the word-stem completion task than did third-grade boys. 4) Third-grade boys were more aggressive toward the Bobo doll than were sixth-grade boys.",no_id,anderson2010_131,anderson2010,"Meyers, K.

,The Effects Of Shared Activity On Dyadic Stress Response.,"Scope and Method of Study: The purpose of this study was to assess sex differences in stress responses to cooperative and competitive activities within same-sex dyads. Participants included 90 undergraduate college students. Salivary cortisol (CORT) was collected as a measure of stress reactivity in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Salivary alpha- amylase (sAA) was collected as a measure of stress reactivity in the sympathetic nervous system. Findings and Conclusions: Data were analyzed using a 2 X 2 analysis of variance, with condition (cooperative activity, competitive activity) and sex (male, female) as independent variables and salivary cortisol (CORT) and alpha-amylase (sAA) as the dependent variables. Results indicated a significant interaction between sex and condition for change in CORT from time 1 (baseline measurement) to time 2 (measurement immediately following shared activity). There was a significant difference in rate of CORT change from time 1 to time 2 for women in cooperative condition compared to the competitive condition. Specifically, women engaging in cooperative activity showed greater decreases in CORT from time 1 to time 2 than women engaging in competitive activity. There was no significant change in CORT for men during cooperative or competitive activity. No significant effects of condition or sex on sAA were observed.",no_id,nagy2015_4,nagy2015,"Oklahoma State University, Stillwater","Auer, B. J. B.",2011,NA,NA,reviewer2,Ali
,The Physical And Emotional Experience Of Violence In Video Games. Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B.,"Despite a considerable amount of speculation regarding the psychological significance of violence in video games, the research literature has yet to present a clear understanding of its consequence. The present research sought to develop increased understanding of video game violence through focus on two poorly understood areas of the literature: (Study 1) the relationship between violence, physiological arousal and attitudes toward guns and violence; (Study 2) the influence of violence on the way boys perceive goodness and badness. In order to address both research areas, 45 boys, ranging in age from 16-19 were randomly assigned to one of three separate groups that would be exposed to differing levels of video game violence. They were provided questionnaires before playing the games that assessed: (a) attitudes toward guns and violence; (b) thoughts and feelings on goodness and badness, and (c) video gaming habits. A week later, baseline measures of arousal (heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure) were obtained for each participant prior to game play. After playing a non-violent game or another game with violence features turned on or off, each participant had a post heart rate blood pressure reading taken and completed a post survey on goodness and badness. The results of Study 1 did not find significant change in heart rate or blood pressure for either the control condition or for the groups exposed to differing levels of violence over a 30 minute game play period. Furthermore, there was no evidence that attitudes toward guns and violence or race influenced physiological response. In the context of the literature on arousal, the results suggest that arousal as a factor of violence does occur though it is ephemeral. Study 2 sought to explore whether violence in video games might be a venue for adolescents to explore ethical self-development; and whether this exploration may be evident in how they articulate goodness and badness. Although statistically significant change was noted on individual survey questions, overall, change was minimal. While the results do not support the proposed theoretical model, further suggestions for exploration are discussed.",no_id,anderson2010_93,anderson2010,The Sciences and Engineering,"Dubenitz, J.",2005,THES,NA,reviewer2,Ali
