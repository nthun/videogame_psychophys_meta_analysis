,"""Baby On Board"": Reducing Risk Taking In Adult Drivers In A Simulated Driving Game","Two studies examined the effects of different socio-affective factors on risk driving behaviour. In Experiment 1, 87 adult drivers we asked to play a computer-based driving game after being exposed to a series of images that depicted infants, police or neutral information (control condition). In Experiment 2 we tested a further 60 adult drivers. We found a significant effect of our manipulation on driving behaviour, with performance being significantly less risky in the infant condition than in the police and control conditions. In addition, this advantage was not simply due to variations in emotions typically associated with infant pictures. The results of this study highlight the importance of studying the role of socio-affective context when investigating factors that influence driving behaviour. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.aap.2012.06.031,Scopus,Accident Analysis and Prevention,"Mammarella N., Fairfield B., Di Domenico A., Di Fiore T.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,"""Bouncing Back"" From A Loss: Entrepreneurial Orientation, Emotions, And Failure Narratives","In this study, we explore how failure in the form of the first lost game of the college football season for a team influences specific content within the narratives constructed regarding that loss and how those narratives are associated with subsequent performance. Building on theoretical perspectives regarding sports management, entrepreneurial orientation (EO), emotions, and the use of narratives for sensemaking, we develop and test an EO-related sports management model of failure narratives. Using computer-aided text analysis of transcripts from head coaches' press conferences directly following their team's first loss of the season as well as regression analysis, we found that the narrative's EO content has a U-shaped relationship with subsequent (i.e., next game) performance. Additionally, negative emotional content had a similar U-shaped relationship with subsequent performance. Finally, positive emotional content exhibited an inverse U-shaped relationship with subsequent performance. We discuss the implications of these results on the literatures regarding EO, emotions, and sports management as well as possible avenues for future research. © 2013 Baylor University.",doi,10.1111/etap.12057,Scopus,Entrepreneurship: Theory and Practice,"Wolfe M.T., Shepherd D.A.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,"""I Know That You Know How I Feel"": Behavioral And Physiological Signals Demonstrate Emotional Attunement While Interacting With A Computer Simulating Emotional Intelligence","Human-human communication studies have suggested that within communicative interactions, individuals acknowledge each other as intentional agents and adjust their emotion nonverbal behavior according to the other. This process has been defined as emotional attunement. In this study, we examine the emotional attunement process in the context of affective human-computer interactions. To this purpose, participants were exposed to one of two conditions. In one case, they played with a computer that simulated understanding of their emotional reactions while guiding them across four different game-like activities; in the other, the computer guided participants across the activities without mentioning any ability to understand emotional responses. Face movements, gaze direction, posture, vocal behavior, electrocardiogram and electrodermal activity were simultaneously recorded during the experimental sessions. Results showed that if participants were aware of interacting with an agent able to recognize their emotions, they reported that the computer was able to ""understand"" them and showed a higher number of nonverbal behaviors during the most interactive activity. The implications are discussed. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",doi,10.1007/s10919-014-0180-6,Scopus,Journal of Nonverbal Behavior,"Balzarotti S., Piccini L., Andreoni G., Ciceri R.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,‘Present Yet Absent’: Negotiating Commitment And Intimacy In Life With An Excessive Online Role Gamer,"The study examines how persons in a close relationship with a gamer of massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPG) perceive relationship problems caused by the gaming hobby. Revisiting the concept of pure relationships by Anthony Giddens, we analysed eight deep interviews with persons who claim their relationship with the gamer had ended or turned downhill due to the volume of the gaming. The study formulates a conception of the clashes of interest in areas of (1) situational clashes in everyday choreography, (2) shifts in long view prioritizing, (3) deficient communication and (4) understandings of self and autonomy in relation to gaming and relationship. These conceptual paths serve to understand the problems from a sociological perspective. On a more general level, the study demonstrates the timeliness in devoting attention to the premises under which intimacy and commitment are negotiated in offline and online relationship constellations. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.",doi,10.1177/1461444816636091,Scopus,New Media and Society,"Hellman M., Karjalainen S.-M., Majamäki M.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,3-D Streaming Supplying Partner Protocols For Mobile Collaborative Exergaming For Health,"Childhood obesity is nowadays considered one of the major health problems that many societies suffer from today. The obesity epidemic leads to several life threatening conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, and mental health problems like depression, anxiety, and loneliness just to mention a few. Several approaches, including physical exercises, strict diet, and exergames among others, have been adopted to address the obesity epidemic. Exergames are considered the innovative approach for fighting several health problems such as obesity, where a combination of exercise and 3-D gaming are proposed to incite kids to exercise as a team. Collaborative exergaming became even more popular given that it addresses the social side of the obesity epidemic, and it motivates kids to socialize with other kids. Traditional exergames are based on the client-server approach where the server is responsible for streaming the 3-D environment. However, this can lead to latency and server bottleneck if many clients participate in the exergame, which leads to the kids stopping exercising. Having an exergame application that does not suffer from networking problem such as delay, is very important given that it increases the exercise hours. In this paper, we propose a new trend of mobile collaborative exergaming applications that is based on the peer-to-peer architecture, as well as two supplying partner selection protocols that aim at selecting the suitable source responsible for streaming the relevant 3-D data. Our system, that we refer to as MOSAIC, is intended for mobile collaborative exergames that incite kids to move inside a large area, using thin mobile devices such as head-mounted devices, have physical exercises, and collaborate with other kids which in consequence address several health problems such as the obesity epidemic on the physical and social plans. Our proposed mobile collaborative exergame aims at inciting the kids to exercise as a team for a longer time by improving the quality of the streaming and reducing the delay. This is accomplished by our proposed supplying partner selection protocols that provide a quick discovery of multiple supplying partners, by minimizing the time required to acquire the data. The performance evaluation that we have obtained to evaluate our suite of protocols using a realistic set of exergame scenarios for obese kids is then presented and discussed. © 1997-2012 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TITB.2012.2206116,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine,"Maamar H.R., Boukerche A., Petriu E.M.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,A Bioinspired Approach For A Multizone Temperature Control System,"Bioinspired design approaches seek to exploit nature in order to construct optimal solutions for engineering problems as uniform temperature control in multizone systems. The ideal free distribution (IFD) is a concept from behavioural ecology, which describes the arrangement of individuals in different habitats such that at equilibrium, all habitats are equally suitable. Here, we relax the IFD's main assumptions using the standing-crop idea to introduce dynamics into the supplies of each habitat. Then, we make an analogy with a multizone thermal system to propose a controller based on the replicator dynamics model, in order to obtain a maximum uniform temperature subject to constant power injection. Besides, we analytically show that the equilibrium point of the controlled system is asymptotically stable. Finally, some practical results obtained with a testbed and comparisons with the theoretical results are presented. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.",doi,10.1088/1748-3182/6/1/016007,Scopus,Bioinspiration and Biomimetics,"Pantoja A., Quijano N., Leirens S.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,A Case Of Massive Pulmonary Thromboembolism In A Young Man Attribute To Computer Gaming,"Pulmonary thromboembolism occurs in old patients with risk factors, such as, immobilization, chronic medical disease, trauma, a hereditary hypercoagulable state, and others. However, we experienced a young man with a massive pulmonary thromboembolism attributed to immobilization due to computer gaming. The patient had been playing computer games in a seated position for at least five hour continually, and for twelve hours per day over a two-week period. The 36-year-old patient was transferred to our institute rule out the possibility of an acute myocardial infarction. Computer tomography revealed intraluminal filling defects in the distal main pulmonary artery and the left popliteal vein. He received thrombolytic therapy and subsequently recovered without complications. This case raises the possibility that prolonged computer gaming is a risk factor of thromboembolism in young adults.

,A Comparative Investigation Of Non-Linear Activation Functions In Neural Controllers For Search-Based Game Ai Engineering,"The creation of intelligent video game controllers has recently become one of the greatest challenges in game artificial intelligence research, and it is arguably one of the fastest-growing areas in game design and development. The learning process, a very important feature of intelligent methods, is the result of an intelligent game controller to determine and control the game objects behaviors' or actions autonomously. Our approach is to use a more efficient learning model in the form of artificial neural networks for training the controllers. We propose a Hill-Climbing Neural Network (HillClimbNet) that controls the movement of the Ms. Pac-man agent to travel around the maze, gobble all of the pills and escape from the ghosts in the maze. HillClimbNet combines the hill-climbing strategy with a simple, feed-forward artificial neural network architecture. The aim of this study is to analyze the performance of various activation functions for the purpose of generating neural-based controllers to play a video game. Each non-linear activation function is applied identically for all the nodes in the network, namely log-sigmoid, logarithmic, hyperbolic tangent-sigmoid and Gaussian. In general, the results shows an optimum configuration is achieved by using log-sigmoid, while Gaussian is the worst activation function.©Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.",doi,10.1007/s10462-011-9294-y,Scopus,Artificial Intelligence Review,"Tan T.G., Teo J., Anthony P.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia

,"A Comparison Of Energy Expenditure During ""Wii Boxing"" Versus Heavy Bag Boxing In Young Adults","Traditional computer videogames are sedentary, whereas new computer videogames, such as the Nintendo® (Redmond, WA) ""Wii™ Sports"" games, allow users to physically interact while playing the sport. Energy expenditure (EE), heart rate (HR), and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) during heavy bag boxing versus the Nintendo ""Wii Boxing"" game were compared. Fifteen males and 14 females (mean age, 25.6 years; height, 171.3 cm; weight, 71.8 kg) randomly selected (by a coin toss) heavy bag boxing or ""Wii Boxing"" for their first test session and completed the other protocol at their second session at least 2 days later. Each session lasted for a total duration of 30 minutes and consisted of 10 3-minute exercise bouts with measurements of HR, RPE, and EE obtained from indirect calorimetry. A paired-samples t test was used to analyze the results. Significant differences were found for HR (bag, 156 beats per minute; Wii, 138 beats per minute; P=0.001) and RPE (bag, 13.8; Wii, 11.4; P=0.0001) but not for EE (bag, 8.0 kcal/minute; Wii, 7.1 kcal/minute; bag, 241 total kcal; Wii, 213 total kcal; P=0.078). The results suggest that computer active videogames, such as the Nintendo Wii, have the potential to provide similar EE as their traditional forms of exercise and may be a sufficient replacement for traditional target HR zone activities, especially in less fit individuals. Further research is needed to compare EE for different ""Wii Sports"" games with those for their traditional forms of exercise. © Copyright 2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2014.",doi,10.1089/g4h.2013.0059,Scopus,Games for Health Journal,"Perusek K., Sparks K., Little K., Motley M., Patterson S., Wieand J.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,A Computer Game-Based Method For Studying Bullying And Cyberbullying,"Even though previous studies have addressed the relation between face-to-face bullying and cyberbullying, none have studied both phenomena simultaneously. In this article, we present a computer game-based method to study both types of peer aggression among youth. Study participants included fifth graders (N = 93) in two U.S. Midwestern middle schools. Students completed a self-report survey that included measures of aggression, bullying, emotions, and perceptions of school. Next, students were assigned to teams of four and completed both competitive and collaborative games. Results indicated significant correlations between survey measures and in-game interactions and showed that bistrategic players scored higher in relational aggression. These results contribute to the understanding of how face-to-face aggression relates to aggression in computer-mediated communication in middle-school students. ©, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",doi,10.1080/15388220.2014.963593,Scopus,Journal of School Violence,"Mancilla-Caceres J.F., Espelage D., Amir E.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,A Methodology Of Integrating Knowledge Into Applied Game And Validation Of Education And Entertainment Effects,"Applied game aims to help player accumulate knowledge, improve skills, or enhance emotion quotient through game playing process. Although many applied games have been developed in education and training fields, the solution on issues of balance between education and entertainment is still open. This study proposes a methodology for integrating knowledge with applied game combining recreational functions and pedagogic effect. For the purpose, the unified representation based on ontology is employed for game elements, game challenge model and knowledge expression with which the relationship mapping mechanism from diverse categories of knowledge onto game atomic element, especially primary rule, is constructed. As a result, a practical design technique that facilitates to import knowledge into applied game is achieved. In order to verify the practicability, a case of applied game, Qbaby Picture Matching game is designed and developed based on the proposed method. It has been running online and applied in a kindergarten. Moreover, an experiment is performed to identify the effects of education and entertainment. The results imply that the game can definitely produce recreational functions and pedagogic effect. The fact indirectly verifies that the methodology may effectively integrate knowledge with game thereby providing a referable solution for issues of education and entertainment balance. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2016.",doi,10.1007/978-3-662-50544-1_2,Scopus,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),"Wang Q., Chen H., Li J., Zhu D.",2016,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,A Motivational Framework For Analyzing Player And Virtual Agent Behavior,"Today's digital entertainment industry uses different approaches to establish believable agents with personality and to analyze the goal-directed behavior of game players. Academic research in this area usually focuses on one facet of personality - for example, only on emotions or character traits. The techniques applied to create non-player characters can hardly be used to analyze player interactions or choices in a computer game. The present study proposes a motivational framework to predict goal-directed behavior of both player and non-player characters in a computer game and explores the opportunities of using a Player and Agent Personality Database (PAPD) based on the same motivational framework to design virtual agents with personality. This article claims that motivation to reach a goal is influenced by both situational and personal factors that are represented with an equation that determines the likelihood of the occurrence of a behavior. The framework represented by this study takes into account psychological needs, interactions between these needs, general behavioral patterns, lower-order and higher-order personality traits for analyzing gaming experiences and player/non-player choices in a computer game. © 2010 International Federation for Information Processing.",doi,10.1016/j.entcom.2010.09.002,Scopus,Entertainment Computing,Bostan B.,2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,A Multi-Functional Entertaining And Educational Robot,"This paper presents a multi-functional autonomous intelligent robot, DOC-1, which has actions exclusively driven by artificial intelligence programs. The mechanism of this robot was designed to fulfill tasks defined by various functions such as gripping character cubes and teacups, playing the Gobang board game, and rotating and stacking character cubes. Further emphasis was placed on load lifting capability, weight reduction, energy conservation, and performance reliability. The serial port of a minicomputer is used as the communication interface between the software and electromechanical components. A custom-made chip serves as the control kernel that controls the motions of servo motors that move the arms and head of the robot, two DC motors which drive the wheels, and also a number of lights.

,A Musical System For Emotional Expression,"The automatic control of emotional expression in music is a challenge that is far from being solved. This paper describes research conducted with the aim of developing a system with such capabilities. The system works with standard MIDI files and develops in two stages: the first offline, the second online. In the first stage, MIDI files are partitioned in segments with uniform emotional content. These are subjected to a process of features extraction, then classified according to emotional values of valence and arousal and stored in a music base. In the second stage, segments are selected and transformed according to the desired emotion and then arranged in song-like structures. The system is using a knowledge base, grounded on empirical results of works of Music Psychology that was refined with data obtained with questionnaires; we also plan to use data obtained with other methods of emotional recognition in a near future. For the experimental setups, we prepared web-based questionnaires with musical segments of different emotional content. Each subject classified each segment after listening to it, with values for valence and arousal. The modularity, adaptability and flexibility of our system's architecture make it applicable in various contexts like video-games, theater, films and healthcare contexts. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

,A Neural Marker Of Costly Punishment Behavior,"Human readiness to incur personal costs to punish norm violators is a key force in the maintenance of social norms. The willingness to punish is, however, characterized by vast individual heterogeneity that is poorly understood. In fact, this heterogeneity has so far defied explanations in terms of individual-level demographic or psychological variables. Here, we use resting electroencephalography, a stable measure of individual differences in cortical activity, to show that a highly specific neural marker-baseline cortical activity in the right prefrontal cortex-predicts individuals' punishment behavior. The analysis of task-independent individual variation in cortical baseline activity provides a new window into the neurobiology of decision making by bringing dispositional neural markers to the forefront of the analysis. © The Author(s) 2010.",doi,10.1177/0956797609360750,Scopus,Psychological Science,"Knoch D., Gianotti L.R.R., Baumgartner T., Fehr E.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,"A Pilot Randomized, Controlled Trial Of An Active Video Game Physical Activity Intervention","Objective: Active video games (AVGs) transform the sedentary screen time of video gaming into active screen time and have great potential to serve as a ""gateway"" tool to a more active lifestyle for the least active individuals. This pilot randomized trial was conducted to explore the potential of theory-guided active video games in increasing moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) among young adults. Method: In this pilot 4-week intervention, participants were randomly assigned to 1 of the following groups: an AVG group with all the self determination theory (SDT)-based game features turned off, an AVG group with all the SDT-based game features turned on, a passive gameplay group with all the SDT-based game features turned on, and a control group. Physical activity was measured using ActiGraph GT3X accelerometers. Other outcomes included attendance and perceived need satisfaction of autonomy, competence and relatedness. Results: It was found that playing the self-determination theory supported AVG resulted in greater MVPA compared with the control group immediately postintervention. The AVG with the theory-supported features also resulted in greater attendance and psychological need satisfaction than the non-theory-supported one. Conclusion: An AVG designed with motivation theory informed features positively impacted attendance and MVPA immediately postintervention, suggesting that including AVG features guided with motivation theory may be a method of addressing common problems with adherence and increasing effectiveness of active gaming. © 2015 American Psychological Association.",doi,10.1037/hea0000302,Scopus,Health Psychology,"Peng W., Pfeiffer K.A., Winn B., Lin J.-H., Suton D.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,A Pilot Study Using The Xbox Kinect For Exercise Conditioning In Sedentary Female University Students,"BACKGROUND: There is little research exploring training effects of engaging in active video gaming activities. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine the cardiovascular and metabolic responses, changes in flexibility and exercise adherence to an aerobic dance exercise programme using the XBOX Kinect over a 6 week training period. METHODS: Training was conducted using the Just Dance 4 disc on the XBOX Kinect 360. Participants attended five, 30 minute sessions per week for the first two weeks, four 45 minute sessions per week for the next two weeks and three 60 minute sessions per week for the last two weeks. Outcomes assessed included flexibility, body mass index (BMI), percentage body fat, maximal oxygen consumption (VO<inf>2max</inf>), resting and post exercise blood pressure, heart rate and blood lactate levels. RESULTS: There were significant improvements in flexibility, maximal oxygen consumption and resting heart rate. There were no significant changes in BMI, percentage body fat or blood lactate levels. Nine (37.5%) participants continued to engage in this form of exercise at least 3-days per week over the 3-month post intervention follow-up period. CONCLUSION: Engaging in dancing using dance videogames can lead to improved cardiovascular conditioning and flexibility in sedentary female university students. © 2015 IOS Press and the authors.

,A Pilot Study With A Novel Setup For Collaborative Play Of The Humanoid Robot Kaspar With Children With Autism,"This article describes a pilot study in which a novel experimental setup, involving an autonomous humanoid robot, KASPAR, participating in a collaborative, dyadic video game, was implemented and tested with children with autism, all of whom had impairments in playing socially and communicating with others. The children alternated between playing the collaborative video game with a neurotypical adult and playing the same game with the humanoid robot, being exposed to each condition twice. The equipment and experimental setup were designed to observe whether the children would engage in more collaborative behaviours while playing the video game and interacting with the adult than performing the same activities with the humanoid robot. The article describes the development of the experimental setup and its first evaluation in a small-scale exploratory pilot study. The purpose of the study was to gain experience with the operational limits of the robot as well as the dyadic video game, to determine what changes should be made to the systems, and to gain experience with analyzing the data from this study in order to conduct a more extensive evaluation in the future. Based on our observations of the childrens' experiences in playing the cooperative game, we determined that while the children enjoyed both playing the game and interacting with the robot, the game should be made simpler to play as well as more explicitly collaborative in its mechanics. Also, the robot should be more explicit in its speech as well as more structured in its interactions. Results show that the children found the activity to be more entertaining, appeared more engaged in playing, and displayed better collaborative behaviours with their partners (For the purposes of this article, 'partner' refers to the human/robotic agent which interacts with the children with autism. We are not using the term's other meanings that refer to specific relationships or emotional involvement between two individuals.) in the second sessions of playing with human adults than during their first sessions. One way of explaining these findings is that the children's intermediary play session with the humanoid robot impacted their subsequent play session with the human adult. However, another longer and more thorough study would have to be conducted in order to better re-interpret these findings. Furthermore, although the children with autism were more interested in and entertained by the robotic partner, the children showed more examples of collaborative play and cooperation while playing with the human adult. © 2013 The Author(s).",doi,10.1007/s12369-013-0195-x,Scopus,International Journal of Social Robotics,"Wainer J., Dautenhahn K., Robins B., Amirabdollahian F.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,A Randomized Study Of Cognitive Remediation For Forensic And Mental Health Patients With Schizophrenia,"Cognitive remediation has proven efficacy for improving neurocognition in people with schizophrenia. The current study evaluated the benefits of cognitive remediation on neurocognition, functioning, psychotic symptoms, and aggression in a sample of forensic and mental health patients. Care recipients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (N=78) receiving services in the forensic and mental health units of a state hospital were randomized to participate in cognitive remediation versus computer games control activities. Participants' neurocognition, functional capacity, experiential recovery, psychotic symptoms, and aggression incidents were assessed at baseline and posttreatment. Cognitive remediation was associated with improvements in several neurocognitive domains and circumscribed domains of functional capacity. People assigned to cognitive remediation experiences greater reductions in negative symptoms, agitation/excitement, and verbal and physical aggression. In addition to improving neurocognition in long-term hospitalized forensic and mental health patients, cognitive remediation may enhance efforts at reducing negative symptoms, emotion dysregulation, and aggression incidents. Forensic settings may represent a new frontier for the clinical dissemination of cognitive remediation. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.jpsychires.2015.05.013,Scopus,Journal of Psychiatric Research,"Ahmed A.O., Hunter K.M., Goodrum N.M., Batten N.-J., Birgenheir D., Hardison E., Dixon T., Buckley P.F.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,A Selective Meta-Analysis On The Relative Incidence Of Discrete Affective States During Learning With Technology,"The last decade has witnessed considerable interest in the investigation of the affective dimensions of learning and in the development of advanced learning technologies that automatically detect and respond to student affect. Identifying the affective states that students experience in technology-enhanced learning contexts is a fundamental question in this area. This article provides an initial attempt to answer this question with a selective meta-analysis of 24 studies that utilized a mixture of methodologies (online self-reports, online observations, emote-aloud protocols, cued recall) and affect judges (students themselves, untrained peers, trained judges) for fine-grained monitoring of 14 discrete affective states of 1,740 middle school, high school, college, and adult students in 5 countries. Affective states occurred over the course of interactions with a range of learning technologies, including intelligent tutoring systems, serious games, simulation environments, and simple computer interfaces. Standardized effect sizes of relative frequency, computed by comparing the proportional occurrence of each affective state to the other states in each study, were modeled with random-effects models. Engagement/flow was consistently found to be relatively frequent (d+ = 2.5), and contempt, anger, disgust, sadness, anxiety, delight, fear, and surprise were consistently infrequent, with d+ ranging from -6.5 to -0.78. Effects for boredom (d+ = 0.19), confusion (d+ = 0.12), curiosity (d+ = -0.10), happiness (d+ = -0.13), and frustration (d+ = -2.5) varied substantially across studies. Mixed-effects models indicated that the source of the affect judgments (self vs. observers) and the authenticity of the learning contexts (classroom vs. laboratory) accounted for greater heterogeneity than the use of advanced learning technologies and training time. Theoretical and applied implications of the findings are discussed. © 2013 American Psychological Association.",doi,10.1037/a0032674,Scopus,Journal of Educational Psychology,D'Mello S.,2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia

,A Simulation For A Predator To Pursuit A Prey Based On Energy,"For the predator-prey model, most conventional researches have focused on the food chain. In recent computer game and movies, simulation of natural phenomena has been increased. Realistic simulation is a key to the simulation of natural phenomena. It also comes in as an important role when simulating predator-prey chasing. Various factors must be put into consideration - such as physical condition, emotion of the predator, and the environment of the pursuit - when creating a realistic simulation of predator-prey chasing. It is not easy to simulate by reflecting all factors independently. Thus, this paper assumes that these independent variables are converted in terms of energy for the pursuit. It will simulate the situation of a predator chasing a prey using the ""energy for the pursuit"". To do this, we proposed the consumed energy by using steering force based on Newton's law and the needed energy based on physics theory for a predator to move a distance as maximum velocity. A number of experiments were conducted in order to show the correctness of the proposed energies. Through experiments, this paper illustrates that the proposed energy models are well suited for natural pursuit. © 2014 SERSC.",doi,10.14257/ijmue.2014.9.4.16,Scopus,International Journal of Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering,Lee J.M.,2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,A Statistically Rigorous Analysis Of 2D Path-Planning Algorithms,"Path-planning is a well-known studied problem in Artificial Intelligence. Given two points in a map, path-planning algorithms search for a path that joins those two points, avoiding obstacles. It is a challenging problem with important practical applications in a wide range of applications: autonomous mobile robotics, logistics or video games, just to mention some of them. Given its importance, it has attracted much research, resulting in a large number of algorithms, some classical, such as A∗, other more specialized, such as swarms. However, despite all the literature dedicated to this problem, the statistics used to analyze experimental results in most cases are naïve. In this paper, we position in favor of the need of incorporating stronger statistical methods in path-planning empirical research and promote a debate in the research community. To this end, we analyze some 2D-grid classical path-planning algorithms in discrete domains (i.e. A∗ and A∗ with post-processing) and more recent algorithms in continuous domains (i.e. Theta∗ and S-Theta∗).

,"A Study Investigating The Acute Dose-Response Effects Of 13 Mg And 17 Mg Δ 9- Tetrahydrocannabinol On Cognitive-Motor Skills, Subjective And Autonomic Measures In Regular Users Of Marijuana","Heavy use of marijuana is claimed to damage critical skills related to short-term memory, visual scanning and attention. Motor skills and driving safety may be compromised by the acute effects of marijuana. The aim of this study was to investigate the acute effects of 13 mg and 17 mg Δ 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on skills important for coordinated movement and driving and on subjective and autonomic measures in regular users of marijuana. Fourteen regular users of marijuana were enrolled. Each subject was tested on two separate days. On each test day, subjects smoked two low-nicotine cigarettes, one with and the other without THC. Seventeen mg THC was included in the cigarette on one test day and 13 mg on the other day. The sequence of cigarette types was unknown to the subject. During smoking, heart rate and blood pressure were monitored, and the subjects performed a virtual reality maze task requiring attention and motor coordination, followed by 3 other cognitive tasks (Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), a ""gambling"" task and estimation of time and distance from an approaching car). After smoking a cigarette with 17 mg THC, regular marijuana users hit the walls more often on the virtual maze task than after smoking cigarettes without THC; this effect was not seen in patients after they smoked cigarettes with 13 mg THC. Performance in the WCST was affected with 17 mg THC and to a lesser extent with the use of 13 mg THC. Decision making in the gambling task was affected after smoking cigarettes with 17 mg THC, but not with 13 m THC. Smoking cigarettes with 13 and 17 mg THC increased subjective ratings of pleasure and satisfaction, drug ""effect"" and drug ""high"". Thes findings imply that smoking of 17 mg THC results in impairment of cognitive-motor skills that could be important for coordinated movemen and driving, whereas the lower dose of 13 mg THC appears to cause less impairment of such skills in regular users of marijuana. © 2008 British Association for Psychopharmacology.",doi,10.1177/0269881108088194,Scopus,Journal of Psychopharmacology,"Weinstein A., Brickner O., Lerman H., Greemland M., Bloch M., Lester H., Chisin R., Sarne Y., Mechoulam R., Bar-Hamburger R., Freedman N., Even-Sapir E.",2008,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Action Video Game Players' Visual Search Advantage Extends To Biologically Relevant Stimuli,"Research investigating the effects of action video game experience on cognition has demonstrated a host of performance improvements on a variety of basic tasks. Given the prevailing evidence that these benefits result from efficient control of attentional processes, there has been growing interest in using action video games as a general tool to enhance everyday attentional control. However, to date, there is little evidence indicating that the benefits of action video game playing scale up to complex settings with socially meaningful stimuli - one of the fundamental components of our natural environment. The present experiment compared action video game player (AVGP) and non-video game player (NVGP) performance on an oculomotor capture task that presented participants with face stimuli. In addition, the expression of a distractor face was manipulated to assess if action video game experience modulated the effect of emotion. Results indicate that AVGPs experience less oculomotor capture than NVGPs; an effect that was not influenced by the emotional content depicted by distractor faces. It is noteworthy that this AVGP advantage emerged despite participants being unaware that the investigation had to do with video game playing, and participants being equivalent in their motivation and treatment of the task as a game. The results align with the notion that action video game experience is associated with superior attentional and oculomotor control, and provides evidence that these benefits can generalize to more complex and biologically relevant stimuli. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",doi,10.1016/j.actpsy.2015.06.001,Scopus,Acta Psychologica,"Chisholm J.D., Kingstone A.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Active Video Game Exercise Training Improves The Clinical Control Of Asthma In Children: Randomized Controlled Trial,"Objective The aim of the present study was to determine whether aerobic exercise involving an active video game system improved asthma control, airway inflammation and exercise capacity in children with moderate to severe asthma. Design A randomized, controlled, single-blinded clinical trial was carried out. Thirty-six children with moderate to severe asthma were randomly allocated to either a video game group (VGG; N = 20) or a treadmill group (TG; n = 16). Both groups completed an eight-week supervised program with two weekly 40-minute sessions. Pre-training and post-training evaluations involved the Asthma Control Questionnaire, exhaled nitric oxide levels (FeNO), maximum exercise testing (Bruce protocol) and lung function. Results No differences between the VGG and TG were found at the baseline. Improvements occurred in both groups with regard to asthma control and exercise capacity. Moreover, a significant reduction in FeNO was found in the VGG (p < 0.05). Although the mean energy expenditure at rest and during exercise training was similar for both groups, the maximum energy expenditure was higher in the VGG. Conclusion The present findings strongly suggest that aerobic training promoted by an active video game had a positive impact on children with asthma in terms of clinical control, improvementin their exercise capacity and a reductionin pulmonary inflammation.

,"Active Video Games And Physical Activity Recommendations: A Comparison Of The Gamercize Stepper, Xbox Kinect And Xavix J-Mat","Objectives: The current study was designed to evaluate the intensity levels of three exergames and determine the association with physical activity recommendations that correspond to specific outcomes. The variation in cardiovascular responses between the three exergames was also examined. Design: We employed a cross-sectional laboratory design. Methods: We recruited 18 girls to participate in a peak VO2 test and to play Gamercize, Kinect River Rush, XaviX J-Mat at three separate exergaming sessions. Linear regression equations of heart rate and percentage of peak VO2 were calculated for each participant to determine the intensity of exergame play. Differences in intensity between the three exergames and time spent in the recommended moderate (heart rate at ≥55% peak VO2) and vigorous (heart rate at ≥75% peak VO2) intensity levels were analyzed. We calculated the coefficient of variation for the mean heart rate to determine the difference in variance in heart rate values for the three exergames. Results: When playing Gamercize and Kinect the girls did not play at recommended moderate or vigorous levels. Although the girls did not play at vigorous levels when playing XaviX J-Mat, our results showed that when playing XaviX J-Mat they did play at moderate intensity levels. No significant differences in the coefficient of variation between the three exergames were apparent. Conclusions: If active gaming is to be used to increase physical activity levels then individual differences in levels of exertion and specific activity recommendations need to be taken into consideration. © 2013 Sports Medicine Australia.",doi,10.1016/j.jsams.2013.05.008,Scopus,Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport,"Mellecker R.R., McManus A.M.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Actor Bots,"In many recent computer games there has been an increased use of Non-Player Characters as quest givers, tradesmen, members of the general public and as quest companions for the players. All these roles call for intelligent bots that can give the player an engaging experience by adjusting and adapting to the players' style of play. They need to behave as actors in a virtual improvisational theatre. They need to perform in a manner that the player finds believable and engaging so that the player becomes sufficiently immersed in the interactive drama and keeps coming back for more. The bot's intelligence needs to be both robust to respond to player actions and sufficiently complex to handle character traits, emotions and complex decision making that resembles that of a human player. A balance needs to be maintained between the bots' believability and their entertainment value for the player, as these two goals may be at odds in some situations. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

,"Aerobic Fitness, Psychological Characteristics, And Cardiovascular Reactivity To Stress.","Examined the relations among aerobic fitness (AF), psychological characteristics, and cardiovascular reactivity using 62 men divided into highly fit and less fit groups based on a maximal treadmill exercise test. Several psychological and physiological variables were measured, and subjects' cardiovascular reactivity was assessed during a mental arithmetic task and during a video game task. Highly fit subjects showed a significantly smaller increase in both diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR) and reported themselves to be less anxious and less angry than less fit subjects. Furthermore, controlling for subjects' scores on a scale assessing angry temperament reduced the relationship between AF and DBP reactivity to nonsignificant levels. These results suggest that degree of dispositional anger, which covaries with increased fitness, may contribute to the apparent relationship between AF and DBP--but not HR--reactivity.",doi,10.1037//0278-6133.9.6.676,Scopus,Health Psychology,"Czajkowski S.M., Hindelang R.D., Dembroski T.M., Mayerson S.E., Parks E.B., Holland J.C.",1990,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Aerobic Work Capacity In Elite Wheelchair Athletes: A Cross-Sectional Analysis,"Objective: To give a descriptive analysis of aerobic capacity among elite wheelchair athletes in association with various personal characteristics and sprint or anaerobic capacity. Design: Sixty-eight wheelchair athletes who participated in the World Games and Championships for the Disabled were included. Parameters for aerobic capacity were evaluated in a standardized wheelchair exercise test on a computer-controlled wheelchair ergometer at the games. The ergometer setting was individually tuned according to standardized procedures. Results: Mean maximum power output was 72.2 ± 36.7 W. Peak oxygen uptake showed similar strong variations among different subject groups. High values were seen in a group of six subjects with amputations. Results stressed that, apart from sex, functionality and training status had a strong influence on aerobic capacity. Anaerobic and aerobic capacity were strongly associated. Conclusions: Functionality, training status, and sex are important determinants of aerobic capacity. The functional classification used at international sports events is represented in the data, and further study into the possible contribution of standardized exercise tests within the issue of classification must be considered. The use of standardized exercise tests for the evaluation of training and for rehabilitation progress must be advocated, with power output being an important outcome measure at the level of ability, whereas oxygen uptake represents outcome at the level of organ systems.",doi,10.1097/00002060-200204000-00004,Scopus,American Journal of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation,"Van der Woude L.H.V., Bouten C., Veeger H.E.J., Gwinn T.",2002,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Affective State And Decision-Making In The Ultimatum Game,"The emerging field of neuroeconomics has provided evidence that emotional as well as cognitive processes may contribute to economic decision-making. Indeed, activation of the anterior insula, a brain area involved in emotional processing, has been shown to predict decision-making in the Ultimatum Game. However, as the insula has also been implicated in other brain functions, converging evidence on the role of emotion in the Ultimatum Game is needed. In the present study, 30 healthy undergraduate students played the Ultimatum Game while their skin conductance responses were measured as an autonomic index of affective state. The results revealed that skin conductance activity was higher for unfair offers and was associated with the rejection of unfair offers in the Ultimatum Game. Interestingly, this pattern was only observed for offers proposed by human conspecifics, but not for offers generated by computers. This provides direct support for economic models that acknowledge the role of emotional brain systems in everyday decision-making. © Springer-Verlag 2006.",doi,10.1007/s00221-006-0346-5,Scopus,Experimental Brain Research,"Van't Wout M., Kahn R.S., Sanfey A.G., Aleman A.",2006,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Age Differences In Responses To Progressive Social Exclusion: The Role Of Cognition And Socioemotional Functioning,"Objectives.In prior research, older adults were found to be less responsive to social slights than younger adults, but the mechanisms behind such effects have remained unclear. The present study examined age differences in susceptibility to the deleterious effects of social exclusion and investigated the explanatory role of cognitive and socioemotional variables.Method.Forty younger adults (aged 22-39) and 40 older adults (aged 58-89) played a modified version of ""Cyberball,"" a virtual ball-tossing game, in which they were initially included by 2 other players and progressively excluded in subsequent rounds. After each round, participants reported their emotions and needs satisfaction.Results.Older adults were less likely than younger adults to respond to mild levels of social exclusion, but both age groups responded similarly to more pronounced exclusion. Within the older group, participants with lower cognitive functioning were less responsive to mild exclusion, but this effect did not reach significance in the younger group.Discussion.Future research on age differences in responses to social exclusion should further explore the role of cognition and examine possible implications for interpersonal functioning. © 2012 The Author.

,Alexithymia And Empathy Predict Changes In Autonomic Arousal During Affective Stimulation,"BACKGROUND:: Alexithymia, the inability to describe one's own emotions, is linked to deficits in empathy, manifesting as a diminished capacity to recognize or understand the emotions and mental states of others. Several brain centers of autonomic control and interoception that are activated in empathy are thought to misfunction in alexithymia. We hypothesized that individual differences in autonomic changes under affective stimulation might be associated with differences in alexithymia and empathy. METHODS:: We studied 21 healthy volunteers, comparing their alexithymia and empathy scores with changes in their sympathetic autonomic arousal, indexed by the palmar skin potential level, during 3 tasks: playing a computer game, performing mental arithmetic, and watching a negative emotional valence video. RESULTS:: Both autonomic and subjective sense of arousal increased at the beginning of each task and then gradually subsided over the course of the task. Higher autonomic arousal at the onset of the computer game was associated with higher empathy scores, and at the onset of the negative video with higher scores for both empathy and alexithymia. Alexithymia delayed the habituation of autonomic arousal during the computer game, while the empathy score was related to a faster decline in arousal during the negative video task. CONCLUSIONS:: High alexithymia and high empathy scores were linked to increased autonomic arousal at the onset of emotional stimulation, but were distinguishable in the rates of habituation of the evoked arousal. Our data provide insight into the relationships among interacting psychological traits, physiologic regulation, and the arousal dimension of emotional experience. © 2013 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",doi,10.1097/WNN.0000000000000002,Scopus,Cognitive and Behavioral Neurology,"Bogdanov V.B., Bogdanova O.V., Gorlov D.S., Gorgo Y.P., Dirckx J.J.J., Makarchuk M.Y., Schoenen J., Critchley H.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Altered Reward Processing In Pathological Computer Gamers - Erp-Results From A Semi-Natural Gaming-Design,"Introduction: Internet Gaming Disorder has been added as a research diagnosis in section III for the DSM-V. Previous findings from neuroscientific research indicate an enhanced motivational attention toward cues related to computer games, similar to findings in substance-related addictions. On the other hand in clinical observational studies tolerance effects are reported by patients with Internet Gaming disorder. In the present study we investigated whether an enhanced motivational attention or tolerance effects are present in patients with Internet Gaming Disorder. Methods: A clinical sample from the Outpatient Clinic for Behavioral Addictions in Mainz, Germany was recruited, fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for Internet Gaming Disorder. In a semi-natural EEG design participants played a computer game during the recording of event-related potentials to assess reward processing. Results: The results indicated an attenuated P300 for patients with Internet Gaming Disorder in response to rewards in comparison to healthy controls, while the latency of N100 was prolonged and the amplitude of N100 was increased. Conclusions: Our findings support the hypothesis that tolerance effects are present in patients with Internet Gaming Disorder, when actively playing computer games. In addition, the initial orienting toward the gaming reward is suggested to consume more capacity for patients with Internet Gaming Disorder, which has been similarly reported by other studies with other methodological background in disorders of substance-related addictions. © 2014 The Authors.

,Altered Visual Perception In Game Transfer Phenomena: An Empirical Self-Report Study,"The aim of this study was to identify, classify, and explain gamers' perceptual experiences referred to as Visual Game Transfer Phenomena (VGTP) to contribute to the understanding of the effects of post-video-game playing and encourage healthy and safe gaming. A total of 656 experiences from 483 gamers were collected from 54 online gaming forums. The findings suggest that intensive playing can result in misperceptions and visual distortions of real-life objects and environments, stereotypical visual experiences that arise from mind visualization, and pseudo-hallucinatory experiences with video game content. Gamers' experiences can be explained by the interplay of physiological, perceptual, and cognitive mechanisms. Observation of video game features suggests that in most cases a relationship between the games' structural characteristics, gamers' VGTP experiences, and gamers' playing habits appeared relevant. VGTP can occur while gaming, immediately after stopping play, or after some delay. Further VGTP characteristics and their psychosocial implications are discussed. © 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",doi,10.1080/10447318.2013.839900,Scopus,International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction,"Ortiz de Gortari A.B., Griffiths M.D.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Alternating Task Modules In Isochronal Distributed Training Of Complex Tasks,"We compared an alternating task modules (ATM) protocol-which alternated sessions on Space Fortress, Phoenix (video-game like tasks), and algebra word problems-with a massed protocol, which blocked sessions on the tasks. The protocols were isochronal (equal in duration), each entailing one week of training and testing. ATM gave the men and women an advantage in learning and retention on Space Fortress and algebra word problems; it did not change their performance on Phoenix. Arousal, not confidence or motivation, was implicated in the ATM advantage. The practical implication of demonstrating and describing ATM benefits is that real-world training often requires minimal durations. This pragmatic constraint favors ATM over frequently investigated anisochronal schedules, in which spacing practice over long durations is more effective than massing practice in short durations. Evaluations of retention, arousal, motivation, and confidence began the process of testing theories that might be expanded to explain and enhance ATM benefits.We compared an alternating task modules (ATM) protocol - which alternated sessions on Space Fortress, Phoenix (video-game-like tasks), and algebra word problems - with a massed protocol, which blocked sessions on the tasks.

,An Emotional Student Model For Game-Play Adaptation,"Game-based learning offers key advantages for learning through experience in conjunction with offering multi-sensorial and engaging communication. However, ensuring that learning has taken place is the ultimate challenge. Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) have been incorporated into game-based learning environments to guide learners' exploration. Emotions have proven to be deeply intertwined with cognitive and motivational factors. ITSs attempt to recognise and convey emotion in order to enhance students' learning and engagement. The ITS student model is responsible for attainment of adaptability and understanding of learners' needs. It is not clear which emotions are relevant to the teaching-learning experience, or what antecedents and interpersonal differences are involved in determining an emotion. Therefore, student modelling involves uncertainty. Creating an emotional student model that can reason about students' observable behaviour during online game-play is the main goal of our research. The analysis, design and implementation for this model are our central focus here. The model uses as a basis the Control-Value theory of achievement emotions and employs motivational and cognitive variables to determine an emotion. A Probabilistic Relational Model (PRM) approach was applied to facilitate the derivation of three Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) corresponding to three types of achievement emotions. Results from a prototyping exercise conducted along with the outcome-prospective emotions DBN are presented and discussed. In future work a larger population of students will be employed to develop an accurate DBN model to incorporate into PlayPhysics, an emotional game-based learning environment for teaching Physics. © 2010 International Federation for Information Processing.",doi,10.1016/j.entcom.2010.12.006,Scopus,Entertainment Computing,"Muñoz K., Kevitt P.M., Lunney T., Noguez J., Neri L.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,An Evolutionary Agent-Based Framework For Modeling And Analysis Of Labor Market,"This paper presents an agent-based model of labor market to investigate the relationship between company and worker. Contrary to most of previous studies of labor market we apply a game theoretic approach to defining entities in labor market: companies and workers. A company can choose the level of wages, and workers can select the level of effort to increase the productivity in response to the wages. Company and worker agents are designed to possess the basic attributes in order to reflect the real labor market and their activities are adaptively changed using evolutionary model. Our approach is illustrated with four simulation results: the effect of workers resignation, sick leave, dismissal of companies, and productivity growth. Various experiments were conducted to analyze the interactions between worker and company, indicating that performance-based reward strategy and non-greedy strategy in job changing are necessary for companies and workers. The experimental results confirm that the balanced power between worker and company is important in maintenance and extension of labor market, and Nash equilibrium can be maintained in all the cases. © 2017",doi,10.1016/j.neucom.2017.01.111,Scopus,Neurocomputing,"Yu J.-M., Cho S.-B.",2018,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,An Examination Of Psychoticism And Motion Capture Controls As Moderators Of The Effects Of Violent Video Games.,"The current study examined the potential moderating effects of motion capture technology and participants’ own level of psychoticism on their hostility and aggressive thoughts after playing violent video games. A total of 118 participants (68 females, 50 males) first completed a measure of psychoticism and then played either a violent video game or a non-violent video game using either a traditional controller or motion capture controls. Immediately after the video game play period, participants’ current level of hostility and aggressive cognitions were assessed using self-report questionnaires. Results indicated that the use of motion capture controls did not increase the negative effects of violent video games. However, participants with elevated levels of psychoticism were much more affected by violent video games than other participants. Such findings suggest that only some individuals are adversely affected by violent video games and that those who are affected have preexisting dispositions which make them susceptible to such violent media.",doi,10.1016/j.chb.2008.10.001,anderson2010,Computers in Human Behavior,"Markey, P.

,An Interactive Videogame Designed To Improve Respiratory Navigator Efficiency In Children Undergoing Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance,"Background: Advanced cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) acquisitions often require long scan durations that necessitate respiratory navigator gating. The tradeoff of navigator gating is reduced scan efficiency, particularly when the patient's breathing patterns are inconsistent, as is commonly seen in children. We hypothesized that engaging pediatric participants with a navigator-controlled videogame to help control breathing patterns would improve navigator efficiency and maintain image quality. Methods: We developed custom software that processed the Siemens respiratory navigator image in real-time during CMR and represented diaphragm position using a cartoon avatar, which was projected to the participant in the scanner as visual feedback. The game incentivized children to breathe such that the avatar was positioned within the navigator acceptance window (±3 mm) throughout image acquisition. Using a 3T Siemens Tim Trio, 50 children (Age: 14 ± 3 years, 48 % female) with no significant past medical history underwent a respiratory navigator-gated 2D spiral cine displacement encoding with stimulated echoes (DENSE) CMR acquisition first with no feedback (NF) and then with the feedback game (FG). Thirty of the 50 children were randomized to undergo extensive off-scanner training with the FG using a MRI simulator, or no off-scanner training. Navigator efficiency, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and global left-ventricular strains were determined for each participant and compared. Results: Using the FG improved average navigator efficiency from 33 ± 15 to 58 ± 13 % (p < 0.001) and improved SNR by 5 % (p = 0.01) compared to acquisitions with NF. There was no difference in navigator efficiency (p = 0.90) or SNR (p = 0.77) between untrained and trained participants for FG acquisitions. Circumferential and radial strains derived from FG acquisitions were slightly reduced compared to NF acquisitions (-16 ± 2 % vs -17 ± 2 %, p < 0.001; 40 ± 10 % vs 44 ± 11 %, p = 0.005, respectively). There were no differences in longitudinal strain (p = 0.38). Conclusions: Use of a respiratory navigator feedback game during navigator-gated CMR improved navigator efficiency in children from 33 to 58 %. This improved efficiency was associated with a 5 % increase in SNR for spiral cine DENSE. Extensive off-scanner training was not required to achieve the improvement in navigator efficiency. © 2016 The Author(s).",doi,10.1186/s12968-016-0272-z,Scopus,Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance,"Hamlet S.M., Haggerty C.M., Suever J.D., Wehner G.J., Grabau J.D., Andres K.N., Vandsburger M.H., Powell D.K., Sorrell V.L., Fornwalt B.K.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia

,Ant Colony Intelligence In Multi-Agent Dynamic Manufacturing Scheduling,"This study aims at building an efficient agent-based dynamic scheduling for real-world manufacturing systems with various products, processes, and disturbances. Ant colony intelligence (ACI) is proposed to be combined with local agent coordination so as to make autonomous agents adaptive to changing circumstances and to give rise to efficient global performance. The work here differs from other dynamic scheduling research in two areas: (1) a more generic and realistic manufacturing model with multiple product types, multiple/parallel multi-purpose machines with sequence-dependent setup constraints, and various dynamic disturbances is used, (2) ACI integrated with both machine agents and job agents to solve not only the task allocation problem, but also the task sequencing problem. The implementation of the aforementioned issues in a multi-agent system (MAS) is discussed. Simulation results show that, for most of the performance measures, a MAS integrated with well-designed ant-inspired coordination performs well compared to a MAS using dispatching rules. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

,Anxiety Induction In Virtual Environments: An Experimental Comparison Of Three General Techniques,"Anxiety induction and elicitation of associated physiological arousal with virtual environments (VEs) is important in diverse domains. This paper evaluates three general anxiety induction techniques. The first augments the VE with a health bar that is often displayed in video games to indicate when the user's avatar gets hurt. The second augments the VE with aversive audio-visual stimuli, which are employed in first-person shooter games when the user's avatar gets hurt and include preset heartbeat sound. The third introduces in the previous technique a biofeedback mechanism to control heartbeat sound. The results we obtained on a VE that reproduces a fire evacuation indicate that the third technique produces much higher physiological arousal than the other two, and measures of users' state anxiety are consistent with physiological results. We discuss possible reasons that could explain why the exploitation of auditory heartbeat biofeedback contributes to make the third technique more effective, by linking our study to research and theories of affect and emotions. © The Author 2013.

,Application Of Q-Learning With Temperature Variation For Bidding Strategies In Market Based Power Systems,"The electric power industry is confronted with restructuring in which the operation scheduling is going to be decided based on a competitive market. In this new arrangement, bidding strategy has become a major issue. Participants in this deregulated energy market place may be able to compete better by choosing a suitable bidding strategy for trading electricity. Different classical methods for decision making in the uncertain environment of the market can be applied to select a suitable strategy. Most of these methods, such as game theory, that insure reaching the best solution for all market participants, require a lot of information about the other market players and the market. However, in the real market place only a little information, such as the spot price, is available for all participants. In this paper, a modified reinforcement learning based on temperature variation has been first proposed and then applied to determine the optimal strategy for a power supplier in the electricity market. A Pool-Co model has been considered here, and the simulation results are shown to be the same as those of standard game theory. Adaptation of the method in the presence of parameter variation has been verified as well. The main advantage of the proposed method is that no information about other participants is required. Furthermore, our investigation shows that even if all participants use this method, they will stay in Nash equilibrium. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

,Applications Of A Theory Of Automated Adversarial Planning To Command And Control,"One of the potentially most valuable research areas within artificial intelligence (Al), from the standpoint of military applications, involves the development of automatic planning systems. AI planners not only have the potential of autonomously solving various low-level planning problems such as those found in robotics applications, but can form the basis of expert consultation systems for higher level military planning problems including those involving command and control. An overview of a theory of automated adversarial planning is presented, which has been derived from the enhancement and expansion of AI techniques from the areas of automated planning and knowledge-based computer game playing. The adversarial planning paradigm has been successfully implemented in ARES (adversarial reasoning system), a computer program which can plan sequences of robot actions and compete in game environments, where various kinds of adversity (including intelligent adversarial counter-planners) exist.

,Are Digital Games Perceived As Fun Or Danger? Supporting And Suppressing Different Game-Related Concepts,"Violent digital game play has repeatedly been discussed to be strongly related to aggression and emotional instability. Thus, digital game players have to defend against these prejudices through emphasizing positive game-related concepts such as achievement, social interaction, and immersion. We experimentally investigated which positive- and negative-concept players and nonplayers activate when being primed with digital games. Participants were either exposed to violent or nonviolent game content and were required to work on a lexical decision task. Results showed that response latencies for the concept aggression and emotional instability were faster than for neutral concepts (not associated with digital games), but slower than for the positive concepts sociality and competition. Both players and nonplayers felt the need to defend against prejudices and emphasized positive concepts. Neither their own gaming experience nor the game content influenced the results. Being a part of the net generation is sufficient to suppress negative game-related concepts and to support positive game-related concepts to protect digital games as common leisure activity among peers. © Copyright 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2012.",doi,10.1089/cyber.2012.0171,Scopus,"Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking","Kneer J., Glock S., Beskes S., Bente G.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Are Women Better Mindreaders? Sex Differences In Neural Correlates Of Mentalizing Detected With Functional Mri,"Background: The ability to mentalize, i.e. develop a Theory of Mind (ToM), enables us to anticipate and build a model of the thoughts, emotions and intentions of others. It has long been hypothesised that women differ from men in their mentalizing abilities. In the present fMRI study we examined the impact of (1) gender (women vs. men) and (2) game partner (human vs. computer) on ToM associated neural activity in the medial prefrontal cortex. Groups of men (n = 12) and women (n = 12) interacted in an iterated classical prisoner's dilemma forced choice situation with alleged human and computer partners who were outside the scanner. Results: Both the conditions of playing against putative human as well as computer partners led to activity increases in mPFC, ACC and rTPJ, constituting the classic ToM network. However, mPFC/ACC activity was more pronounced when participants believed they were playing against the alleged human partner. Differences in the medial frontal lobe activation related to the sex of the participants could be demonstrated for the human partner > computer partner contrast. Conclusion: Our data demonstrate differences in medial prefrontal brain activation during a ToM task depending on both the gender of participants and the game partner. © 2009 Krach et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",doi,10.1186/1471-2202-10-9,Scopus,BMC Neuroscience,"Krach S., Blümel I., Marjoram D., Lataster T., Krabbendam L., Weber J., van Os J., Kircher T.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Assessing The Physiological Cost Of Active Videogames (Xbox Kinect) Versus Sedentary Videogames In Young Healthy Males,"Objectives: The aims of this study were twofold: (1) to compare the physiological costs of active videogames (AVGs) and sedentary videogames (SVGs) and (2) to compare the exercise intensities attained during AVGs with the exercise intensity criteria for moderate and vigorous physical activity, as stated in current physical activity recommendations for improving public health. Materials and Methods: Nineteen young males participated in the study (age, 23 ± 3 years; height, 178 ± 6 cm; weight, 78 ± 15 kg). Participants completed a maximum oxygen uptake (VO2 max) test and a gaming session, including AVGs (""Reflex Ridge,"" ""River Rush,"" and ""Boxing"" for the Microsoft [Redmond, WA] Kinect™) and SVGs (""FIFA 14"" [Electronic Arts, Burnaby, BC, Canada] and ""Call of Duty"" [Activision, Santa Monica, CA]). Heart rate (HR) and oxygen uptake VO2) were recorded continuously during all videogames. Rating of perceived exertion (RPE) was taken every 3 minutes during AVGs and SVGs. Energy expenditure (EE), expressed as metabolic equivalents (METs), was calculated. One MET was defined as the volume of oxygen consumed at rest in a seated position and is equal to 3.5 mL of O2/kg of body mass/minute. The exercise intensity for each game was expressed as a percentage of VO2 max and percentage of age-predicted maximum HR (HRmax). Results: Exercise intensity (percentage HRmax, percentage VO2 max, and RPE) and EE (METs) were significantly higher during active gaming compared with sedentary gameplay (P &lt; 0.01). AVGs elicited moderate levels of exercise intensity (64-72 percent HRmax) in line with current recommended physical activity guidelines. Conclusions: Our results indicate AVGs provoke physiological responses equivalent to a moderate-intensity physical activity.

,Assessment Of Fun In Interactive Systems: A Survey,"Fun is fundamental in life, since it fosters interaction and learning. But the design of fun is not trivial since it is subjective: it depends upon context, preferences and the history of users. That is why assessment is an important issue in the design process. Traditional assessment methods involve observation and inquiring of users while interacting, while more recent methods involve data collection and physiological measurements. This article presents a survey on the existing methods for the assessment of fun from its constituent elements – attention, flow, immersion and emotion. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",doi,10.1016/j.cogsys.2016.09.007,Scopus,Cognitive Systems Research,"Vieira L.C., da Silva F.S.C.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Assessment Of Learners' Motivation During Interactions With Serious Games: A Study Of Some Motivational Strategies In Food-Force,"This study investigated motivational strategies and the assessment of learners' motivation during serious gameplay. Identifying and intelligently assessing the effects that these strategies may have on learners are particularly relevant for educational computer-based systems. We proposed, therefore, the use of physiological sensors, namely, heart rate, skin conductance, and electroencephalogram (EEG), as well as a theoretical model of motivation (Keller's ARCS model) to evaluate six motivational strategies selected from a serious game called Food-Force. Results from nonparametric tests and logistic regressions supported the hypothesis that physiological patterns and their evolution are suitable tools to directly and reliably assess the effects of selected strategies on learners' motivation. They showed that specific EEG ""attention ratio"" was a significant predictor of learners' motivation and could relevantly evaluate motivational strategies, especially those associated with the Attention and Confidence categories of the ARCS model of motivation. Serious games and intelligent systems can greatly benefit from using these results to enhance and adapt their interventions. © 2012 Lotfi Derbali and Claude Frasson.",doi,10.1155/2012/624538,Scopus,Advances in Human-Computer Interaction,"Derbali L., Frasson C.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Assessment Of Student's Emotions In Game-Based Learning,"Research has shown that emotions are directly linked to cognition and there is a strong correlation between affect and learning. This notion along with recent technological advancements has prompted researchers from many disciplines to turn their attention toward adding an affective component to human-computer dialog. This chapter discusses emotion assessment methods, recent empirical research related to examining students' affective states in entertainment and educational games, and conceptual, methodological, and technological issues associated with developing emotion recognition models. An overview of emotion recognition research suggests that there is little consensus on what emotions should be measured and how to do it. Moreover, it is still not clear how emotions affect human learning and performance. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2012.",doi,10.1007/978-1-4614-3546-4_19,Scopus,"Assessment in Game-Based Learning: Foundations, Innovations, and Perspectives","Novak E., Johnson T.E.",2012,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Association Of Electroencephalogram Scalp Potential With Autonomic Nervous System,"Cerebral stimulation and autonomic nervous system have meaningful role in studies such as mental stress. This study aims to analyze changes in EEG scalp potentials which may affect autonomic stimulation of heart during rest and playing game. Ten healthy participants participated in this study and they were asked to play a video game. Electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals were measured simultaneously during and rest. Sympathetic and parasympathetic innervations of heart were estimated from heart rate variability (HRV), derived from the ECG. Scalp potential, observed in frontal and parietal region, showed a significant surge in the value theta Fz/alpha Pz (Fz(θ)/Pz(α)) (p < 0.001) while playing game. The results also showed tachycardia while playing video game as compared to rest condition (p < 0.005). Normalized low frequency power and ratio of low frequency to high frequency power were significantly increased while playing video game and normalized high frequency power sank during video games. Results showed that activation in scalp potential is synchronized with the sympathetic innervation of heart. Finally, the results showed that higher heart rate is related to lower scalp activation at Fz(θ)/Pz(α) in a similar condition. © 2013 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.

,Associative Learning For Enhancing Autonomous Bots In Videogame Design,"The Today's video games are highly technologically advanced, giving users the ability to step into virtual realities and play games from the viewpoint of highly complex characters. Most of the current efforts in the development of believable bots in videogames - bots that behave like human players - are based on classical AI techniques. Specifically, we design virtual bots using Continuous- Time Recurrent Neural Network (CTRNNs) as the controllers of the non-player characters, and we add a learning module to make an agent be capable of relearning during its lifetime. Agents controlled by CTRNNs are evolved to search for the base camp and the enemy's camp and associate them with one of two different altitudes depending on experience. We analyze the best-evolved agent's behavior and explain how it arises from the dynamics of the coupled agentenvironment system. The ultimate goal of the contest would be to develop a computer game bot able to behave the same way humans do. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2013.",doi,10.1007/978-3-319-00551-5_44,Scopus,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,"Moreno S., Bedia M.G., Serón F.J., Castillo L.F., Isaza G.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Astrojumper: Motivating Exercise With An Immersive Virtual Reality Exergame,"We present the design and evaluation of Astrojumper, an immersive virtual reality exergame developed to motivate players to engage in rigorous, full-body exercise. We performed a user study with 30 people between the ages of 6 and 50 who played the game for 15 min. Regardless of differences in age, gender, activity level, and video game experience, participants rated Astrojumper extremely positively and experienced a significant increase in heart rate after gameplay. Additionally, we found that participants' ratings of perceived workout intensity positively correlated with their level of motivation. Overall, our results demonstrate that Astrojumper effectively motivates both children and adults to exercise through immersive virtual reality technology and a simple, yet engaging, game design. © 2011 by The Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",doi,10.1162/pres_a_00036,Scopus,Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments,"Finkelstein S., Nickel A., Lipps Z., Barnes T., Wartell Z., Suma E.A.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Attention To Emotional Tone Of Voice In Speech Perception In Children With Autism,"A video game was developed to assess speech perception in 13 children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and 13 children with typical development (TYP), ages 5-17 years old. Children listened to pre-recorded sentences varying in content (e.g., ""Bob parked a van"" vs. ""Tim shut a door"") and prosody (i.e., enthusiastic vs. grouchy tone of voice). During training, children learned to select one of two sentences differing in both content and prosody (e.g., enthusiastic ""Bob parked a van"" vs. grouchy ""Tim shut a door""). At testing, children listened to test probes comprising re-combinations of the content and prosodic features of the training sentences. Testing indicated that both groups showed accurate discrimination of the training sentences from the re-combined test probes. However, whereas TYP children showed a preference to select the sentence with enthusiastic prosody over its grouchy counterpart, children with ASD did not. Thus, children with ASD show atypical attention to emotional tone of voice, even though they show no deficit in perceiving prosody. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

,Auditory Experiences In Game Transfer Phenomena: An Empirical Self-Report Study,"This study investigated gamers' auditory experiences as after effects of playing. This was done by classifying, quantifying, and analysing 192 experiences from 155 gamers collected from online videogame forums. The gamers' experiences were classified as: (i) involuntary auditory imagery (e.g., hearing the music, sounds or voices from the game), (ii) inner speech (e.g., completing phrases in the mind), (iii) auditory misperceptions (e.g., confusing real life sounds with videogame sounds), and (iv) multisensorial auditory experiences (e.g., hearing music while involuntary moving the fingers). Gamers heard auditory cues from the game in their heads, in their ears, but also coming from external sources. Occasionally, the vividness of the sound evoked thoughts and emotions that resulted in behaviours and copying strategies. The psychosocial implications of the gamers' auditory experiences are discussed. This study contributes to the understanding of the effects of auditory features in videogames, and to the phenomenology of non-volitional auditory experiences. © 2015, IGI Global.

,Automatic Recognition Of Boredom In Video Games Using Novel Biosignal Moment-Based Features,"This paper presents work conducted toward the biosignals-based automatic recognition of boredom, induced during video-game playing. For this purpose, common biosignal feature extraction methods were exploited and their capability to identify boredom was assessed. Moreover, for the first time, Legendre and Krawtchouk moments, as well as novel moment variations, were extracted as biosignal features and their potential toward automatic affect recognition was examined using the specific application scenario. The present analysis was conducted with ECG and GSR data collected from 19 different subjects, while boredom was naturally induced during the repetitive playing of a 3D video game. Conventional biosignal features as well as moment-based ones were found to be effective for the automatic recognition of boredom by achieving classification accuracies around 85 percent. Then, the joint use of moments and moment variations with conventional features was found to significantly improve classification accuracy by producing a maximum correct classification ratio of 94.17 percent. © 2011 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/T-AFFC.2011.4,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing,"Giakoumis D., Tzovaras D., Moustakas K., Hassapis G.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Bacteria Hunt: Evaluating Multi-Paradigm Bci Interaction,"The multimodal, multi-paradigm brain-computer interfacing (BCI) game Bacteria Hunt was used to evaluate two aspects of BCI interaction in a gaming context. One goal was to examine the effect of feedback on the ability of the user to manipulate his mental state of relaxation. This was done by having one condition in which the subject played the game with real feedback, and another with sham feedback. The feedback did not seem to affect the game experience (such as sense of control and tension) or the objective indicators of relaxation, alpha activity and heart rate. The results are discussed with regard to clinical neurofeedback studies. The second goal was to look into possible interactions between the two BCI paradigms used in the game: steady-state visually-evoked potentials (SSVEP) as an indicator of concentration, and alpha activity as a measure of relaxation. SSVEP stimulation activates the cortex and can thus block the alpha rhythm. Despite this effect, subjects were able to keep their alpha power up, in compliance with the instructed relaxation task. In addition to the main goals, a new SSVEP detection algorithm was developed and evaluated. © 2010 The Author(s).",doi,10.1007/s12193-010-0046-0,Scopus,Journal on Multimodal User Interfaces,"Mühl C., Gürkök H., Plass-Oude Bos D., Thurlings M.E., Scherffig L., Duvinage M., Elbakyan A.A., Kang S., Poel M., Heylen D.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Ball Positioning In Robotic Billiards: A Nonprehensile Manipulation-Based Solution,"The last two decades have seen a number of developments in creating robots to play billiards. The designed robotic systems have successfully incorporated the kinematics required and have had appropriate machine vision elements for a decent gameplay. Independently, computer scientists have also developed the artificial intelligence programs needed for the strategy to play billiards. Despite these developments, the accurate ball manipulation aspect of the game, needed for good performance, has not been addressed enough; two important parameters are the potting accuracy and advantageous cue ball positioning for next shot. In this regard, robotic ball manipulation by predicting the ball trajectories under the action of various dynamic phenomena, such as ball spin, impacts and friction, is the key consideration of this research. By establishing a connection to the methods used in nonprehensile robotic manipulation, a forward model is developed for the rolling, sliding, and two distinct types of frictional impacts of billiards balls are developed. High-speed camera-based tracking is performed to determine the physical parameters required for the developed dynamic models. To solve the inverse manipulation problem, i.e., the decision on shot parameters, for accurate ball positioning, an optimization based solution is proposed. A simplistic ball manipulator is designed and used to test the theoretical developments. Experimental results show that a 90% potting accuracy and a 100-200 mm post-shot cue ball positioning accuracy has been achieved by the autonomous system within a table area of 6 × 5 ft2. © 1996-2012 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TMECH.2015.2461547,Scopus,IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics,"Mathavan S., Jackson M.R., Parkin R.M.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Bci Promises In Emotional Involvement In Music And Games,"The reliability of commercial non-invasive BCI (brain computer Interface) devices and the lower cost of these EEG-based systems, as well as the equipment's portability, determined the increasing interest in their application in different research fields. The latter feature makes BCI devices particularly suited for entertainment applications, especially given the possibility to detect the mental state of the users. The relationship between emotions and entertainment is obvious, as is the influence ofmusic in human emotional states. While BCI devices represent a challenge in gaming motion control, they have been successfully applied in music production [Dan et al. 2009] and composition [Hamadicharef et al. 2010]. In our previous work [Conscious and unconscious music from the brain in press] we focused on conscious production of music notes with the aim of developing a prototype for applications in entertainment. In this work we trace the state-of-the art of our research and present our opinion on possible applications of the preliminary results. © 2014 ACM.",doi,10.1145/2582193.2633447,Scopus,Computers in Entertainment,"Folgieri R., Zampolini R.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Behavioral And Neural Reactions To Emotions Of Others In The Distribution Of Resources,"This study investigated the neural mechanisms involved in the interpersonal effects of emotions-i.e., how people are influenced by other people's emotions. Participants were allocators in a version of the dictator game and made a choice between two offers after receiving written emotional expressions of the recipients. The results showed that participants more often made a self-serving offer when dealing with an angry recipient than when dealing with a happy or disappointed recipient. Compared to disappointment, expressions of anger increased activation in regions associated with self-referential thinking (anterior medial prefrontal cortex, aMPFC) and (emotional) conflict (anterior cingulate cortex). We found increased activation in temporoparietal junction for receiving happy reactions in comparison with receiving angry or disappointed reactions. This study thus emphasizes that distinct emotions have distinct effects on people in terms of behavior and underlying neurological mechanisms. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",doi,10.1080/17470919.2012.735621,Scopus,Social Neuroscience,"Lelieveld G.-J., van Dijk E., Güroǧlu B., van Beest I., van Kleef G.A., Rombouts S.A.R.B., Crone E.A.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia

Estudio Sociológico De Las Tipologías Sobre Los Dominios De Ia Familia Y Del Ocio En Holanda],"The family in the Netherlands is once again on the political agenda. Newspapers and television announce discussions between politicians and policymakers. Scientists however, free from the political tide, are researching families in an attempt to discover the true developments. In this paper, an account is given of research into the family, upbringing and leisure. The study was carried out for the third time in the south of the Netherlands, in the towns of Arkel and Kedichem. In 1960, the research involved the modem Western family, while in 1972 the plastic family was registered. The third study had the task of getting empirical evidence to support the new family type. The first two studies were virtually identical in set-up, whereas the third study was very different because the questions asked before proved impossible to duplicate. Moreover, the third study consisted of three main themes: general family aspects, family and upbringing, and family and leisure. The content of the paper has mainly to do with the first and third themes. Structured interviews were conducted with 331 mothers who had at least one child aged between 0 and 18. The study illustrated the existence of three family types in rural areas in the Netherlands- the modem Western (contemporary: traditional), the transitional, and the postmodem family with its subtle leaning toward the value of leisure in the family. The general family typology demonstrates that in rural areas in the Netherlands in the late eighties/early nineties, 21% of the families were characterised as modem Western (traditional), 64% as transitional, and 15% as postrnodem. Viewed from the family leisure typology angle, these percentages show up as 54%, 34% and 12%: the family leisure typology scores are more conservative than those of the general family typology. The themes under the general family sociological denominator deal with opinions on: sex-specific task division, say in the family; independence in the marriage relation; the institution of marriage; and motherhood. Under the theme family and leisure what was sought were opinions about: task division in leisure time, definition of leisure time, togetherness in leisure time, freedom given to the partner, gender-specific upbringing during leisure time, the importance of television and games, and autonomy of the children in their free time. The results of the study have been examined against the background of individualization. The discussions relate to beliefs such as ""moral responsibility""'(Bauman, 1993), ""pure relationship"" (Giddens, 1991), ""the morphogenetic family versus the morphostatic family"" (Scanzoni, 1983) and ""the associative versus the hyperindividualistic family"" (Te Kloeze, 1989; 1996). © Presses de l'Université du Québec.",doi,10.1080/07053436.1999.10715581,Scopus,Loisir et Societe,"Te Kloeze J.W., Hoog K.",1999,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,"Beyond The Lab: Investigating Early Adolescents' Cognitive, Emotional, And Arousal Responses To Violent Games","Cognitive, emotional, and arousal responses to violent games play a central role in theoretical explanations of how violent media may affect aggression. However, existing research has focused on a relatively narrow range of responses to violent games in experimental settings. This limits our understanding of whether and how violent game-induced responses relate to aggression in real life. To address these gaps, this study investigated how cognitive effort, emotional valence, and arousal in response to violent games relate to early adolescents' aggression, both cross-sectionally and over a period of one year. In addition, we investigated how a social context variable (i.e., family conflict) predicts these responses to violent games and subsequent aggression. A sample of 448 early adolescents (10-14 years) completed survey questions and media diaries that measured their responses to violent games. Results showed that, outside the lab, a positive cross-sectional relationship between violent game-induced arousal and aggression exists. In addition, arousal mediated the relationship between family conflict and aggression. Study findings justify increased research attention to media responses outside the lab and a need for further theoretical and methodological refinement. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

,Bidding Algorithms For Simultaneous Auctions: A Case Study,"This paper describes RoxyBot, one of the top-scoring agents in the First International Trading Agent Competition, TAC-2000. A TAC agent simulates one vision of future travel agents: it represents a set of clients in simultaneous auctions, trading complementary (e.g., airline tickets and hotel reservations) and substitutable (e.g., symphony and theater tickets) goods. RoxyBot faced two key technical challenges in TAC: (i) allocation - - assigning purchased goods to clients at the end of a game instance so as to maximize total client utility, and (ii) completion - - determining the optimal quantity of each resource to buy and sell given client preferences, current holdings, and market prices. For the dimensions of TAC, an optimal solution to the allocation problem is tractable, and RoxyBot uses a search algorithm based on A* to produce optimal allocations. An optimal solution to the completion problem is also tractable, but in the interest of minimizing bidding cycle time, RoxyBot solves the completion problem using beam search with a greedy heuristic, producing approximately optimal completions. RoxyBot's completer relies on an innovative data structure called a priceline. © 2005 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.",doi,10.1007/s10458-004-6975-9,Scopus,Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems,"Greenwald A., Boyan J.",2005,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Blood Pressure And Response To “Stress” In 11–16 Year Old Children,"ABSTRACT. Blood pressure at rest and cardiovascular response to “stress” were studied in 27 girls and 33 boys 11–16 years old. One group (HT, n = 23) had hypertensive mothers with a previous hypertensive pregnancy, another group (NT, n = 20) had normotensive mothers with a previous hypertensive pregnancy and the control group (C, n = 17) had normotensive mothers with normotensive pregnancies. Resting blood pressure was 124/71 mmHg (HT), 117/67 mmHg (NT) and 112/65 mmHg in the 3 groups. Systolic pressure was significantly different in all 3 groups (p < 0.05 ‐ p <0.001). Responses to noise stimulation (100 dBA) were identical in all groups with increases in diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure and cardiac output. During a video game session increases in blood pressure and heart rate were equal in the groups but during physical exercise a slight decrease in diastolic blood pressure was seen in the NT and C groups only. Differences in blood pressure in children with varying maternal history of hypertension do not seem to reflect alterations in the cardiovascular response pattern to “stress”. 1985 Association for the Publication of the Journal of Internal Medicine",doi,10.1111/j.0954-6820.1985.tb08776.x,Scopus,Acta Medica Scandinavica,"Svensson A., Hansson L.",1985,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Blood Pressure Reactivity To Psychological Stress In Young Adults And Cognition In Midlife: The Coronary Artery Risk Development In Young Adults (Cardia) Study,"Background-The classic view of blood pressure (BP) reactivity to psychological stress in relation to cardiovascular risks assumes that excess reactivity is worse and lower reactivity is better. Evidence addressing how stress-induced BP reactivity in young adults is associated with midlife cognitive function is sparse. Methods and Results-We assessed BP reactivity during a star tracing task and a video game in adults aged 20 to 32 years. Twenty-three years later, cognitive function was assessed with use of the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (a psychomotor speed test), the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (a verbal memory test), and the modified Stroop test (an executive function test). At the time of follow-up, participants (n=3021) had a mean age of 50.2 years; 56% were women, and 44% were black. In linear regression models adjusted for demographic and clinical characteristics including baseline and follow-up resting BP, lower systolic BP (SBP) reactivity during the star tracing and video game was associated with worse Digit Symbol Substitution Test scores (b [SE]: 0.11 [0.02] and 0.05 [0.02], respectively) and worse performance on the Stroop test (b [SE]: -0.06 [0.02] and -0.05 [0.02]; all P>0.01). SBP reactivity was more consistently associated than diastolic BP reactivity with cognitive function scores. The associations between SBP reactivity and cognitive function were mostly similar between blacks and whites. Conclusions-Lower psychological stress-induced SBP reactivity in younger adults was associated with lower cognitive function in midlife. BP reactivity to psychological stressors may have different associations with target organs in hypertension. © 2016 The Authors.",doi,10.1161/JAHA.115.002891,Scopus,Journal of the American Heart Association,"Yano Y., Ning H., Reis J.P., Lewis C.E., Launer L.J., Bryan R.N., Yaffe K., Sidney S., Albanese E., Greenland P., Lloyd-Jones D., Liu K.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,"Body Mass Index Of 16-Year Olds In Urban Maseru, Lesotho","Background: Overweight and/or obesity amongst children and adolescents is a global epidemic with health consequences that track into adulthood. No data are currently available regarding overweight/obesity amongst adolescents in Lesotho. Aim and setting: To assess the prevalence of overweight and/or obesity and the associated risk factors amongst 16-year olds in urban Maseru, Lesotho.

Diet histories and data on lifestyle, physical activity and knowledge, attitudes and/or perceptions and practices regarding nutrition were obtained during structured interviews and body mass index (BMI) was determined. Results: Amongst these 16-year olds, 27.2% girls and 8.3% boys were overweight and/or obese based on World Health Organization cut-offs for BMI; 39.8% were insufficiently active or inactive; 6.4% used alcohol regularly; and 11.7% used tobacco. Whilst 28.1% reported no television watching/ electronic gaming/computer usage (combined screen time) outside school, 23.6% reported ≥ 4 hours of combined screen time outside school. Most (91.4%) consumed < 3 servings of vegetables/ day; 86.4% consumed < 2 servings of fruits/day; and 95.5% consumed < 2 servings of dairy/day. The majority consumed maize porridge (56.1%), bread (63.8%) and margarine/oil/fat (82.3%) daily and added sugar to their food (74.2%). Fruits, vegetables, dairy, meat, pulses and traditional foods were only consumed weekly or less often. Most bought from tuck shops (18.6% daily; 54.3% weekly). Various gaps in knowledge, perceptions and practices were identified that may benefit from educational intervention. Conclusions: The current study identifies westernised dietary and lifestyle changes, along with overweight and/or obesity, amongst 16-year old adolescents in Lesotho. © 2014.

,Body Segment Kinematics And Energy Expenditure In Active Videogames,"Objective: Energy expenditure (EE) in active videogames (AVGs) is a component for assessing its benefit for cardiovascular health. Existing evidence suggests that AVGs are able to increase EE above rest and when compared with playing passive videogames. However, the association between body movement and EE remains unclear. Furthermore, for goal-directed game design, it is important to know the contribution of body segments to EE. This knowledge will help to acquire a certain level of exercise intensity during active gaming. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the best predictors of EE from body segment energies, acceleration, and heart rate during different game situations. Materials and Methods: EE and body segment movement of 17 subjects, aged 22.1 ± 2.5 years, were measured in two different AVGs. In randomized order, the subjects played a handheld-controlled Nintendo® Wii™ tennis (NWT) game and a whole body-controlled Sony EyeToy® waterfall (ETW) game. Body segment movement was analyzed using a three-dimensional motion capture system. From the video data, mean values of mechanical energy change and acceleration of 10 body segments were analyzed. Results: Measured EE was significantly higher in ETW (7.8 ± 1.4 metabolic equivalents [METs]) than in NWT (3.4 ± 1.0 METs). The best prediction parameter for the more intense ETW game was the energy change of the right thigh and for the less intense hand-controlled NWT game was the energy change of the upper torso. Segment acceleration was less accurate in predicting EE. Conclusion: The best predictors of metabolic EE were the thighs and the upper torso in whole body and handheld-controlled games, respectively. Increasing movement of these body segments would lead to higher physical activity intensity during gaming, reducing sedentary behavior. © Copyright 2016, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016.",doi,10.1089/g4h.2015.0058,Scopus,Games for Health Journal,"Böhm B., Hartmann M., Böhm H.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Brain Activity During The Flow Experience: A Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy Study,"Flow is the holistic experience felt when an individual acts with total involvement. Although flow is likely associated with many functions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), such as attention, emotion, and reward processing, no study has directly investigated the activity of the PFC during flow. The objective of this study was to examine activity in the PFC during the flow state using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Twenty right-handed university students performed a video game task under conditions designed to induce psychological states of flow and boredom. During each task and when completing the flow state scale for occupational tasks, change in oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy-Hb) concentration in frontal brain regions was measured using fNIRS. During the flow condition, oxy-Hb concentration was significantly increased in the right and left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. Oxy-Hb concentration tended to decrease in the boredom condition. There was a significant increase in oxy-Hb concentration in the right and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, right and left frontal pole areas, and left ventrolateral PFC when participants were completing the flow state scale after performing the task in the flow condition. In conclusion, flow is associated with activity of the PFC, and may therefore be associated with functions such as cognition, emotion, maintenance of internal goals, and reward processing. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.neulet.2014.05.011,Scopus,Neuroscience Letters,"Yoshida K., Sawamura D., Inagaki Y., Ogawa K., Ikoma K., Sakai S.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Caffeine Administration Does Not Alter Salivary -Amylase Activity In Young Male Daily Caffeine Consumers,"Background: To follow up on a recent report from our lab [Hum Psychopharmacol 25:359-367, 2010.] we examined the effects of caffeine on salivary -amylase (sAA) activity in response to an engaging, non-stressful task in healthy young males (age 18-30 yrs) who consumed caffeine on a daily basis. Using a placebo-controlled, double-blind, between-subjects design, 45 men received either placebo, 200 mg or 400 mg of caffeine (Vivarin®). Participants then rested for 20 minutes, and performed a 20-minute computerized air traffic controller-like task that was cognitively engaging but not stressful. Saliva samples (assayed for sAA and cortisol), blood pressure, and heart rate were taken before (baseline) and 15 minutes after the computerized task. Results: Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and sAA activity increased across the laboratory session (F's > 9.20, p's < 0.05); salivary cortisol levels decreased (F = 16.17, p < 0.05). There were no main effects for caffeine administration on sAA, salivary cortisol, or cardiovascular measures, and caffeine did not interact with the task to alter these measures. Conclusions: Laboratory administered caffeine does not alter sAA activity, even when sAA activity is stimulated by participating in a cognitively engaging task. These data demonstrate that caffeine administration does not affect sAA activity, at least in healthy young men who regularly consume caffeine. Results support recent findings that basal caffeine levels in habitual caffeine users are not associated with basal sAA activity and that daily caffeine intake and diurnal sAA activity are not related. © 2014 Klein et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",doi,10.1186/1756-0500-7-30,Scopus,BMC Research Notes,"Klein L.C., Whetzel C.A., Bennett J.M., Ritter F.E., Nater U.M., Schoelles M.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Cardiac Patients Show High Interest In Technology Enabled Cardiovascular Rehabilitation,"Background: Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) can slow or reverse the progression of cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, uptake of community-based CR is very low. E-cardiology, e-health and technology solutions for physical activity uptake and monitoring have evolved rapidly and have potential in CVD management. However, it is unclear what the current technology usage is of CVD patients, and their needs and interests for technology enabled CR. Methods: A technology usage questionnaire was developed and completed by patients from a supervised ambulatory CR program and an adult congenital heart disease clinic and from two community-based CR programs. Results were described and related with age, gender and educational level by Spearman correlations. Results: Of 310 patients, 298 patients (77 % male; mean age 61,7 ± 14,5 years) completed at least 25 questions of the survey and were included in the analysis (completion rate 96 %). Most (97 %) patients had a mobile phone and used the internet (91 %). Heart rate monitors were used by 35 % and 68 % reported to find heart rate monitoring important when exercising at home. Physical activity monitoring was reported by 12 % of the respondents. Respondents were interested in CR support through internet (77 %) and mobile phone (68 %). Many patients reported interest in game-based CR (67 %) and virtual rehabilitation (58 %). At least medium interest in technology enabled CR was reported by 75 % of the patients. Interest decreased with increasing age (r = -0.16; p = 0.005). Conclusions: CVD patients show interest for technology enabled home-based CR. Our results could guide the design of a technology-based, virtual CR intervention. © 2016 The Author(s).",doi,10.1186/s12911-016-0329-9,Scopus,BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making,"Buys R., Claes J., Walsh D., Cornelis N., Moran K., Budts W., Woods C., Cornelissen V.A.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Cardiovascular (Cv) Responsivity And Recovery To Acute Stress And Future Cv Functioning In Youth With Family Histories Of Cv Disease: A 4-Year Longitudinal Study,"Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) data obtained during supine rest, in response to and recovery from four laboratory stressors in a baseline year were used to predict supine resting BP and HR values obtained during each of four consecutive annual follow-up evaluations. Subjects were 385 normotensive youth [95 African American (AA) males, 106 AA females, 92 European American (EA) males, 92 EA females] (mean age 12.7±2.6 at baseline year) with a positive family history of cardiovascular disease (CVD). During the baseline evaluation subjects were presented with four laboratory stressors (namely, postural change, video game challenge, social competence interview, and parent-child conflict discussion). The BP and HR values taken during each of the laboratory stressors and during the post stressor recovery periods were converted to z-scores which were averaged to yield aggregate measures for systolic and diastolic BP and HR responsivity and recovery. The data obtained during the baseline evaluation were subsequently used to predict the follow-up values of supine resting BP and HR. The prediction models were fairly consistent across each of the 4 follow-up years. Responsivity or recovery accounted for up to 6% of the total variance after accounting for baseline values. Within the prediction models responsivity or recovery accounted for 4-56% of the variance. The predictive value of the derived models did not decline from one annual evaluation to the next over the length of the study.

,Cardiovascular Changes During Social Competition In A Mixed-Motive Game,"16 male and 16 female undergraduates played a mixed-motive game against a male confederate under either a 20 or an 80% cooperative strategy while cardiovascular responses were computer monitored. Females had larger heart rate responses than males during play under the competitive strategy, and the opposite was true during play under the cooperative strategy. Ss who were more competitive during the game, who scored higher on a coronary-prone (Type A) behavior scale, or who reported having an action orientation toward life stress tended to have larger heart rate responses during the game than did the remaining Ss. Results draw attention to the importance of covert autonomic responses for understanding overt behavioral choices in mixed-motive games and to the potential utility of this behavioral model for studying the role of psychosocial factors in psychosomatic illnesses.

,Cardiovascular Reactivity To Psychological Stress In Healthy Children,"Cardiovascular reactivity to stress has been implicated as a marker and/or mechanism in the development of cardiovascular disease. No normative data exist to classify children's reactivity to psychological stress. This investigation presents normative percentile data on the hemodynamic responses (heart rate and blood pressure) of 310 healthy, black or white, children between the ages of 6 and 18 years to the stress of a television video game. A series of three video games, played under three increasing levels of stress, elicited progressively higher values of blood pressure and heart rate. Both the child's race and gender, as well as the experimenter's race, significantly affected reactivity. Children demonstrated a wide range of interchild reactivity, thus allowing separation of individuals into high and low risk percentile groups. Copyright © 1988, Wiley Blackwell.

,Cardiovascular Response Of Trained Preadolescent Boys To Mental Challenge,"Purpose: To compare the cardiovascular reactivity response to mental challenge of aerobically trained and untrained preadolescent boys. Methods: Heart rate (HR) and blood pressure, as well as stroke volume, total peripheral resistance, rate pressure product, and cardiac contractility response in 15 aerobically trained (10.3 yr) and 15 untrained (9.5 yr) subjects during and recovering from the Stroop task and a computer game (Tetris) were examined. Cardiac vagal activity was also assessed using time series analysis of heart period variability (HPVts). Results: Untrained compared with trained subjects made significantly more errors during Stroop, whereas performance on Tetris was similar. Trained subjects had significantly lower (P &lt; 0.05) HR and significantly greater cardiac vagal activity at rest. Both groups had significant increases in HR, peripheral resistance, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, rate pressure product, and a significant decrease in vagal activity during Stroop. In contrast, only diastolic blood pressure increased and vagal activity decreased during Tetris. Cardiac contractility of both groups failed to increase during either stressor. Trained compared with untrained subjects had significantly lower absolute HR during and recovering from Stroop. Also HR and vagal activity change, relative to baseline, was significantly greater for the trained during Stroop. During and recovering from Tetris, absolute HR was significantly less for the trained subjects, but change scores were not significantly different. Conclusions: The greater HR and vagal activity change of trained subjects to the Stroop suggests greater cardiac reactivity to mental challenge.",doi,10.1249/01.MSS.0000078935.78895.8E,Scopus,Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise,"Franks P.W., Boutcher S.H.",2003,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Cardiovascular Responses In Type A And Type B Men To A Series Of Stressors,"Fifty-six healthy adult males were administered the Type A Structured Interview and assessed as exhibiting either Type A (N=42) or Type B (N=14) behavior pattern. They were monitored for systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR) responses during a series of six challenging tasks: Mental Arithmetic, Hypothesis Testing, Reaction Time, Video Game, Handgrip, and Cold Pressor. The results indicated that Type A subjects exhibited greater cardiovascular responses than did Type B subjects during some (Hypothesis Testing, Reaction Time, Video Game and Mental Arithmetic) but not all (Handgrip and Cold Pressor) of the tasks.

,Causal Effects Of Violent Sports Video Games On Aggression: Is It Competitiveness Or Violent Content?,"Three experiments examined the impact of excessive violence in sport video games on aggression-related variables. Participants played either a nonviolent simulation-based sports video game (baseball or football) or a matched excessively violent sports video game. Participants then completed measures assessing aggressive cognitions (Experiment 1), aggressive affect and attitudes towards violence in sports (Experiment 2), or aggressive behavior (Experiment 3). Playing an excessively violent sports video game increased aggressive affect, aggressive cognition, aggressive behavior, and attitudes towards violence in sports. Because all games were competitive, these findings indicate that violent content uniquely leads to increases in several aggression-related variables, as predicted by the General Aggression Model and related social–cognitive models.",doi,10.1016/j.jesp.2009.04.019,anderson2010,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,"Anderson, C.

,"Characterizing Diabetes, Diet, Exercise, And Obesity Comments On Twitter","Social media provide a platform for users to express their opinions and share information. Understanding public health opinions on social media, such as Twitter, offers a unique approach to characterizing common health issues such as diabetes, diet, exercise, and obesity (DDEO); however, collecting and analyzing a large scale conversational public health data set is a challenging research task. The goal of this research is to analyze the characteristics of the general public's opinions in regard to diabetes, diet, exercise and obesity (DDEO) as expressed on Twitter. A multi-component semantic and linguistic framework was developed to collect Twitter data, discover topics of interest about DDEO, and analyze the topics. From the extracted 4.5 million tweets, 8% of tweets discussed diabetes, 23.7% diet, 16.6% exercise, and 51.7% obesity. The strongest correlation among the topics was determined between exercise and obesity (p <.0002). Other notable correlations were: diabetes and obesity (p <.0005), and diet and obesity (p <.001). DDEO terms were also identified as subtopics of each of the DDEO topics. The frequent subtopics discussed along with “Diabetes”, excluding the DDEO terms themselves, were blood pressure, heart attack, yoga, and Alzheimer. The non-DDEO subtopics for “Diet” included vegetarian, pregnancy, celebrities, weight loss, religious, and mental health, while subtopics for “Exercise” included computer games, brain, fitness, and daily plan. Non-DDEO subtopics for “Obesity” included Alzheimer, cancer, and children. With 2.67 billion social media users in 2016, publicly available data such as Twitter posts can be utilized to support clinical providers, public health experts, and social scientists in better understanding common public opinions in regard to diabetes, diet, exercise, and obesity. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",doi,10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2017.08.002,Scopus,International Journal of Information Management,"Karami A., Dahl A.A., Turner-McGrievy G., Kharrazi H., Shaw G., Jr.",2018,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Charlie: An Adaptive Robot Design With Hand And Face Tracking For Use In Autism Therapy,"Basic turn-taking and imitation skills are imperative for effective communication and social interaction (Nehaniv in Imitation and Social Learning in Robots, Springer, New York, 2007). Recently, research has demonstrated that interactive games using turn-taking and imitation have yielded positive results with autistic children who have impaired communication or social skills (Barakova and Brok in Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Entertainment Computing, pp. 115-126, 2010). This paper describes a robot that plays interactive imitation games using hand and face tracking. The robot is equipped with a head and two arms, each with two degrees of freedom, and a camera. We trained a human hands detector and subsequently, used this detector along with a standard face tracker to create two autonomous interactive games: single-player (""Imitate Me, Imitate You"") and two-player (""Pass the Pose"".) Additionally, we implemented a third setting in which the robot is teleoperated by remote control. In ""Imitate Me, Imitate You"", the robot has both passive and active game modes. In the passive mode, the robot waits for the child to initiate an interaction by raising one or both hands. In the second game mode, the robot initiates interactions. The ""Pass the Pose"" game engages two children in cooperative play by enlisting the robot as a mediator between two children alternately initiating and imitating poses. These games are designed to increase attention, promote turn-taking skills and encourage child-led verbal and nonverbal communication through simple imitative play. This research makes two specific contributions: (1) We present a low-cost robot design which measures and adapts to a child's actions during interactive games and, (2) we train, test and make freely available, a new hand detector, based on Haar-like features, which is usable in various kinds of human-robot interactions. We present proof-of-concept experiments with a group of typically developing children. © Springer Science & Business Media BV 2011.",doi,10.1007/s12369-011-0110-2,Scopus,International Journal of Social Robotics,"Boccanfuso L., O'Kane J.M.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,"Children's Emotional Experience Of Peer Provocation: The Relation Between Observed Behaviour And Self-Reports Of Emotions, Expressions, And Social Goals","For an experimental study of children's responses to peer provocation, this investigation examined the correlations between children's observed behaviours and their self-reports of their emotional experiences, expressions, and social goals provided in an interview immediately following the provocation. Participants were 565 children (approximate ages 8, 10, and 12 years old) who were provoked in two ways in an experimental play session: By losing at a computer game they were playing for a desirable prize, and by being taunted by a peer actor. Children's responses to provocation were reliably coded for verbalisations, facial expressions, and gestures. Results indicated often significant but quite modest correlations between children's self-reports of their emotional behaviour and their behaviours as coded during the play session. For the magnitude of these correlations, there were not significant developmental differences, and the strength of the correlations did not differ for same-or for other-gender dyads. There was some evidence that for girls, self-reports corresponded to emotional behaviours more strongly than for boys.",doi,10.1080/01650250143000085,Scopus,International Journal of Behavioral Development,"Underwood M.K., Bjornstad G.J.",2001,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,"Children’s And Adults' Salivary Cortisol Responses To An Identical Psychosocial Laboratory Stressor. Psychoneuroendocrinology, 35(2), 241–8.","Many studies have investigated hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis responses to psychosocial stress in adults. In children, much less is known about HPA axis reactivity, and a sizable number of studies has not detected a significant cortisol response. Moreover, there is a lack of studies comparing adults' and children's responses to identical stressors. The aim of the present study was to modify an existing laboratory stressor to serve as a potent stressor in children and to allow for direct comparison between children's and adults' stress responses. Thirty children, ages 9-12 (14 female), and 31 young adults, ages 18-25 (17 female), were exposed to the modified protocol (TSST-M). A significant increase in salivary cortisol was observed in response to the TSST-M, F(2.5,125.4)=19.65, p<.001, eta(2)=.28, and overall, no differences were found between children's and adults' responses, F(2.5,125.4)=.31, n.s. Children and adults also showed similar changes in negative and positive affect, both F<1.18, n.s. and reported a similar amount of distress during the TSST-M, F(1,57)=.97, n.s. Children did, however, exhibit a significantly greater number of behaviors indicative of distress, F(1,50)=6.59, p=.01, eta(2)=.12. This study provides preliminary evidence that the TSST-M is a useful laboratory procedure to induce significant cortisol responses in children.

,"Chronotype, Sleep Loss, And Diurnal Pattern Of Salivary Cortisol In A Simulated Daylong Driving","The study focused on chronotype-related differences in subjective load assessment, sleepiness, and salivary cortisol pattern in subjects performing daylong simulated driving. Individual differences in work stress appraisal and psychobiological cost of prolonged load seem to be of importance in view of expanding compressed working time schedules. Twenty-one healthy, male volunteers (mean±SD: 27.9±4.9 yrs) were required to stay in semiconstant routine conditions. They performed four sessions (each lasting ∼2.5h) of simulated driving, i.e., completed chosen tasks from computer driving games. Saliva samples were collected after each driving session, i.e., at 10:0011:00, 14:0015:00, 18:0019:00, and 22:0023:00h as well as 1030min after waking (between 05:00 and 06:00h) and at bedtime (after 00:00h). Two subgroups of subjects were distinguished on the basis of the Chronotype Questionnaire: morning (M)- and evening (E)-oriented types. Subjective data on sleep need, sleeping time preferences, sleeping problems, and the details of the preceding night were investigated by questionnaire. Subjective measures of task load (NASA Task Load Index [NASA-TLX]), activation (Thayer's Activation-Deactivation Adjective Check List [AD ACL]), and sleepiness (Karolinska Sleepiness Scale [KSS]) were applied at times of saliva samples collection. M- and E-oriented types differed significantly as to their ideal sleep length (6 h 54 min±44 versus 8 h 13 min±50 min), preferred sleep timing (midpoint at 03:19 versus 04:26), and sleep index, i.e., 'real-to-ideal' sleep ratio, before the experimental day (0.88 versus 0.67). Sleep deficit proved to be integrated with eveningness. M and E types exhibited similar diurnal profiles of energy, tiredness, tension, and calmness assessed by AD ACL, but E types estimated higher their workload (NASA-TLX) and sleepiness (KSS). M types exhibited a trend of higher mean cortisol levels than E types (F4.192, p<.056) and distinct diurnal variation (F2.950, p<.019), whereas E types showed a flattened diurnal curve. Cortisol values did not correlate with subjective assessments of workload, arousal, or sleepiness at any time-of-day. Diurnal cortisol pattern parameters (i.e., morning level, mean level, and range of diurnal changes) showed significant positive correlations with sleep length before the experiment (r.48, .54, and .53, respectively) and with sleep index (r.63, .64, and .56, respectively). The conclusions of this study are: (i) E-oriented types showed lower salivary cortisol levels and a flattened diurnal curve in comparison with M types; (ii) sleep loss was associated with lower morning cortisol and mean diurnal level, whereas higher cortisol levels were observed in rested individuals. In the context of stress theory, it may be hypothesized that rested subjects perceived the driving task as a challenge, whereas those with reduced sleep were not challenged, but boredexhausted with the experimental situation. copyright © 2010 Informa UK Ltd.",doi,10.3109/07420528.2010.489412,Scopus,Chronobiology International,"Oginska H., Fafrowicz M., Golonka K., Marek T., Mojsa-Kaja J., Tucholska K.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Client-Server Games And Their Equilibria In Peer-To-Peer Networks,"In peer-to-peer networks, each peer acts simultaneously as client and server, by issuing and satisfying content requests respectively. In this work, we use concepts from non-cooperative game theory to model the interaction of autonomous peers. The client strategy set consists of feasible request load splits towards servers, while the server strategy set is formed out of possible service disciplines on received requests. The performance metric of interest is the average retrieval delay of content requests. First, we assume preassigned fixed server policies (FIFO and priority) and study the emerging client request load splitting game. Peers are either egotistic (i.e. interested only in optimizing their own delay) or altruistic ones that also take into account delay incurred to other peers. We consider best response updates to model iterative peer interaction. For egotistic peers, we show that the sequence of best responses always converges to the unique Nash Equilibrium Point (NEP). For altruistic peers best response updates converge to one of the multiple NEPs exist, with each one being a global optimum for the FIFO case and a local optimum for any other service strategy profile. We also consider mixed swarms consisting of both egotistic and (partially-) altruistic peers and show an interesting transition from one to multiple NEPs. Next, we include service strategies in the peer strategy set. Though with its service policy a peer cannot directly affect its delay, it can affect the resulting NEP. We devise two-level game models, where, at a first level, a peer selects its favorable service rule and then peers play a client load splitting game. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

,"Cognitive, Emotional, And Behavioral Determinants Involved In The Use Of Video Games: Towards A Better Understanding Of Excessive Gaming For Cbt Interventions","Summary Studies on excessive video game use rarely focus on cognitive, emotional, and behavioral experience of video game players. CBTs for pathological gambling accurately address the cognitive processes of gamblers, but the typical functionings of video game players are not widely discussed in video game addiction CBT. This study clarifies these variables through content analysis of individual interviews conducted with frequent and/or excessive video game players. These players are characterized by high weekly gaming time (WGT), numerous years of playing practice and a PVP's score (Problem Video Game Playing Questionnaire) significantly correlated to WGT. These interviews focus on five key moments of the game: ""Before"", ""During"" and ""After"" the game, and when ""Winning"" or ""Losing"". A wide range of video games is taken into account both online and offline. The results, in conjunction with the existing literature, update variables known to cognitive psychology (various but specific emotions and physical manifestations; anticipatory, relief-oriented and permissive beliefs; attentional resources; etc.) and the dynamic richness of which is demonstrated according to the five playing moments. These specific variables provide a sound basis for studies concerning excessive video games use and for gaming experiences focused CBTs. © 2014 Association française de thérapie comportementale et cognitive.

,Collaborative Sensing In A Distributed Ptz Camera Network,"The performance of dynamic scene algorithms often suffers because of the inability to effectively acquire features on the targets, particularly when they are distributed over a wide field of view. In this paper, we propose an integrated analysis and control framework for a pan, tilt, zoom (PTZ) camera network in order to maximize various scene understanding performance criteria (e.g., tracking accuracy, best shot, and image resolution) through dynamic camera-to-target assignment and efficient feature acquisition. Moreover, we consider the situation where processing is distributed across the network since it is often unrealistic to have all the image data at a central location. In such situations, the cameras, although autonomous, must collaborate among themselves because each camera's PTZ parameter entails constraints on the others. Motivated by recent work in cooperative control of sensor networks, we propose a distributed optimization strategy, which can be modeled as a game involving the cameras and targets. The cameras gain by reducing the error covariance of the tracked targets or through higher resolution feature acquisition, which, however, comes at the risk of losing the dynamic target. Through the optimization of this reward-versus-risk tradeoff, we are able to control the PTZ parameters of the cameras and assign them to targets dynamically. The tracks, upon which the control algorithm is dependent, are obtained through a consensus estimation algorithm whereby cameras can arrive at a consensus on the state of each target through a negotiation strategy. We analyze the performance of this collaborative sensing strategy in active camera networks in a simulation environment, as well as a real-life camera network. © 2012 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TIP.2012.2188806,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Image Processing,"Ding C., Song B., Morye A., Farrell J.A., Roy-Chowdhury A.K.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Combining Exergame Training With Omega-3 Fatty Acid Supplementation: Protocol For A Randomized Controlled Study Assessing The Effect On Neuronal Structure/Function In The Elderly Brain,"A common problem in the older population is the risk of falling and related injury, immobility, and reduced survival. Age-related neuronal changes, e.g., decline in gray-and white-matter, affect neuronal, cognitive, and motor functioning. The improvement of these factors might decrease fall events in elderly. Studies showed that administration of video game-based physical exercise, a so-called exergame, or omega-3 fatty acid (FA) may improve motor and/or cognitive functioning through neuronal changes in the brain of older adults. The aim of this study is to assess the effects of a combination of exergame training with omega-3 FA supplementation on the elderly brain. We hypothesize that an intervention using a combination approach differently affects on the neuronal structure and function of the elderly's brain as compared to the sole administration of exergame training. The study is a parallel, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial lasting 26 weeks. Sixty autonomous living, non-smoking, and right-handed healthy older (>65 years) adults who live independently or in a senior residency are included, randomized, and allocated to one of two study groups. The experimental group receives a daily amount of 13.5 ml fish oil (including 2.9 g of omega-3 FA), whereas the control group receives a daily amount of 13.5 ml olive oil for 26 weeks. After 16 weeks, both groups start with an exergame training program three times per week. Measurements are performed on three time-points by treatment blinded investigators: pre-intervention measurements, blood sample after 16 week, and post-intervention measurements. The main outcomes are motor evoked potentials of the right M. tibialis anterior (transcranial magnetic stimulation) and response-related potentials (electroencephalography) during a cognitive test. For secondary outcomes, reaction time during cognitive tests and spatio-temporal parameters during gait performance are measured. Statistics will include effect sizes and a 2 × 2-ANOVA with normally distributed data or the non-parametric equivalent for data not fulfilling normal distribution. The randomized controlled study is the first to investigate the effectiveness of exergame training combined with omega-3 FA in counteracting age- and behavioral-dependent neuronal changes in the brain.

,Combining Experimental Observations And Modelling In Investigating Feedback And Emotions In Repeated Selection Tasks,"People seem to learn tasks even without formal training. This can be modelled as the outcome of a feedback system that accumulates experience. In this paper we investigate such a feedback system, following an iterative research approach. A feedback loop is specified that is detailed using contemporary ideas on human behaviour. The resulting model is investigated in an empirical study. Finally, we consider a computational mechanism to explain the results. This approach is aimed at understanding how a feedback mechanism might work rather than at observing its outcomes. In this paper, we study the approach through adjustments in card selections in a game consisting of repeated card choices. Playing this game, participants do not know what rules determine gains and losses. Therefore there is some tension between exploring the options and achieving immediate profit. To decide in such situations it is argued that often evaluations below the level of conscious awareness, such as affect, play an important role. The results support the hypothesis that participants would draw better cards as the game progressed. There is some evidence that emotions are involved, since the hypothesis that profit and emotions are correlated is confirmed. Further evidence that formal logic is not sufficient follows from the observed effects of music on card selections. In the second part of the paper the aim is to understand the results from a computational point of view. Four possible ways of integrating feedback into a decision criterion are compared. Using one of these mechanisms, a computational model is investigated that might describe the role of music in card selection. Although there are limitations to both the empirical and computational findings, the chosen approach indicates that computational modelling of experiential appraisal, at a preconscious level, and the effect of external factors, such as music, is in principle feasible, and can lead to a research agenda aimed at understanding such phenomena. © Springer 2005.",doi,10.1007/s11257-005-1868-4,Scopus,User Modelling and User-Adapted Interaction,"Fischer A.R.H., Blommaert F.J.J., Midden C.J.H.",2005,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Comparison Of Three Distraction Techniques In Reducing Stress In Dental Patients.,"Three types of distraction were investigated in the dental operatory with patients receiving amalgam restorations. The distraction conditions included an audio-comedy program, a video-comedy program, and a video game. The results indicated that both the video comedy and the video game successfully distracted patients during the dental procedure. The data suggest that successful distraction is accompanied by an increase in physiologic arousal. This finding contrasts with earlier reports of the use of relaxation in which a decrease in physiologic arousal occurs during dental procedures. It was suggested that the choice for use of the successful distraction procedures be based on other practical considerations.",doi,10.14219/jada.archive.1984.0034,Scopus,Journal of the American Dental Association (1939),"Seyrek S.K., Corah N.L., Pace L.F.",1984,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Competing And Collaborating Brains: Multi-Brain Computer Interfacing,"In this chapter we survey the possibilities of brain-computer interface applications that assume two or more users, where at least one of the users’ brain activity is used as input to the application. Such ‘applications’ were already explored by artists who introduced artistic EEG applications in the early ‘seventies’ of the previous century. These early explorations were not yet supported by advanced signal process methods, simply because there was no computing support possible, and interest in artistic applications faded until it reappeared in more recent years. Research in neuroscience, signal processing, machine learning and applications in medical, assistive BCIs prevailed. It was supported by computer science that provided real-time and off-line processing to analyze and store large amounts of streaming or collected data. With the possibility to access cheap shared and distributed storage and processing power, as it became available in the last decade of the previous century and the first decade of this century, different kinds of BCI applications, following a general interest in digital games, interactive entertainment and social media, became visible. These are domains where experience, fun and emotions are more important than efficiency, robustness and control. BCI provides user and application with a new modality that can be manipulated and interpreted, in addition to other input modalities. This has been explored, but mostly from the point of view of a single user interacting with an application. In this chapter we look at BCI applications where more than one user is involved. Games are among the possible applications and there are already simple games where gamers compete or collaborate using brain signal information from one or more players. We consider extensions of current applications by looking at different types of multi-user games, including massively multi-player online role-playing games. We mention research —distinguishing between active and passive BCI—on multi-participant BCI in non-game contexts that provides us with information about the possibilities of collaborative and competitive multi-brain games and that allows us to develop a vision on such games. The results of the literature study are collected in a tablewhere we distinguish between the various forms of interaction between players (participants) in collaborative and competitive games and team activities. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",doi,10.1007/978-3-319-10978-7_12,Scopus,Intelligent Systems Reference Library,Nijholt A.,2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Competitive Two-Person Interactions Of Type-A And Type-B Individuals,"Forty subjects classified as either coronary-prone (Type A) or coronary-resistant (Type B) interacted in a mixed-motive game in pairs by pressing buttons which transmitted messages through a television screen while an electrocardiogram and digital blood volume pulse were computer monitored. Subjects could cooperate, compete, punish, reward, or withdraw during each interaction and could send 1 of 55 messages communicating feelings, requests, and intentions between interactions. Paired Type A's interacted more competitively and aggressively than paired Type B's. There were no significant differences between Type A's and Type B's in heart rate or digital vasomotor response during the interpersonal game.

,Computational Modeling For Addiction Medicine: From Cognitive Models To Clinical Applications,"Decision-making tasks that have good ecological validity, such as simulated gambling tasks, are complex, and performance on these tasks represents a synthesis of several different underlying psychological processes, such as learning from experience, and motivational processes such as sensitivity to reward and punishment. Cognitive models can be used to break down performance on these tasks into constituent processes, which can then be assessed and studied in relation to clinical characteristics and neuroimaging outcomes. Whether it will be possible to improve treatment success by targeting these constituent processes more directly remains unexplored. We review the development and testing of the Expectancy-Valence and Prospect-Valence Learning models from the past 10 years or so using simulated gambling tasks, in particular the Iowa and Soochow Gambling Tasks. We highlight the issues of model generalizability and parameter consistency, and we describe findings obtained from these models in clinical populations including substance use disorders. We then suggest future directions for this research that will help to bring its utility to broader research and clinical applications. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",doi,10.1016/bs.pbr.2015.07.032,Scopus,Progress in Brain Research,"Ahn W.Y., Dai J., Vassileva J., Busemeyer J.R., Stout J.C.",2016,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Computer-Based Cognitive Rehabilitation: The Core System,"Purpose: This work aims at providing a tool for supporting cognitive rehabilitation. This is a wide field, that includes a variety of diseases and related clinical pictures; for this reason the need arises to have a tool available that overcomes the difficulties entailed by what currently is the most common approach, that is, the so-called pen and paper rehabilitation. Methods: We first organized a big number of stimuli in an ontology that represents concepts, attributes and a set of relationships among concepts. Stimuli may be words, sounds, 2D and 3D images. Then, we developed an engine that automatically generates exercises by exploiting that ontology. The design of exercises has been carried on in synergy with neuropsychologists and speech therapists. Solutions have been devised aimed at personalizing the exercises according to both patients’ preferences and performance. Results: Exercises addressed to rehabilitation of executive functions and aphasia-related diseases have been implemented. The system has been tested on both healthy volunteers (n = 38) and patients (n = 9), obtaining a favourable rating and suggestions for improvements. Conclusions: We created a tool able to automate the execution of cognitive rehabilitation tasks. We hope the variety and personalization of exercises will allow to increase compliance, particularly from elderly people, usually neither familiar with technology nor particularly willing to rely on it. The next step involves the creation of a telerehabilitation tool, to allow therapy sessions to be undergone from home, thus guaranteeing continuity of care and advantages in terms of time and costs for the patients and the National Healthcare System (NHS).Implications for rehabilitation Cognitive impairments can greatly impact an individual's existence, appreciably reducing his abilities and autonomy, as well as sensibly lowering his quality of life. Cognitive rehabilitation can be used to restore lost brain function or slow down degenerative diseases. Computerization of rehabilitation entails many advantages, but patients–especially elderly people–might be less prone to the use of technology and consequently reluctant towards this innovative therapeutic approach. Our software system, CoRe, supports a therapist during the administration of rehabilitation sessions: exercises can be generated dynamically, thus reducing repetitivity, and patients' performance trends automatically analysed to facilitate the assessment of their progress. Tests performed on both healthy subjects and patients provided useful information that allowed us to define an implementation strategy able to reduce patients' resistance to computerized rehabilitation as much as possible. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",doi,10.3109/09638288.2015.1096969,Scopus,Disability and Rehabilitation,"Alloni A., Sinforiani E., Zucchella C., Sandrini G., Bernini S., Cattani B., Pardell D.T., Quaglini S., Pistarini C.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Computer Games To Teach Hygiene: An Evaluation Of The E-Bug Junior Game,"Handwashing, respiratory hygiene and antibiotic resistance remain major public health concerns. In order to facilitate an effective outcome when teaching the basic principles of hand and respiratory hygiene, educational interventions should first target school children. As computer games are ubiquitous in most children's lives, e-Bug developed computer games targeted at teaching children handwashing, respiratory hygiene and antibiotic resistance. The games were designed for two target audiences: junior school children (9-12 year olds); and senior school children (13-15 year olds). Between May and August 2009, the finalized junior game underwent an evaluation in three UK schools (in Glasgow, Gloucester and London), involving 62 children in the schools and ~ 1700 players accessing the junior game online. The e-Bug junior game consists of a number of levels of play, each of which promotes a set of learning outcomes (LOs). These LOs, complementary to those in the e-Bug packs, are expressed through the game mechanics (the rules of the game) rather than through story or dialogue. Although the junior game's evaluation demonstrated a statistically significant change in the knowledge for only a small number of given LOs, because many children had the required knowledge already before playing the game, this is e-Bug's first statistical study on the junior game and the first comprehensive evaluation of its kind. Future work includes a re-examination of the quiz-style questionnaires utilized in this study and an exploration of the potential knowledge change acquired strictly through engagement. © The Author 2011.

With interactive movies, we are able to build cyberspaces rich to the feeling of presence by applying computer graphics and 3D observation, and to get the feeling of complete immersion in these spaces, as if we were actually in them. In addition, it is possible to experience stories through interaction with other characters in the spaces. We first explain the concept of interactive movies and describe a first prototype system that we have developed. We then describe the construction of a second system, which we are currently developing, as well as several improvements in the system.",doi,10.1023/A:1008183800502,Scopus,"Journal of VLSI Signal Processing Systems for Signal, Image, and Video Technology","Nakatsu R., Tosa N., Ochi T.",2001,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,"Contextual Features Of Violent Video Games, Mental Models, And Aggression.","This experiment employed a 2 (third vs. first person) × 2 (blood on/off) × 2 (sex) design in order to examine the effects of two internal video game manipulations: the presence of blood and point of view on participants’ perceptions of the game. Overall, when the blood manipulation was on, participants perceived greater gore. Players were significantly more focused when they played in the third-person point of view than when they played in first person. Males were more involved in the game overall regardless of point of view, but females were more focused and involved when they played in third, not first, person. In addition, we wanted to see if game manipulations and perceptions of the game affected aggressive outcomes. Those who played the game in the blood-on condition had more physically aggressive intentions, and when players were more involved and immersed in the game, they reported greater hostility and physically aggressive intentions. Findings are discussed as they relate to mental models of media violence.",doi,10.1111/j.1460-2466.2006.00025.x,anderson2010,Journal of Communication,"Farrar, K., Krcmar, M., Nowak, K.",2006,NA,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Cooperative Mission Planning For Multi-Uav Teams,"The use of robotic agents, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), has motivated the development of numerous autonomous cooperative task allocation and planning methods for heterogeneous networked teams. Typically agents within the team have different roles and responsibilities, and ensuring proper coordination between them is critical for efficient mission execution. However, as the number of agents, system components, and mission tasks increase, planning for such teams becomes increasingly complex, motivating the development of algorithms that can operate in real-time dynamic environments. Given the complexity of the cooperative missions considered, there have been numerous solution approaches developed in recent years. This chapter provides an overview of three of the most common planning frameworks: integer programming, Markov decision processes, and game theory. The chapter also considers various architectural decisions that must be addressed when implementing online planning systems for multi-agent teams, providing insights on when centralized, distributed, and decentralized architectures might be good choices for a given application, and how to organize the communication and computation to achieve desired mission performance. Algorithms that can be utilized within the various architectures are identified and discussed, and future directions for research are suggested. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015.",doi,10.1007/978-90-481-9707-116,Scopus,Handbook of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,"Ponda S.S., Johnson L.B., Geramifard A., How J.P.",2015,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Coping With Racial Discrimination: The Role Of Substance Use,"Three studies tested the hypothesis that the relation between perceived racial discrimination and substance use reported in previous research is moderated by use of substances as a coping mechanism. Studies 1 and 2 were experimental studies of African American adolescents' and young adults' reactions to a discrimination experience. Results revealed that those who endorsed substance use-as-coping reported more willingness to use substances after experiencing discrimination. Study 3 was a prospective study of the relation between perceived discrimination and substance use over an 8-year period in African American adolescents. Results demonstrated that discrimination is associated with increases in substance use, but only among adolescents who endorse substance use-as-coping. Together, these three studies provide evidence that experiencing discrimination has both short- and long-term detrimental effects on African Americans' substance use, but significantly more so for those who adopt a pattern of using substances as a coping mechanism. © 2012 American Psychological Association.",doi,10.1037/a0027711,Scopus,Psychology of Addictive Behaviors,"Gerrard M., Stock M.L., Roberts M.E., Gibbons F.X., O'Hara R.E., Weng C.-Y., Wills T.A.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Coronary Thrombosis An Environmental Study,"The object of the study was to ascertain, if possible, any environmental feature influencing the death rate from coronary thrombosis between the ages of 45 and 64 years. Records were taken of the age, sex, and occupations of persons normally resident in the administrative county of Cheshire who died between these ages from June, 1956, to December, 1959, and an inquiry was carried out over a period of 17 months into the medical history and environmental particulars of 536 persons who had died aged 45 to 64 years from coronary thrombosis, and the results were compared with similar information from 642 controls of the same sex and age-erouos taken at random. The answers received indicate that approximately three-fifths of those who had died had been receiving medical treatment, though not necessarily for a cardiac condition for longer than six months. There was no evidence to establish that family circumstances, holidays, consumption of fat, alcohol, or tea, times of meals or of rising or going to bed, participation in sport or games, visits to club or hotel, employment (in the case of women), addiction to radio or television, overtime or night working, and whether the job was manual or not, heavy or light, affect the likelihood of death from coronary thrombosis. Only a very small percentage (2%) of men controls who had not received medical treatment in the past three years travelled more than 6 miles (9.6 km.) in each direction between home and work. The death rate among farmers and agricultural workers was much lower in middle age than that of any other socio-economic group, whether from general causes or from coronary thrombosis. Work involving walking, and gardening in leisure, lessened liability to death from coronary thrombosis. The death rate was highest among sedentary workers, particularly clerks. To hold a position of responsibility at work does not carry an increased risk. There was a higher death rate from coronary disease among smokers, but no evidence to suggest an association between death from coronary disease and pipe smoking. Evidence suggested that overweight among manual workers is associated with increased liability to death from coronary thrombosis. There were significantly fewer deaths among coffee drinkers. A number of observations, based on subjective evidence and therefore subject to suspicion, raise the possibility that psychological and temperamental factors, particularly worry, may increase liability to death from coronary disease. Heredity, so far as could be deduced from such an inqniry asthis is an influence. The answers to the questions show that there is no need for a person to restrict himself or herself from those ordinary pleasures of life discussed in this paper in order to avoid death from coronary thrombosis. © 1962, British Medical Journal Publishing Group.

,"Cracking The Walnut: Using A Computer Game To Impact Cognition, Emotion, And Behavior Of Highly Aggressive Fifth Grade Students","Three fifth grade highly aggressive students participated in a study examining effects of an aggression intervention game. Using single-subject multiple baseline research design, the effect of the game was measured across three domains: attribution of peer intent (cognitive), emotional response (affective) and behavior response (behavioral). The results indicate that, while there were observable individual differences, the game had an immediate impact on attribution of peer behavior across all participants, had a less predictable impact on reported behavioral reactions, and had no discernable impact on reported emotional response. Theoretical and practical implications of the study are discussed. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

,"Cynical Hostility Influences Anger, But Not Cardiovascular Reactivity During Competition With Harassment","Cynical hostility has been linked to coronary heart disease (CHD), and there is mixed support for the hypothesis that cynical hostility may contribute to CHD through exaggerated cardiovascular responses to anger-provoking stressors. The present study tested the influences of cynical hostility on affective and cardiovascular responses to provocation in 68 undergraduate men. Subjects were divided into high and low cynical hostility groups by a median split on Cook-Medley Hostility Scale scores, and half of the subjects in each group were harassed during competition on a video game. High hostile subjects reported greater anger than low hostile subjects during the competition, independently of harassment, and harassment produced stronger feelings of mistreatment, independently of hostility. Harassed subjects experienced larger systolic blood pressure responses only during an affect rating period after the competition, but the responses were not influenced by hostility. These findings provide further evidence that cynical hostility, anger, and cardiovascular reactivity are not simply nor consistently related. © 1995.",doi,10.1016/0167-8760(95)00013-I,Scopus,International Journal of Psychophysiology,Feisten G.,1995,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Design And Development Of A Virtual Reality Simulator For Advanced Cardiac Life Support Training,"The use of virtual reality (VR) training tools for medical education could lead to improvements in the skills of clinicians while providing economic incentives for healthcare institutions. The use of VR tools can also mitigate some of the drawbacks currently associated with providing medical training in a traditional clinical environment such as scheduling conflicts and the need for specialized equipment (e.g., high-fidelity manikins). This paper presents the details of the framework and the development methodology associated with a VR-based training simulator for advanced cardiac life support, a time critical, team-based medical scenario. In addition, we also report the key findings of a usability study conducted to assess the efficacy of various features of this VR simulator through a postuse questionnaire administered to various care providers. The usability questionnaires were completed by two groups that used two different versions of the VR simulator. One version consisted of the VR trainer with it all its features and a minified version with certain immersive features disabled. We found an increase in usability scores from the minified group to the full VR group. © 2013 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/JBHI.2013.2285102,Scopus,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,"Vankipuram A., Khanal P., Ashby A., Vankipuram M., Gupta A., DrummGurnee D., Josey K., Smith M.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Design And Evaluation Of A Personal Robot Playing A Self-Management Education Game With Children With Diabetes Type 1,"Objective To assess the effects of a personal robot, providing diabetes self-management education in a clinical setting on the pleasure, engagement and motivation to play a diabetes quiz of children (7–12) with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), and on their acquisition of knowledge about their illness. Methods Children with T1DM (N = 27) participated in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in which they played a diabetes mellitus self-management education (DMSE) game, namely a diabetes quiz, with a personal or neutral robot on three occasions at the clinic, or were allocated to a control group (care as usual). Personalised robot behaviour was based on the self-determination theory (SDT), focusing on the children's needs for competence, relatedness and autonomy. The SDT determinants pleasure, motivation and diabetes knowledge were measured. Child-robot interaction was observed, including level of engagement. Results Results showed an increase in diabetes knowledge in children allocated to the robot groups and not in those allocated to the control group (P =.001). After three sessions, children working with the personal robot scored higher for determinants of SDT than children with the neutral robot (P = .02). They also found the robot to be more pleasurable (P =.04), they answered more quiz questions correctly (P =.02), and were more motivated to play a fourth time (P = .03). The analysis of audio/video recordings showed that in regard to engagement, children with the personal robot were more attentive to the robot, more social, and more positive (P < .05). Conclusion The study showed how a personal robot that plays DMSE games and applies STD based strategies (i.e., provides constructive feedback, acknowledges feelings and moods, encourages competition and builds a rapport) can help to improve health literacy in children in an pleasurable, engaging and motivating way. Using a robot in health care could contribute to self-management in children with a chronic disease and help them to cope with their illness. © 2017",doi,10.1016/j.ijhcs.2017.06.001,Scopus,International Journal of Human Computer Studies,"Henkemans O.A.B., Bierman B.P.B., Janssen J., Looije R., Neerincx M.A., van Dooren M.M.M., de Vries J.L.E., van der Burg G.J., Huisman S.D.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Development Of A Telemetry System For Measuring Oxygen Uptake During Sports Activities,"A new system for continuous measurement of oxygen uptake by means of a telemeter has been developed. Oxygen uptake and pulmonary ventilation during rest and exercise were determined using a portable oxygen consumption meter (Oxylog). A small interface circuit between the Oxylog and the transmitter of a frequency modulated bio-telemeter system was designed and installed inside the Oxylog. Data from the transmitter were passed to a receiver and were fed into a microcomputer system. The microcomputer system displayed and printed out minute values of ventilation and oxygen uptake. The accuracy and reliability of the new system were checked by comparison with the traditional (Douglas bag) method. In the range &lt;801· min-1 of ventilation and &lt;21· min-1 of oxygen uptake, the system was not inferior to the Douglas bag method. The new system was applied for field continuous measurement of oxygen uptake during a doubles tennis game. The results of the application indicate that the telemetry system developed here is a very practical and useful way of measuring oxygen uptake during sports activities. © 1988 Springer-Verlag.",doi,10.1007/BF00418473,Scopus,European Journal of Applied Physiology and Occupational Physiology,"Ikegami Y., Hiruta S., Ikegami H., Miyamura M.",1988,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Development Of Emotion Recognition Interface Using Complex Eeg/Ecg Bio-Signal For Interactive Contents,"With the changes in the interface paradigm, a user may not be satisfied using only a behavior-based interface such as a mouse and keyboard. In this paper, we propose a real-time user interface with emotion recognition that depends on the need for skill development to support a change in the interface paradigm to one that is more human centered. The proposed emotion recognition technology may provide services to meet the need to recognize emotions when using contents. Until now, most studies on an emotion recognition interface have used a single signal, which was difficult to apply because of low accuracy. In this study, we developed a complex biological signal emotion recognition system that blends the ratio of an ECG for the autonomic nervous system and the relative power value of an EEG (theta, alpha, beta, and gamma) to improve the low accuracy. The system creates a data map that stores user-specific probabilities to recognize six kinds of feelings (amusement, fear, sadness, joy, anger, and disgust). It updates the weights to improve the accuracy of the emotion corresponding to the brain waves of each channel. In addition, we compared the results of the complex biological signal data set and EEG data set to verify the accuracy of the complex biological signal, and found that the accuracy had increased by 35.78%. The proposed system will be utilized as an interface for controlling a game and smart space for a user with high accuracy. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",doi,10.1007/s11042-016-4203-7,Scopus,Multimedia Tools and Applications,"Shin D., Shin D., Shin D.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Do Video Games Exert Stronger Effects On Aggression Than Film? The Role Of Media Interactivity And Identification On The Association Of Violent Content And Aggressive Outcomes,"This study investigated whether media interactivity would influence the short-term effects of violent content on audience aggression. The general aggression model, social cognitive theory, and character identification offered the theoretical framework. A random sample of 102 male college students were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: video game playing, recorded game-play watching, or movie watching. The results indicated that video game players (mediated enactive experience) experienced greater increases in aggressive affect, aggressive cognition, and physiological arousal than participants who watched recorded game play or comparable movie scenes (mediated observational experience). The study indicated that media interactivity in video game exacerbated the violent effect on short-term, aggressive responses. Character identification did not mediate the effect of media interactivity on aggression. Future studies should incorporate more comprehensive measures of character identification to investigate inconsistent findings regarding media interactivity and identification. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In the first experiment (regular behavioral experiment), subjects are paired to make decisions in a laboratory through a computer network platform. In the second experiment (neuroimaging experiment), the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technique is applied to observe similarities and differences in brain activities between the two elicitation methods. The results show that no significant difference is observed in the ordering behaviors between the two methods. Meanwhile, the neuroimaging data reveal that the strategy method induces comparable activations in similar brain regions, as does the direct-response method. Additionally, it is more likely that subjects adjust their decisions during the feedback phase, rather than during the decision phase. Our results indicate that, in multi-round game experiments without features such as emotion, the effect of the elicitation method is not likely to be exhibited. © 2015 Production and Operations Management Society.",doi,10.1111/poms.12515,Scopus,Production and Operations Management,"Zhao Y., Zhao X., Wang L., Chen Y., Zhang X.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Does Excessive Play Of Violent First-Person-Shooter-Video-Games Dampen Brain Activity In Response To Emotional Stimuli?,"The present case-control study investigated the processing of emotional pictures in excessive first-person-shooter-video-players and control persons. All participants of the fMRI experiment were confronted with pictures from four categories including pleasant, unpleasant, neutral content and pictures from the first-person-shooter-video-game 'Counterstrike'. Compared to controls, gamers showed a significantly lower activation of the left lateral medial frontal lobe while processing negative emotions. Another interesting finding of the study represents the higher activation of frontal and temporal brain areas in gamers when processing screen-shots from the first-person-shooter-video-game 'Counterstrike'. Higher brain activity in the lateral prefrontal cortex could represent a protection mechanism against experiencing negative emotions by down-regulating limbic brain activity. Due to a frequent confrontation with violent scenes, the first-person-shooter-video-gamers might have habituated to the effects of unpleasant stimuli resulting in lower brain activation. Individual differences in brain activations of the contrast Counterstrike > neutral pictures potentially resemble the activation of action-scripts related to the video-game. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",doi,10.1016/j.biopsycho.2011.09.014,Scopus,Biological Psychology,"Montag C., Weber B., Trautner P., Newport B., Markett S., Walter N.T., Felten A., Reuter M.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Dynamic Agent Based Simulation Of Welfare Effects Of Urban Disasters,"An agent based model for assessing the welfare impacts of urban disasters is presented. This couples a population allocation algorithm with a simulation platform. The fully articulated model fuses both bottom-up (locational choice for workplace, residence and daily activities) and top-down (land use and housing price) protocols. This study moves beyond current research by addressing economic welfare consequences of urban disasters. The resilience capabilities of different income groups are identified. This is illustrated for the Jerusalem central business district. Empirical results at the micro-scale suggest that physical destruction leads to a zero-sum game within the housing market in which wealthier residents hold an advantage over the poor. This results in the transformation of neighborhoods and displacement of poor and vulnerable populations. Low income groups lose both physical ground and the social support systems that go with location. Policy implications of these findings are discussed. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2016.06.005,Scopus,"Computers, Environment and Urban Systems","Grinberger A.Y., Felsenstein D.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Dynamic Behaviours Of Mix-Game Model And Its Application,"In this paper a minority game (MG) is modified by adding into it some agents who play a majority game. Such a game is referred to as a mix-game. The highlight of this model is that the two groups of agents in the mix-game have different bounded abilities to deal with historical information and to count their own performance. Through simulations, it is found that the local volatilities change a lot by adding some agents who play the majority game into the MG and the change of local volatilities greatly depends on different combinations of historical memories of the two groups. Furthermore, the analyses of the underlying mechanisms for this finding are made. The applications of mix-game mode are also given as an example. © 2006 Chin. Phys.

,Dynamic Game Difficulty Control By Using Eeg-Based Emotion Recognition,"Computer games are steadily one of major way to enjoy leisure time. Main goal of game entertainment is to keep the player's immersion. Thus, balance design taking game difficulty into account has an important role in game design. In recent years, a number of studies tried to adaptive difficulty by using various algorithms which detect player dependent difficulty. Most of these algorithms need customizing itself for each game. Measuring features which determine game difficulty is the major problem of these ways of game balancing. But, it can be easy by using the player's immersion during playing games. And, player's immersion is detected by analyzing electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. In this paper, we propose a dynamic game difficulty control system, by using this emotion recognition technique with PAD model by using players' EEG signals during playing a rhythm game which has three different difficulty levels. © 2014 SERSC.",doi,10.14257/ijca.2014.7.3.26,Scopus,International Journal of Control and Automation,"Park S., Sim H., Lee W.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Dynamic Hierarchical Reactive Controller Synthesis,"In the formal approach to reactive controller synthesis, a symbolic controller for a possibly hybrid system is obtained by algorithmically computing a winning strategy in a two-player game. Such game-solving algorithms scale poorly as the size of the game graph increases. However, in many applications, the game graph has a natural hierarchical structure. In this paper, we propose a modeling formalism and a synthesis algorithm that exploits this hierarchical structure for more scalable synthesis. We define local games on hierarchical graphs as a modeling formalism that decomposes a large-scale reactive synthesis problem in two dimensions. First, the construction of a hierarchical game graph introduces abstraction layers, where each layer is again a two-player game graph. Second, every such layer is decomposed into multiple local game graphs, each corresponding to a node in the higher level game graph. While local games have the potential to reduce the state space for controller synthesis, they lead to more complex synthesis problems where strategies computed for one local game can impose additional requirements on lower-level local games. Our second contribution is a procedure to construct a dynamic controller for local game graphs over hierarchies. The controller computes assume-admissible winning strategies that satisfy local specifications in the presence of environment assumptions, and dynamically updates specifications and strategies due to interactions between games at different abstraction layers at each step of the play. We show that our synthesis procedure is sound: the controller constructs a play that satisfies all local specifications. We illustrate our results through an example controlling an autonomous robot in a building with known floor plan and provide simulation results using an implementation of our algorithm on top of LTLMoP. © 2017, The Author(s).",doi,10.1007/s10626-017-0239-8,Scopus,Discrete Event Dynamic Systems: Theory and Applications,"Schmuck A.-K., Majumdar R., Leva A.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Educational Interventions - Computers For Delivering Education To Children With Respiratory Illness And To Their Parents,"Educational interventions for children with asthma can result in both clinical and psychological improvements. However, traditional education programs have been hampered by lack of resources and doubts concerning long-term benefits. Researchers have looked to computer technology to overcome some of these obstacles and respiratory conditions have been the focus for a number of educational computer programs. Computer education packages should have a robust theoretical basis. Many programs aim to improve children's confidence, self-esteem and feelings of control, all of which are linked to compliance and positive health behaviours. The specific skills and knowledge needed for effective self- management also need to be taught in order to equip the child for future independent self- care. Programs tend to be either a stand- alone game, promoting self- regulation and practicing of skills, or an internet- enabled package, which may provide a link to their healthcare provider and/or other people with a similar condition. Computer technology is flexible, can be tailored to individuals' information needs, provides ongoing educational support and promotes active learning. However, there can be problems around accessibility, both in terms of computer ownership and technological literacy. Furthermore, internet sites are largely unregulated and of variable quality. It is essential that educational computer interventions are evidence- based and rigorously evaluated to identify who will benefit most from these packages. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

,Effect Of Contact And No-Contact Small-Sided Games On Elite Handball Players,"This study aimed to investigate the effect of contact (C-SSG) and no-contact (NC-SSG) handball small-sided games (SSGs) on motion patterns and physiological responses of elite handball players. Twelve male handball players performed 10 C-SSG and 10 NC-SSG while being monitored through the heart rate (HR) and rate of perceived exertion (RPE) as physiological responses and time-motion activities profile using video-match analysis. Both game conditions resulted in similar HR responses (P > 0.05), but the NC-SSG led to a higher RPE scores. The time-motion activity analysis featured NC-SSG with a greater amount of walking (855.6 ± 25.1 vs. 690.6 ± 35.2 m) and backward movements (187.5 ± 12.3 vs. 142.5 ± 8.7 m) combined with fast running (232.3 ± 8.5 vs. 159.7 ± 5.7 m) and sprinting (79.5 ± 4.7 vs. 39.7 ± 3.7 m) activities (P < 0.001). Conversely, C-SSG had a higher percentage of jogging and sideway movements associated with greater frequency of jumping (0.87 ± 0.09 vs. 0.31 ± 0.06 nr) and physical contact (1.82 ± 0.55 vs. 0.25 ± 0.03 nr) events (P < 0.001). No between-regimen differences were found for the number of throws (P = 0.745). In addition, the RPE was significantly correlated with fast running relative distances (r = 0.909, P < 0.001) and sprinting relative distances (r = 0.939, P < 0.001). In conclusion, this investigation showed that both C-SSG and NC-SSG in team handball can effectively represent specifically oriented exercises, according to the sport-task and the performance demands. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",doi,10.1080/02640414.2016.1276296,Scopus,Journal of Sports Sciences,"Dello Iacono A., Martone D., Zagatto A.M., Meckel Y., Sindiani M., Milic M., Padulo J.",2018,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Effect Of Meditation On Stress-Induced Changes In Cognitive Functions,"Objectives: The objective of this study was to study the effects of meditation on stress-induced changes in cognitive functions. Methods: The study was conducted on 32 healthy adult male student volunteers who had never practiced meditation before the study. The study consisted of practicing 20 minutes of guided meditation and administration of psychologic stress to the subjects. The psychologic stress was administered to the subjects by asking them to play a (preselected) stressful computer game. The subjects were asked to meditate either before or after the administration of psychologic stress. For the control group measurements, the subjects were asked to wait quietly for an equivalent period of meditation time. Outcome measures: The outcome measures were galvanic skin response (GSR), heart rate (HR), electromyography (EMG), sympathetic reactivity (QTc/QS2 ratio), cortisol, and acute psychologic stress scores. The central nervous system functions were assessed using Wechsler memory scale and visual-choice reaction time (VCRT). These parameters were measured both at the beginning and at the end of the intervention, using a pre-post experimental test design. Results: Computer game stress was associated with a significant increase in physiologic (GSR, EMG, HR, QTc/QS2) and psychologic (acute stress questionnaire scores) markers of stress. Meditation was associated with relaxation (significant decrease in GSR, EMG, QTc/QS2, and acute stress questionnaire scores). Meditation, if practiced before the stressful event, reduced the adverse effects of stress. Memory quotient significantly increased, whereas cortisol level decreased after both stress and meditation. VCRT showed no significant change. Conclusions: Practice of meditation produced a relaxation response even in the young adult subjects who had never practiced meditation before. The practice of meditation reduced the physiologic stress responses without taking away the beneficial effect of stress, namely, improved memory scores. © Copyright 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",doi,10.1089/acm.2010.0142,Scopus,Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine,"Mohan A., Sharma R., Bijlani R.L.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Effects Of Affective Orientation And Video Game Play On Aggressive Thoughts And Behaviors.,"This study examined the effects of playing a violent video game on aggressive thoughts and behaviors and the moderating role of affective orientation in the violent video game–aggression relationship. Approximately 2 weeks after having their affective orientation measured, 59 participants (plus 5 additional participants) played a violent or nonviolent video game for 10 minutes. Participants then performed a word completion task and judged the researcher's competence, courtesy, and deservedness of financial support. Results show that participants who played the violent video game rated the researcher as less courteous and less deserving of financial support than did participants who played the nonviolent video game, and affective orientation and video game condition interacted to predict evaluations of courtesy and deservedness of financial support.",doi,10.1207/s15506878jobem4904_5,anderson2010,Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media,"Cicchiriool, V., Chory-Assad, R.M.",2006,NA,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Effects Of Embodiment And Gestures On Social Interaction In Drumming Games With A Humanoid Robot,"We present results from an empirical study investigating the effect of embodiment and minimal gestures in an interactive drumming game consisting of an autonomous child-sized humanoid robot (KASPAR) playing with child participants. In this study, each participant played three games with a humanoid robot that played a drum whilst simultaneously making (or not making) head gestures. The three games included the participant interacting with the real robot (physical embodiment condition), interacting with a hidden robot when only the sound of the robot is heard (disembodiment condition; note that the term 'disembodiment' is used in this paper specifically to refer to an experimental condition where a physical robot produces the sound cues, but is not visible to the participants), or interacting with a real-time image of the robot (virtual embodiment condition). We used a mixed design where repeated measures were used to evaluate embodiment effects and independent-groups measures were used to study the gestures effects. Data from the implementation of a human-robot interaction experiment with 66 children are presented, and statistically analyzed in terms of participants' subjective experiences and drumming performance of the human-robot pair. The subjective experiences showed significant differences for the different embodiment conditions when gestures were used in terms of enjoyment of the game, and perceived intelligence and appearance of the robot. The drumming performance also differed significantly within the embodiment conditions and the presence of gestures increased these differences significantly. The presence of a physical, embodied robot enabled more interaction, better drumming and turn-taking, as well as enjoyment of the interaction, especially when the robot used gestures. © 2009 VSP.",doi,10.1163/016918609X12518783330360,Scopus,Advanced Robotics,"Kose-Bagci H., Ferrari E., Dautenhahn K., Syrdal D.S., Nehaniv C.L.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Effects Of Gene × Attachment Interaction On Adolescents’ Emotion Regulation And Aggressive Hostile Behavior Towards Their Mothers During A Computer Game,"Adolescence is a time of increased emotionality and major changes in emotion regulation often elicited in autonomy-relevant situations. Both genetic as well as social factors may lead to inter-individual differences in emotional processes in adolescence. We investigated whether both 5-HTTLPR and attachment security influence adolescents’ observed emotionality, emotional dysregulation, and their aggressive hostile autonomy while interacting with their mothers. Eighty-eight adolescents at age 12 were observed in interaction with their mothers during a standardized, emotion eliciting computer game task. They were genotyped for the 5-HTTLPR, a repeat polymorphism in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene. Concurrent attachment quality was assessed by the Late Childhood Attachment Interview (LCAI). Results revealed a significant gene × attachment effect showing that ss/sl carriers of 5-HTTLPR show increased emotional dysregulation and aggressive hostile autonomy towards their mothers. The results of the study suggest that secure attachment in adolescence moderates the genetically based higher tendency for emotional dysregulation and aggressive reactions to restrictions of autonomy during emotional social interactions with their mothers. © 2016 Zimmermann and Spangler.",doi,10.3389/fnhum.2016.00254,Scopus,Frontiers in Human Neuroscience,"Zimmermann P., Spangler G.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,"Effects Of Hatha Yoga And African Dance On Perceived Stress, Affect, And Salivary Cortisol. Annals Of Behavioral Medicine : A Publication Of The Society Of Behavioral Medicine, 28(2), 114–8.","BACKGROUND: Dance and yoga have been shown to produce improvements in psychological well-being. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to examine some of the psychological and neuroendocrine response to these activities. METHODS: Sixty-nine healthy college students participated in one of three 90-min classes: African dance (n = 21), Hatha yoga (n= 18), or a biology lecture as a control session (n = 30). Before and after each condition participants completed the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), completed the Positive Affect and Negative Affect Schedule, and provided a saliva sample for cortisol. RESULTS: There were significant reductions in PSS and negative affect (ps < .0001) and Time x Treatment interactions (ps < .0001) such that African dance and Hatha yoga showed significant declines, whereas there was no significant change in biology lecture. There was no significant main effect for positive affect (p = .53), however there was a significant interaction effect (p < .001) such that positive affect increased in African dance, decreased in biology lecture, and did not change significantly in Hatha yoga. There was a significant main effect for salivary cortisol (p < .05) and a significant interaction effect (p < .0001) such that cortisol increased in African dance, decreased in Hatha yoga, and did not change in biology. Changes in cortisol were not significantly related to changes in psychological variables across treatments. There was 1 significant interaction effect (p = .04) such that change in positive affect and change in cortisol were negatively correlated in Hatha yoga but positively correlated in Africa dance and biology. CONCLUSIONS: Both African dance and Hatha yoga reduced perceived stress and negative affect. Cortisol increased in African dance and decreased in Hatha yoga. Therefore, even when these interventions produce similar positive psychological effects, the effects may be very different on physiological stress processes. One factor that may have particular salience is that amount of physiological arousal produced by the intervention.",doi,10.1207/s15324796abm2802_6,nagy2015,Annals of Behavioral Medicine : A Publication of the Society of Behavioral Medicine,"West, J., Otte, C., Geher, K., Johnson, J., Mohr, D.

,Effects Of Maternal Cortisol During Pregnancy On Children's Blood Pressure Responses,"Background: It is well established that birth weight has an effect on subsequent blood pressure. Predominantly experimental studies have also reported effects of altered corticosteroid levels on subsequent cardiovascular responses. In the current study, we have examined the effects of both birth weight and maternal cortisol levels in a cohort of mothers and their pre-adolescent children. Procedure: A total of 216 women and their 7- to 9-year-old children comprised the cohort. The women had been assessed for plasma cortisol during the first (n = 71), second (n = 72) and third (n = 73) trimester. Maternal cortisol had been measured on a fasting sample taken between 9 and 11 a.m. The children's blood pressure and heart rate were recorded in the resting state, in response to a 10-min video game stress challenge and during recovery. Resting values, incremental responses to stress and recovery were evaluated. Observation: Maternal cortisol levels increased with duration of pregnancy. There were inverse correlations between birth weight and all haemodynamic measures. The positive associations between maternal cortisol and children's haemodynamic measures were most evident in the first and second trimesters. Birth weight was inversely related to maternal cortisol. In multiple regression analyses, the effects of maternal cortisol were more consistent than those of birth weight. Conclusion: Both birth weight and maternal cortisol are predictive of children's resting and stress-modulated haemodynamic measures. The effects of birth weight may partly mediate the effects of maternal cortisol. © 2015 S.

,Effects Of Playing Video Games On Pain Response During A Cold Pressor Task,"Two studies assessed whether playing video games would significantly distract participants from painful stimulation via a cold pressor test. In Study 1, participants (8 men, 22 women, M age= 18.5 yr., SD= 1.3) in an action-oriented game condition tolerated pain for a longer time period and reported lower pain intensity ratings than those in a nonaction-oriented game or a nongame control condition. No differences were found on scores of aggressiveness, competitiveness, or prior video game experience, suggesting that these factors play little role. In Study 2, participants (14 men, 13 women, M age= 19.7 yr., SD= 1.3) engaged in six video game conditions (action, fighting, puzzle, sports, arcade, and boxing) and a nongame control condition. Video game play produced an increase in pulse, which was greatest during the action, fighting, sports, and boxing games. Pain tolerance was greatest during the sports and fighting games. Thus, certain games produce greater distraction, which may have implications for the medical field as an adjunct to pain management. © Perceptual and Motor Skills 2009.",doi,10.2466/PMS.108.2.439-448,Scopus,Perceptual and Motor Skills,"Raudenbush B., Koon J., Cessna T., McCombs K.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Effects Of Violent And Non-Violent Computer Game Content On Memory Performance In Adolescents,"The present study focuses on the short-term effects of electronic entertainment media on memory and learning processes. It compares the effects of violent versus nonviolent computer game content in a condition of playing and in another condition of watching the same game. The participants consisted of 83 female and 94 male adolescents with a mean age of 17.6 years. The dependent variables are memory for previously learnt verbal and visual material, memory for media-related content and physiological measures of stress (heart rate, cortisol, salivary alpha-amylase). Besides the group comparisons, potential mediation effects and gender differences were examined. The results show that violent content leads to a poorer memory performance for verbal material and to an increased heart rate. The heart rate, however, does not mediate the effect on memory performance. Genders differ regarding their abilities to memorise verbal and visual material, with females showing a better performance (independent of the experimental condition), and for memorising media-contents, where the males outperform females (also independent of experimental condition). The study supports the assumption that violent and arousing media content has a negative short-term effect on simultaneous information processing and learning and that there are gender-specific media effects. © Instituto Superior de Psicologia Aplicada, Lisboa, Portugal and Springer Science+Business Media BV 2010.",doi,10.1007/s10212-010-0047-0,Scopus,European Journal of Psychology of Education,"Maass A., Kollhörster K., Riediger A., MacDonald V., Lohaus A.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Electroencephalographic Assessment Of Player Experience: A Pilot Study In Affective Ludology,"Psychophysiological methods, such as electroencephalography (EEG), provide reliable high-resolution measurements of affective player experience. In this article, the authors present a psychophysiological pilot study and its initial results to solidify a research approach they call affective ludology, a research area concerned with the physiological measurement of affective responses to player-game interaction. The study investigates the impact of level design on brainwave activity measured with EEG and on player experience measured with questionnaires. The goal of the study was to investigate cognition, emotion, and player behavior from a psychological perspective. For this purpose, a methodology for assessing gameplay experience with subjective and objective measures was developed extending prior work in physiological measurements of affect in digital gameplay. The authors report the result of this pilot study, the impact of three different level design conditions (boredom, immersion, and flow) on EEG, and subjective indicators of gameplay experience. Results from the subjective gameplay experience questionnaire support the validity of our level design hypotheses. Patterns of EEG spectral power show that the immersion-level design elicits more activity in the theta band, which may support a relationship between virtual spatial navigation or exploration and theta activity. The research shows that facets of gameplay experience can be assessed with affective ludology measures, such as EEG, in which cognitive and affective patterns emerge from different level designs. © 2011 SAGE Publications.",doi,10.1177/1046878110378140,Scopus,Simulation and Gaming,"Nacke L.E., Stellmach S., Lindley C.A.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia

Game developers have led the vanguard in commercial distribution of movement-based interaction platforms. The tremendous success of Nintendo's Wii platform convinced game companies that movement was something players valued and wanted more of, and that it was a way to gain an even broader audience for gaming. Game designers use nested sets of goals and discoveries that keep players cognitively challenged as one powerful way to maintain engagement. Recent research has demonstrated that striking high power poses for just two minutes leads to changes in peoples' biochemistry as well as greater risk tolerance when completing a sample task directly afterward. The first approach is to closely read the work of commercial game designers.

,"Emotion, Content, And Context In Sound And Music","Computer game sound is particularly dependent upon the use of both sound artefacts and music. Sound and music are media rich in information. Audio and music processing can be approached from a range of perspectives which may or may not consider the meaning and purpose of this information. Computer music and digital audio are being advanced through investigations into emotion, content analysis, and context, and this chapter attempts to highlight the value of considering the information content present in sound, the context of the user being exposed to the sound, and the emotional reactions and interactions that are possible between the user and game sound. We demonstrate that by analysing the information present within media and considering the applications and purpose of a particular type of information, developers can improve user experiences and reduce overheads while creating more suitable, efficient applications. Some illustrated examples of our research projects that employ these theories are provided. Although the examples of research and development applications are not always examples from computer game sound, they can be related back to computer games.

,Emotional Face Identification In Youths With Primary Bipolar Disorder Or Primary Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder,"Objective: Bipolar disorder (BD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are often comorbid or confounded; therefore, we evaluated emotional face identification to better understand brain/behavior interactions in children and adolescents with either primary BD, primary ADHD, or typically developing controls (TDC). Method: Participants included individuals 7 to 17 years of age (overall sample mean age 12.40 ± 3.01 years), with ""narrow-phenotype"" pediatric BD (n = 30) or ADHD (n = 38), or typically developing controls (TDC) with no psychiatric disorders themselves or in their first-degree relatives (n = 41). In the BD group, comorbid diagnoses were allowed; however, youth in the ADHD group were excluded for comorbid mood or anxiety disorders. Patient groups were not excluded for psychotropic medication use. Emotional face identification was assessed using the computerized Diagnostic Analysis of Non-Verbal Accuracy (DANVA). Results: Participants with BD made significantly more identification errors on child happy faces than either TDCs (p =.03) or participants with ADHD (p =.01). Furthermore, youth with BD (0.33 ± 0.55) were more likely than youth with ADHD (0.11 ± 0.31) to make errors on low-intensity child happy faces (p =.05) but not high-intensity happy faces (p = NS). Participants with BD and ADHD made significantly more total errors in child face labeling than did TDCs, although participants with BD and ADHD did not differ from one another. Conclusion: Our data suggest that youths with BD have specific alterations in emotional face identification of happy faces, an important finding that supports theories that response to positively valenced emotional stimuli may be especially salient in BD.

The model is designed to explore people's behavior in certain circumstances, while under specified emotional states. Special attention was given to the thought process and actions displayed in the hypothetical scenarios. Also, we developed an experimental game program for the evaluation of our emotional decision making model. © 2009 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",doi,10.1007/978-3-540-92814-0_30,Scopus,Studies in Computational Intelligence,"Shihab K., Chalabi N.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia

,"Emotions In Social Computer Games: Relations With Bullying, Aggression, And School Belonging","This article explores the set of emotions expressed by middle school youth (n = 96) when participating in a social computer game. In this article, we present the design of the game, the instruments used to assess bullying in the physical world, and the analysis of the emotions expressed during gameplay and their association with aggressive behaviors. Participants completed surveys on bullying experiences prior to playing the game. The game required participants to form teams and answer two sets of trivia questions, in competitive and cooperative stages. Results show a relation between the roles that participants have in their physical social environment and how they play the virtual game, in terms of the type of emotions they display.

,Energy Expended By Boys Playing Active Video Games,"The purpose of this study was to: (1) determine energy expenditure (EE) during a range of active video games (AVGs) and (2) determine whether EE during AVGs is influenced by gaming experience or fitness. Twenty-six boys (11.4±0.8 years) participated and performed a range of sedentary activities (resting, watching television and sedentary gaming), playing AVGs (Nintendo® Wii Bowling, Boxing, Tennis, and Wii Fit Skiing and Step), walking and running including a maximal fitness test. During all activities, oxygen uptake, heart rate and EE were determined. The AVGs resulted in a significantly higher EE compared to rest (63-190%, p≤0.001) and sedentary screen-time activities (56-184%, p≤0.001). No significant differences in EE were found between the most active video games and walking. There was no evidence to suggest that gaming experience or aerobic fitness influenced EE when playing AVGs. In conclusion, boys expended more energy during active gaming compared to sedentary activities. Whilst EE during AVG is game-specific, AVGs are not intense enough to contribute towards the 60min of daily moderate-to-vigorous physical activity that is currently recommended for children. © 2010 Sports Medicine Australia.",doi,10.1016/j.jsams.2010.07.005,Scopus,Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport,"White K., Schofield G., Kilding A.E.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Energy Expenditure And Cardiovascular Responses To Seated And Active Gaming In Children,"Objective: To examine energy expenditure and cardiovascular responses in children during seated and active gaming. Design: Comparison study. Setting: Children's Exercise Laboratory, University of Hong Kong. Participants: Eighteen children (aged 6-12 years) recruited from local primary schools. Main Exposure: Active and seated computer games played by all participants. Main Outcome Measures: Resting energy expenditure and heart rate measured before gaming, during seated gaming, and during use of 2 active gaming formats (XaviX bowling and XaviX J-Mat; SSD Company Ltd, Shiga, Japan). We used repeated-measures analyses of variance to compare the outcome measures. Results: The energy expenditure was significantly higher during seated gaming (mean [SD], 1.31 [0.19] kcal/ min-1; P&lt;.001), XaviX bowling (1.89 [0.45] kcal/min-1; P&lt;.001), and XaviX J-Mat gaming (5.23 [1.63] kcal/ min-1; P&lt;.001) compared with rest. The energy expended above rest was significantly higher for the 2 active gaming formats (P&lt;.001 for both) compared with seated gaming. The heart rate was significantly higher during XaviX bowling (mean [SD, ]102 [20] beats/min-1; P&lt;.001) and XaviX J-Mat gaming (160 [20] beats/ min-1; P&lt;.001) compared with rest. Heart rate during the XaviX J-Mat gaming was significantly higher than during seated gaming (P&lt;.001). Conclusions: This study has shown that using active gaming media results in meaningful increases in energy expenditure and heart rate compared with the seated screen environment. Manipulating the gaming environment can provide children with appealing activity alternatives, and further development of ""exertainment"" interventions is warranted, in particular determination of sustainability. ©2008 American Medical Association.

,Enhancement Of Allergic Skin Wheal Responses In Patients With Atopic Eczema/Dermatitis Syndrome By Playing Video Games Or By A Frequently Ringing Mobile Phone,"Background: Playing video games causes physical and psychological stress, including increased heart rate and blood pressure and aggression-related feelings. Use of mobile phones is very popular in Japan, and frequent ringing is a common and intrusive part of Japanese life. Atopic eczema/dermatitis syndrome is often exacerbated by stress. Stress increases serum IgE levels, skews cytokine pattern towards Th2 type, enhances allergen-induced skin wheal responses, and triggers mast cell degranulation via substance P, vasoactive intestinal peptide and nerve growth factor. Materials and methods: (1) In the video game study, normal subjects (n = 25), patients with allergic rhinitis (n = 25) or atopic eczema/dermatitis syndrome (n = 25) played a video game (STREET FIGHTER II) for 2 h. Before and after the study, allergen-induced wheal responses, plasma levels of substance P, vasoactive intestinal peptide and nerve growth factor, and in vitro production of total IgE, antihouse dust mite IgE and cytokines were measured. (2) In the mobile phone study, normal subjects (n = 27), patients with allergic rhinitis (n = 27) or atopic eczema/dermatitis syndrome (n = 27) were exposed to 30 incidences of ringing mobile phones during 30 min. Before and after the study, allergen-induced wheal responses, plasma levels of substance P, vasoactive intestinal peptide and nerve growth factor were measured. Results: Playing video games had no effect on the normal subjects or the patients with allergic rhinitis. In contrast, playing video games significantly enhanced allergen-induced skin wheal responses and increased plasma levels of substance P, vasoactive intestinal peptide and nerve growth factors in the patients with atopic eczema/dermatitis syndrome. Moreover, playing video games enhanced in vitro production of total IgE and anti-house dust mite IgE with concomitant increased production of IL-4, IL-10 and IL-13 and decreased production of IFN-γ and IL-12 in the patients with atopic eczema/dermatitis syndrome. However, exposure to frequently ringing mobile phones significantly enhanced allergen-induced skin wheal responses, plasma levels of substance P, vasoactive intestinal peptide and nerve growth factors in the patients with atopic eczema/dermatitis syndrome, but not in the normal subjects or the patients with allergic rhinitis. Conclusion: Playing video games enhanced allergic responses with a concomitant increased release of substance P, vasoactive intestinal peptide and nerve growth factor, and skewing of the cytokine pattern toward Th2 type in the patients with atopic eczema/dermatitis syndrome. In addition, exposure to frequently ringing mobile phones also enhanced allergic responses with a concomitant increased release of substance P, vasoactive intestinal peptide and nerve growth factor Collectively, high technology causes stress, which in turn may aggravate symptoms of atopic eczema/dermatitis syndrome.",doi,10.1046/j.1365-2362.2003.01177.x,Scopus,European Journal of Clinical Investigation,Kimata H.,2003,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Enhancing Instructional Outcomes With Gamification: An Empirical Test Of The Technology-Enhanced Training Effectiveness Model,"Background Gamification, the use of game elements in non-game contexts, has become a popular technique to improve instructional outcomes in both organizational and educational contexts. In the organizational context, the Technology-Enhanced Training Effectiveness Model [TETEM] provides a framework to understand how technologies, like gamification, can effect change in various instructional outcomes. Specifically, application of TETEM suggests that gamification may not effect change in instructional outcomes when learner attitudes towards game-based learning and experience with video games are low. Method In this study, we test this model in the gamification context by assigning potential learners to read scenarios describing gamified instruction or traditional, PowerPoint instruction in a random order and assessing their training valence. Results On average, participants anticipated greater value from gamified instruction, but as predicted by TETEM, this effect was moderated by both video game experience and attitudes towards game-based learning. Among potential learners with high experience and attitudes, gamification produces better outcomes than PowerPoint, but among potential learners with low experience and attitudes, gamification produces worse outcomes than PowerPoint. Implications We provide empirical support for TETEM and conclude that for gamification to be successful, the attitudes and experience of participants must be assessed and ensured before gamification is implemented. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd",doi,10.1016/j.chb.2015.07.031,Scopus,Computers in Human Behavior,"Landers R.N., Armstrong M.B.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Enhancing The Navigability In A Social Network Of Smart Objects: A Shapley-Value Based Approach,"The Internet of Things (IoT) holds the promise to interconnect any possible object capable of providing useful information about the physical world for the benefit of humans' quality of life. The increasing number of heterogeneous objects that the IoT has to manage introduces crucial scalability issues that still need appropriate solutions. In this respect, one promising proposal is the Social IoT (SIoT) paradigm, whose main principle is to enable objects to autonomously establish social links with each other (adhering to rules set by their owners). ""Friend"" objects exchange data in a distributed manner and this avoids centralized solutions to implement major functions, such as: node discovery, information search, and trustworthiness management. However, the number and types of established friendships affect network navigability. This issue is the focus of this paper, which proposes an efficient, distributed and dynamic solution for the objects to select the right friends for the benefit of the overall network connectivity. The proposed friendship selection mechanism relies on a game theoretic model and a Shapley-value based algorithm. Two different utility functions are defined and evaluated based on either a group degree centrality and an average local clustering parameter. The comparison in terms of global navigability is measured in terms of average path length for the interconnection of any couple of nodes in the network. Results show that the group degree centrality brings to an enhanced degree of navigability thanks to the ability to create a suitable core of hubs. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

,Ergonomic Evaluation Of Video Game Playing,"This study investigated the effect of display type, play-rest schedule and game type on visual fatigue, heart rate and mental workload for both genders during 1 h of Wii game playing. Twenty subjects participated in the experiment. Two display types (a 32-in CRT display and a 32-in plasma display), two different play-rest schedules (10 min play with 5 min rest, repeated four times; 20 min play with 10 min rest, repeated two times) and two Nintendo “Wii Sports” games (boxing and tennis) were used for evaluation. The study results showed that the display and game type had a significant effect on all the measurements. The use of a plasma display to play video games improved the critical flicker fusion (CFF) frequency threshold; however, it also caused a greater subjective eye-fatigue rating, increased heart rate, as well as higher mental workload. Subjects with a 5-min break for every 10 min played had a lower subjective eye-fatigue rating, heart rate and mental workload than with a 10-min break for every 20 min played. The gender effect was not significant on any of the measurements. Implications of the results regarding video-game playing are discussed in terms of display and game type. Playing video games with frequent short breaks is suggested for reducing visual fatigue, especially for intensive video games. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",doi,10.1007/s12652-016-0386-z,Scopus,Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing,"Chen S.-J., Kang Y.-Y., Lin C.-L.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia

,"Ethnicity, Pressor Reactivity, And Children's Blood Pressure: Five Years Of Observations","During the 5 years of this investigation, resting blood pressure and presser reactivity were measured in 292 white children and 46 black children in 1987, 1988, 1989, and 1991. In 1987, all children were in the third grade; in 1991, the children were in the seventh grade. Reactivity was assessed with a standardized psychological Stressor, a television video game. Children displayed significant stability of absolute blood pressure and heart rate reactivity between grades 3 and 7. At all examinations, black children demonstrated blood pressure reactivity that was significantly greater in magnitude (both absolute level and change from resting measurements) than that of white children. Black children exhibited significantly greater heart rate reactivity only when defined as change from the resting measurements; absolute levels of heart rate reactivity were comparable for blacks and whites. For black children, blood pressure reactivity in 1987 was the strongest predictor of resting blood pressure (both systolic and diastolic) in 1991. Among white children, resting blood pressure was the strongest predictor of future resting blood pressure. Further research is needed to determine if ethnic differences in children's pressor reactivity are associated with ethnic differences in the prevalence of hypertension.",doi,10.1161/01.HYP.20.3.327,Scopus,Hypertension,"Murphy J.K., Alpert B.S., Walker S.S.",1992,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Evaluating The Nintendo Wii For Assessing Return To Activity Readiness In Youth With Mild Traumatic Brain Injury,"Adolescents with mild traumatic brain injuries (MTBI) are at substantial risk for repeat injury if they return to activity too soon. Post-concussion symptoms and impaired balance are two factors that limit return to activity. Post-injury assessments that challenge activity tolerance and balance skills are needed to ensure readiness to return to activity. This cross-sectional study evaluated the Nintendo Wii as a measure of exertion (heart rate HR, respiration rate RR, and caloric expenditure) and balance testing for youth with MTBI in a clinical setting. Twenty-four youth with MTBI, ages 9-18, played six Wii games. The Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency 2nd edition (BOT-2) and the Community Balance and Mobility Scale (CBM) were used as balance indicators. The Wii Fit Running game demonstrated the highest caloric expenditure and HR (p = .010). Frequency counts of balance loss during Wii game play did not correlate with performance on the BOT-2 or the CBM. Type, number, and time since injury were predictive of balance performance on the CBM (p = .008). Findings provide preliminary evidence for the use of the Wii as an exertion challenge to evaluate tolerance for exercise post-concussion. Frequency count of balance loss during Wii game play, however, was not a valid measure of balance impairment post-MTBI. © 2014 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.",doi,10.3109/01942638.2014.885103,Scopus,Physical and Occupational Therapy in Pediatrics,"Dematteo C., Greenspoon D., Levac D., Harper J.A., Rubinoff M.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia

,Evaluations Of Emotional Noninterpersonal Situations By Patients With Borderline Personality Disorder,"According to cognitive models of borderline personality disorder (BPD), an important cause for the instability of patients with BPD is dichotomous thinking (DT). Object-relation theories assume that the similar phenomenon of splitting is central in BPD. Previous studies focusing on interpersonal situations found support for DT being prominent in BPD. The aim of this study was to investigate whether patients with BPD also make use of dichotomous and schema-specific evaluations in noninterpersonal situations. An experiment was designed in which a frustrating and rewarding situation was induced by computer games that subjects had to play. Participants evaluated both themselves and the games. Patients with BPD (n=24) were characterized by somewhat more extreme game evaluations in the emotionally negative situations than normal controls (n=25), participants with a cluster C (n=10) or an anti-social personality disorder (ASPD) (n=16). Patients with BPD appeared to be characterized best by a general negative evaluative style, more than by DT or splitting. ASPD participants showed a positivity bias in both conditions. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

,Evolution Is Not Enough: Revolutionizing Current Learning Environments To Smart Learning Environments,"Advances in technology in recent years have changed the learning behaviors of learners and reshaped teaching methods. This had resulted in several challenges faced by current educational systems, such as an increased focus on informal learning, a growing gap of prior knowledge among students in classrooms and a mismatch between individual career choices and the development of the work force. This paper looks at these challenges with a view towards revolutionizing current learning environments to smart learning environments and provides new suggestions for technological solutions. Furthermore, this paper argues for a transformation from the current learning environments to smart learning environments. This is to be achieved by reengineering the fundamental structure and operations of current educational systems to better integrate these new technologies with the required pedagogical shift. The future perspectives of smart learning environments are reviewed and shared, through examples of emerging innovations such as the flipped classroom, game based learning, gesture based learning, along with pedagogical shifts, such as life-long learning portfolio maintenance, team teaching, and separation of learning and competency assessment. © 2016 International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society.",doi,10.1007/s40593-016-0108-x,Scopus,International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education,"Kinshuk, Chen N.-S., Cheng I.-L., Chew S.W.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Evolutionary Behavior Tree Approaches For Navigating Platform Games,"Computer games are highly dynamic environments, where players are faced with a multitude of potentially unseen scenarios. In this paper, AI controllers are applied to the Mario AI benchmark platform, by using the grammatical evolution system to evolve behavior tree structures. These controllers are either evolved to both deal with navigation and reactiveness to elements of the game or used in conjunction with a dynamic A∗ approach. The results obtained highlight the applicability of behavior trees as representations for evolutionary computation and their flexibility for incorporation of diverse algorithms to deal with specific aspects of bot control in game environments. © 2009-2012 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TCIAIG.2016.2543661,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games,"Nicolau M., Perez-Liebana D., Oneill M., Brabazon A.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,"Exercise Intensity And Technical Demands Of Small-Sided Games In Young Brazilian Soccer Players: Effect Of Number Of Players, Maturation, And Reliability","The aims of this study were to examine in young soccer players (a) the effect of varying the number of players on exercise intensity (EI) and technical actions during small-sided games (SSGs), (b) the reliability of EI and technical actions, and (c) the influence of the players' maturation on EI and involvements with the ball (IWBs). Sixteen male soccer players (mean ± SD; age 13.5 ± 0.7 years, height 164 ± 7 cm, and weight 51.8 ± 8 kg) completed 2 bouts of 3 vs. 3 (SSG3), 4 vs. 4 (SSG4), and 5 vs. 5 (SSG5) training. Exercise intensity was measured using heart rate and expressed as a percentage of maximal heart rate (%MHR). Technical actions were quantified from video recordings. Maturation stage was determined with the Tanner scale. Exercise intensity in SSG3 (89.8 6 2%MHR) was higher (p < 0.003) than that in SSG5 (86.9 6 3%MHR). The EI in the first set (86.8 6 4%MHR) was lower (p < 0.001) than that in the second (89.1 6 3%MHR) and in the third set (89.4 6 3%MRH). No effects of number of players were found in IWB, passes, target passes, tackles, and headers. Significantly more crosses, dribbling, and shots on goal were observed during SSG3 compared to during SSG4 or SSG5 (p < 0.05). The typical error for EI, expressed as coefficient of variation, ranged from 2.2 to 3.4%. The reliability for the most frequent technical actions ranged from 6.8 to 19.3%. The level of maturation was not correlated with either EI or IWB. These results extend previous findings with adult players suggesting that SSGs can provide an adequate training stimulus for young players and are feasible for groups with heterogeneous maturation levels. © 2011 National Strength and Conditioning Association.",doi,10.1519/JSC.0b013e31820da061,Scopus,Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research,"Da Silva C.D., Impellizzeri F.M., Natali A.J., De Lima J.R.P., Bara-Filho M.G., Silami-Garcxia E., Marins J.C.B.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Feasibility And Observed Safety Of Interactive Video Games For Physical Rehabilitation In The Intensive Care Unit: A Case Series,"Background: Early rehabilitation in the intensive care unit (ICU) improves patients' physical function. Despite reports of using commercially available interactive video game systems for rehabilitation, there are few data evaluating feasibility and safety as part of routine in-patient rehabilitation, particularly in the ICU. Methods: We conducted an observational study from September 1, 2009, to August 31, 2010, of adults admitted to a 16-bed medical ICU receiving video games as part of routine physical therapy (PT), evaluating use and indications and occurrence of 14 prospectively monitored safety events. Results: Of 410 patients receiving PT in the medical ICU, 22 (5% of all patients; male, 64%; median age, 52 years) had 42 PT treatments with video games (median [interquartile range] per patient, 1.0 [1.0-2.0]). Main indications for video game therapy included balance (52%) and endurance (45%), and the most common activities included boxing (38%), bowling (24%), and balance board (21%). Of 42 treatments, 69% occurred while standing and 45% while mechanically ventilated. During 35 hours of PT treatment, 0 safety events occurred (95% upper confidence limit for safety event rate, 8.4%). Conclusions: Novel use of interactive video games as part of routine PT in critically ill patients is feasible and appears safe in our case series. Video game therapy may complement existing rehabilitation techniques for ICU patients. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",doi,10.1016/j.jcrc.2011.08.017,Scopus,Journal of Critical Care,"Kho M.E., Damluji A., Zanni J.M., Needham D.M.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Feasibility Of Using Active Video Gaming As A Means For Increasing Energy Expenditure In Three Nonambulatory Young Adults With Disabilities,"Objective: To examine the feasibility of adapting active video games (AVGs) for nonambulatory wheelchair users at functionally diverse levels and to examine these AVGs as a method for increasing energy expenditure (EE) for 3 young adults with severe (SEV), moderate (MOD), and no upper extremity limitation (NL). Design: Case study. Setting: Residential special education school for youth and young adults with physical disabilities. Participants: Two young adults with spastic cerebral palsy (SEV, MOD) and one young adult with spina bifida (NL). All participants were nonambulatory wheelchair users. Methods: Each participant performed Wii bowling and tennis and an adapted upper extremity version of a Dance Dance Revolution (DDR) game pad. Main Outcome Measurements: EE was measured through indirect calorimetry (VO2). Heart rate data were collected with the use of a Polar Heart Rate Monitor. Results: SEV and MOD participants showed a higher percentage increase in EE for the Wii games (SEV, 25.6%; MOD, 30.8%) compared with DDR (SEV, 10.8%; MOD, 29.1%), whereas the participant with NL had a greater EE increase for the DDR (173.5%) compared with Wii (59.5%). Conclusions: AVGs showed clinically significant increases in EE for all 3 participants and can be performed by nonambulatory wheelchair users ranging from those with NL to those with SEV upper extremity limitation with the appropriate adaptations. © 2012 American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.",doi,10.1016/j.pmrj.2012.03.011,Scopus,PM and R,"Rowland J.L., Rimmer J.H.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia

,"Flux Variation In A Siberian Taiga Forest Near Yakutsk Estimated By A One-Dimensional Model With Routine Data, 1986-2000","For a larch forest site near Yakutsk, energy and water fluxes are estimated and their variations are investigated using a one-dimensional land surface model with daily routine data. The estimation period is 1986-2000, including the period before the start of tower observation (1997) on the left bank of the Lena River. The land surface model includes three submodels: vegetation, snow cover, and soil. The model can calculate water and energy fluxes above and within the forest if meteorological data over the forest are given as input. Data used in this study are Baseline Meteorological Data in Siberia (BMDS) Version 3. This set comprises daily data of main meteorological elements. The procedure is as follows: (1) preparation of equations between routine Yakutsk data and larch tower data; (2) estimation of past meteorological data over the taiga using those equations; and (3) estimation of fluxes using the one-dimensional model. The date of leaf-out start is parameterized with soil temperature and accumulated air temperature. It corresponds to the green-up time obtained from satellite normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data. Estimated monthly deviation of net radiation, Rn, is 10 Wm-2. Its maximum is 20 Wm-2. The monthly deviation of latent heat flux, LE, is less than 12 Wm-2. Its warm season average is less than 7 Wm-2. Although the magnitude of LE is almost zero in December and January, and several Wm-2 aside from these 2 months, the sensible heat flux, H, sometimes becomes negative during the cold season. The variation of evapotranspiration is considerably smaller than that of precipitation. The evapotranspiration (E) normalized by potential evaporation (Ep), E/Ep is 0.37-04 in the warm season; it tends to be large when leaf-out starts early. The amount of evapotranspiration in the warm season can be estimated from Ep within an error of 5 mm using this relationship.

,Formalizing Emergence: The Natural After-Life Of Artificial Life,"Originally, the field of Artificial Life was born out of the frustration and isolation felt by some ""hackers"" keen on cellular automata, game of life, genetic algorithms, L-systems and other computer recreations. Fascinated by this surprising cohabitation of programming simple algorithms and the complex working of these same algorithms (this new perception of complex phenomena as emerging from simple algorithms but iterated, distributed and recursive), convinced of the interest of their works for theoreticians of biology but aware of the lack of dialogue with them, they organized a series of workshops whose desired originality was multidisciplinarity and the coming together of researchers sharing the same will to understand the mechanisms and functions characterizing living organisms. These researchers in computer science, mathematics, physics, biology, robotics, philosophy, now meet every year, alternatively in Europe and the USA. What is discussed as inherent to all living organisms, and therefore which represents the bulk of the material dealt with during these workshops, are the mechanisms of self-organization or of the ""emerging functionalities"" opposing a centralized vision of biology, the need to better balance the coupling of the studied objects with their environment opposing a solipsistic methodology still representative of a certain artificial intelligence, the compulsory passage via the mechanisms of learning and adaptation as the most simple and autonomous way to face the complexity typical of the architecture and dynamics of these systems and, finally, the study of this complexity per se. A same motto brings together all these researchers: ""some form of complexity can be faced and domesticated very simply by relying on the computer brute force"". The mascots that are most representative of artificial life are: robotic insectoids, the game of life and other cellular automata, genetic algorithms, L-systems and simulations of ecosystems. These first workshops, due to the originality of the process, created a considerable stir. They undoubtedly seemed to reach their primary target, that is to allow better communication between researchers. Today, however, a certain breathlessness is noticeable which goes not without reminding the same dying down that characterized the cybernetic and systemic trends (Alife fathers) of the forties and fifties. The multidisciplinarity although essential to the inspiration does not survive, in principle, the specialization which arises naturally as a consequence of several years of study dedicated to a same subject and which drive researchers to privilege interlocutors sharing their same narrow and deep interest. Gradually new scientific communities appear with a more focused object of study and which, either free themselves of the mother field (like genetic algorithms or cellular automata) or become connected with existing communities (like robotics, study of ecosystems, study of the origin of life, study of insects societies). As we can notice during these workshops, ""life"" resists whatever unique and narrow definition. This diversity is the de-stabilizing factor which could cause the burst of artificial life. Besides, the risk is important of a forthcoming divorce, which has already taken place in artificial intelligence, between a so called ""strong"" science which could fuse with an existing scientific tradition (cognitive science for AI and theoretical biology for artificial life) and its so called ""weak"" counterpart with a more engineering like aftertaste and leading to technological innovations (expert systems, fuzzy logic and knowledge engineering in AI, neural networks, genetic algorithms and autonomous robotics in artificial life). If the artificial life star turns into a supernovae to finally explode and leaves behind, as relics of its glorious past, one and only one scientific pulsar, more focused, firmly grounded, and, above all, perpetrating as well as possible the original enthusiasm, the best candidate I can see could be a more formalized study of the emergent phenomena. My contribution to this characterization of emergent phenomena is currently limited to two of them appearing in a large amount of biological networks: the de-stabilizing effect of frustrated connectivity and the tendency to fragment the whole network into small clusters of units showing similar behavior. Among the networks showing these two emergent properties, the attention will be paid to only two of them: Hopfield Neural Networks (HNN) and Idiotypic Immune Networks (INN). Frustrated connectivity is responsible for perturbing the equilibrium dynamics of the network and provoking ""wavering"" among alternative equilibrium regimes. When frustrated a homeostatic network exhibits oscillatory behavior while an oscillatory network falls into a new type of chaotic regime which will be designated as frustrated chaos. In HNN, there is a threshold in the degree of connectivity which marks a sharp transition into the dynamics of the network. Below this threshold, i.e. in the case of a strongly diluted connectivity, the network clusters itself into small group of oscillatory units. In IIN also, this clustering phenomenon prevails and follows very regular rules for the dimension and the distribution of the clusters. It is clear that these two properties can be regarded as emergent since in order to appear they require a specific collective configuration of the units, and in order to be detected they require a level of observation which transcends each unit taken separately. In this paper, rather than theoretical analysis, results of computer simulation are given and briefly explained to illustrate these common properties.© 2006 Springer.

,Formation Preserving Path Finding In 3-D Terrains,"Navigation of a group of autonomous agents that are required to maintain a formation is a challenging task which has not been studied much especially in 3-D terrains. This paper presents a novel approach to collision free path finding of multiple agents preserving a predefined formation in 3-D terrains. The proposed method could be used in many areas like navigation of semi-automated forces (SAF) at unit level in military simulations and non-player characters (NPC) in computer games. The proposed path finding algorithm first computes an optimal path from an initial point to a target point after analyzing the 3-D terrain data from which it constructs a weighted graph. Then, it employs a real-time path finding algorithm specifically designed to realize the navigation of the group from one waypoint to the successive one on the optimal path generated at the previous stage, preserving the formation and avoiding collision. Software was developed to test the methods discussed here. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.",doi,10.1007/s10489-010-0265-9,Scopus,Applied Intelligence,"Bayrak A.G., Polat F.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Formative Assessment Can Be Fun As Well As Educational.,"An understanding of the hormonal basis of normal growth and development, including the changes occurring at puberty, is important foundation knowledge for contemporary medical practice in most fields of medicine. A quiz, testing the important physiological concepts of growth and puberty, was designed using the format of the well-known television game ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire."" An evaluation of this formative assessment activity revealed that a cohort of first-year undergraduate medical students valued learning with peers in an enjoyable, interactive environment, where they were able to admit to uncertainties and clarify answers. It also showed that making an educational activity fun need not detract from the focus of giving feedback on learning. Formative assessment, known to produce learning gains in a range of educational settings, is an important activity in contemporary medical education. With a greater emphasis on self-directed learning and less well-defined curriculum boundaries, feedback helps students to understand and apply the important physiological concepts that underpin the practice of medicine.",doi,10.1152/advan.00040.2005,pubmed,Advances in physiology education,"Hudson, J N; Bristow, D R",2006,NA,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,"Full Of Sound And Fury, Signifying Something: The Impact Of Autonomic Arousal On Egm Gambling","An experiment was conducted to observe the influence of autonomic arousal on subsequent gambling behavior. Thirty-seven male and 32 female regular Electronic Gaming Machine (EGM) players were recruited through newspaper advertisements. Participants were randomly assigned to either: (1) a control condition, or (2) an experimental condition that introduced a loud white-noise event (80 db) at fixed 120 s intervals throughout the 5-min EGM gambling session. Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) measurements showed that the manipulation was successful in elevating autonomic arousal. The results showed differences in behavioral response to the manipulation based on prior experience with gambling problems. Persons with many gambling problems had lower average bet-sizes in the white-noise condition compared to the control, while those with few or no problems had higher average bet-sizes. The results suggest that arousal may provide different signals to gamblers with few versus many problems. Gamblers with many problems may interpret their arousal as a sign that they will soon lose money, while gamblers with few or no problems may associate feelings of arousal exclusively with winning. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.",doi,10.1007/s10899-007-9061-9,Scopus,Journal of Gambling Studies,"Rockloff M.J., Signal T., Dyer V.",2007,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Game-Theoretic Mechanisms To Increase Data Availability In Decentralized Storage Systems,"In a decentralized storage system, agents replicate each other's data to increase availability. Compared to organizationally centralized solutions, such as cloud storage, a decentralized storage system requires less trust in the provider and may result in smaller monetary costs. Our system is based on reciprocal storage contracts that allow the agents to adopt to changes in their replication partners' availability (by dropping inefficient contracts and forming new contracts with other partners). The data availability provided by the system is a function of the participating agents' availability. However, a straightforward system in which agents' matching is decentralized uses the given agent availability inefficiently. As agents are autonomous, the highly available agents form cliques replicating data between each other, which makes the system too hostile for the weakly available newcomers. In contrast, a centralized, equitable matching is not incentive compatible: it does not reward users for keeping their software running. We solve this dilemma by a mixed solution: an ""adoption"" mechanism in which highly available agents donate some replication space, which in turn is used to help the worst-off agents. We show that the adoption motivates agents to increase their availability (is incentive-compatible), but also that it is sufficient for acceptable data availability for weakly-available agents. © 2015 ACM.",doi,10.1145/2723771,Scopus,ACM Transactions on Autonomous and Adaptive Systems,"Rzadca K., Datta A., Kreitz G., Buchegger S.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,"Gender Stereotypes, Aggression, And Computer Games: An Online Survey Of Women.","Computer games were conceptualized as a potential mode of entry into computer-related employment for women. Computer games contain increasing levels of realism and violence, as well as biased gender portrayals. It has been suggested that aggressive personality characteristics attract people to aggressive video games, and that more women do not play computer games because they are socialized to be non-aggressive. To explore gender identity and aggressive personality in the context of computers, an online survey was conducted on women who played computer games and women who used the computer but did not play computer games. Women who played computer games perceived their online environments as less friendly but experienced less sexual harassment online, were more aggressive themselves, and did not differ in gender identity, degree of sex role stereotyping, or acceptance of sexual violence when compared to women who used the computer but did not play video games. Finally, computer gaming was associated with decreased participation in computer-related employment; however, women with high masculine gender identities were more likely to use computers at work.",doi,10.1089/cpb.2004.7.714,anderson2010,CyberPsychology & Behavior,"Norris, K.

,Globalization In The World Of Finance: An Analytical History,"One of the many definitions of financial globalization is integration of domestic financial system of a country with the global financial markets and institutions. Enabling framework of financial globalization essentially includes liberalization and deregulation of the domestic financial sector as well as liberalization of the capital account. As economies progressively integrate globally, pari passu the financial structures of markets and the world of finance change. Financial globalization cannot be considered a novel phenomenon. Trans-country capital movements are centuries old. The oil shock of 1973 and the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, both of these developments were momentous and were responsible for laying the foundation of the contemporary era of financial globalization. After the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, some middle-income developing economies began to liberalize and open up for greater capital mobility, while keeping an autonomous control over their monetary policy. Advances in IT and computer technology are cited as one of the most important factors driving and supporting financial globalization. Transnational corporations (TNCs) also helped in global financial integration. They expanded their networks by merging with or acquiring other national and international firms. The prime movers in financial globalization are governments, borrowers, investors, and financial institutions. Each one of these market participants propelled economies towards financial integration in a proactive manner. Financial globalization has caused dramatic changes in the structure of national and international capital markets. The most significant change in the capital markets was in the banking system, which went through a process of dis-intermediation. This was a market transformation of fundamental nature. Contagions and crises are the downsides of financial globalization. Economic and financial crises of the 1990s portend to the fact that financial globalization is not a win-win game, and that it can potentially lead to serious disorder and high cost in terms of bank failures, corporate bankruptcies, stock market turbulence, depletion of foreign exchange reserves, currency depreciation and increased fiscal burden. A unique characteristic of globalized financial markets is reversal of capital flows when market perception regarding the creditworthiness of the borrowing entity changes. Cross-country financial flows to the emerging market economies were low, at during the mid-1970s. They increased at a healthy clip during the decades of 1980s and 1990s, peaking in 1997. They suffered a sharp decline after that because of the Asian and Russian financial and economic crises. The composition of external capital underwent a dramatic transformation during this period. Official flows either stagnated or declined. As a result their relative significance in global capital flows dwindled. In their place, private capital flows became the major source of external finance for a good number of emerging market economies. FDI became an important and dependable source of finance for the emerging markets and other middle-income economies during the decade of the 1980s and 1990s. Portfolio investment in stocks and bond markets also increased substantially. Global institutional investors found this channel of investment functional and profitable. Mutual funds, insurance companies, and pension funds channeled large amounts through portfolio investment into the emerging market economies. As financial globalization progressed, presence of international financial intermediaries has expanded considerably. This applies more to international commercial banks than to investment banks, insurance companies and mutual funds. It is incorrect to say that their global expansion has been uniform because this has occurred unevenly. International bond issuance activity by emerging market economies recorded a sharp spurt in 1993. Emerging market economies began using ADRs and GDRs for raising capital from the global capital markets in 1990 in a small way. Copyright © 2006 The Berkeley Electronic Press.

,Guidelines For Sound Design In Computer Games,"The inconsequential exploitation of sound in most computer games, both in extent and nature, contrasts with its prominence in our daily lives and with the kind of associations that have been explored in domains such as music and cinema. Sound design remains the craft of a talented minority and the unavailability of a public body of knowledge on the subject has greatly contributed to this state of affairs. This leads to a mix of alienation and best-judgment improvisation in the broader development community. A sensitivity to the potential of sound for the enrichment of the experience-with emphasis on game specifics-is, therefore, necessary. This study presents a contribution to the practice of sound design for computer games. An approach to intentional sound design, informed by multi-disciplinary interpretations of concepts including emotion, context, acoustic ecology, soundscape, resonance, and entrainment, is distilled into a set of design guidelines that holistically address the different sound layers. © 2011, IGI Global.",doi,10.4018/978-1-61692-828-5.ch017,Scopus,Game Sound Technology and Player Interaction: Concepts and Developments,"Alves V., Roque L.",2010,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Hci2 Framework:\ A Software Framework For Multimodal Human-Computer Interaction Systems,"This paper presents a novel software framework for the development and research in the area of multimodal human-computer interface (MHCI) systems. The proposed software framework, which is called the HCI2 Framework, is built upon publish/subscribe (P/S) architecture. It implements a shared-memory-based data transport protocol for message delivery and a TCP-based system management protocol. The latter ensures that the integrity of system structure is maintained at runtime. With the inclusion of bridging modules, the HCI2 Framework is interoperable with other software frameworks including Psyclone and ActiveMQ. In addition to the core communication middleware, we also present the integrated development environment (IDE) of the HCI2 Framework. It provides a complete graphical environment to support every step in a typical MHCI system development process, including module development, debugging, packaging, and management, as well as the whole system management and testing. The quantitative evaluation indicates that our framework outperforms other similar tools in terms of average message latency and maximum data throughput under a typical single PC scenario. To demonstrate HCI2 Framework's capabilities in integrating heterogeneous modules, we present several example modules working with a variety of hardware and software. We also present an example of a full system developed using the proposed HCI2 Framework, which is called the CamGame system and represents a computer game based on hand-held marker(s) and low-cost camera(s). © 2013 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TCYB.2013.2271563,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,"Shen J., Pantic M.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,"Health Outcomes Of Information System Use Lifestyles Among Adolescents: Videogame Addiction, Sleep Curtailment And Cardio-Metabolic Deficiencies","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Obesity is a rising problem among adolescents in modern societies; it results in long-term cardio-metabolic problems. Possible overlooked drivers of obesity and its consequent cardio-metabolic deficits include videogame addiction and the resulting curtailed sleep; both are growing problems among adolescents. The objective of this study is to examine possible associations among these concepts in adolescents, as a means to point to plausible interventions.METHODS: Data were collected from 94 adolescents who play videogames and are enrolled in outpatient clinics, using surveys, wearable sleep monitors (FitBit), physical exams, and blood tests at three points in time. These data were subjected to structural equation modeling (SEM) analyses and bootstrapping-based mediation testing procedures.RESULTS: Videogame addiction among adolescents was negatively associated with sleep duration (β = -0.24). Sleep duration was negatively associated with obesity (β = -0.30), which in turn was associated with elevated blood pressure (β = 0.26), low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (β = -0.18), high triglycerides (β = 0.61), and high insulin resistance (β = 0.39). The model explained 36.2% of the variation in sleep duration, 32.7% of the variation in obesity, and between 12.8% and 28.1% of the variation in cardio-metabolic indicators. Post-hoc analyses indicated that curtailed sleep is a possible full mediator of the association between videogame addiction, abdominal obesity and the associated cardio-metabolic deficits.CONCLUSION: The findings point to possible information systems use lifestyle-health links, which behooves researchers and practitioners to pay closer attention to possible adverse health outcomes of technology-related addictions. Interventions that target problematic video-gaming and sleep should be devised as a possible means for improving adolescents' long-term cardio-metabolic health.",doi,10.1371/journal.pone.0154764,Scopus,PloS one,"Turel O., Romashkin A., Morrison K.M.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,"Heart Rate And Oxygen Consumption During Mental Arithmetic, A Video Game, And Graded Exercise: Further Evidence Of Metabolically‐Exaggerated Cardiac Adjustments?","Heart rate, plus various metabolic and ventilatory indices, were monitored while 20 young male subjects were exposed to a video game and a stressful mental arithmetic task. Measurements were also made while subjects undertook graded isotonic exercise. All measures changed as a function of psychological challenge, and during exercise physiological activity increased as an orderly function of workload. For each subject, heart rate was plotted against oxygen consumption over the various exercise loads. For the majority of subjects the analogous data points for the video game and mental arithmetic lay reliably above the exercise heart rate‐oxygen consumption regression lines. When these regression lines were used to predict heart rate values during psychological challenge, the predicted values were significantly less than the values actually recorded for both tasks; although the discrepancy between predicted and actual values was on average greater with mental arithmetic, the difference was not statistically reliable. Pre‐stressor baseline conditions were also associated with heart rate levels greater than predicted, albeit to a lesser extent. Finally, while both stressors produced heart rate adjustments additional to expectancies, inter‐task consistency was low. Copyright © 1985, Wiley Blackwell.

,Heart Rate And Perceived Exertion During Self-Selected Intensities For Exergaming Compared To Traditional Exercise In College-Age Participants,"Exergames may be useful for promoting physical activity in younger populations. Heart rate (HRs) responses and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) at selfselected intensities were compared in college-age participants during 2 modes of exergame activity vs. traditional exercise. Thirty-seven participants (men: 20, women: 17) completed 3 30-minute self-selected intensity trials: (a) video game interactive bicycle ergometer (GB) (CatEye GB300), (b) interactive video dance game (Dance Dance Revolution [DDR]), and (c) traditional cycle ergometer (CE) while watching television. Mean HR, peak HR (PkHR), and minutes above target HR (THR) were significantly higher for GB (144 ± 22 b·min-1 [57% HR reserve (HRR)], 161 ± 23 b·min-1, and 22.5 ± 11.1 minutes) than for DDR (119 ± 16 b·min-1 [37% HRR], 138 ± 20 b·min-1, and 11.2 ± 11.9 minutes) or for CE (126 ± 20 b·min-1 [42% HRR], 1446 24 b·min -1, and 14.2 ± 12.6 minutes). The RPE was significantly higher for GB (4.2 ± 1.5) and CE (3.8 ± 1.2) than for DDR (2.7 ± 1.3). Recovery HR (RecHR) (15 minutes postexercise) was significantly higher for GB (91 ± 14 b·min-1) than for DDR (80 ± 11 b·min-1) and neared significance vs. CE (84 ± 14 b·min-1, p = 0.059). No difference in PkHR, RecHR, or minutes above THR was observed between DDR and CE. Session RPE was significantly higher for GB (4.6 ± 1.7) and CE (4.1 ± 1.6) than for DDR (2.8 ± 1.5). All modes elicited extended proportions of time above THR; GB: 75%, DDR: 37%, and CE: 47%.

,Heart Rate Reactivity To Laboratory Tasks And In Two Daily Life Settings,"This study investigated relationships between laboratory task-related heart rate reactivity and heart rate responses in two daily life settings. The main purpose of the study was to demonstrate that the expression of heart rate reactivity during daily life depends on the nature of the daily life situation, or on subjective or behavioral responses in the daily life situation. Twenty-six healthy, male medical students completed one laboratory session consisting of pretask rest, reaction time, video game, and mental arithmetic conditions, and 2 day-long field study periods, during which subjects either worked as student physicians in a medical clinic or attended classroom lectures. After controlling for differences in daily life physical activity levels, (1) heart rate levels were significantly higher during clinic work periods, compared to classroom work periods and evenings of both days, (2) and heart rate responses to the tasks correlated significantly with minimum, mean, and maximum heart rate responses from the clinic work period, but not from the other field periods. Thus, individual differences in heart rate reactivity were found in one daily life situation, but not in another daily life situation. These results support the experimental hypothesis.",doi,10.1097/00006842-199405000-00015,Scopus,Psychosomatic Medicine,Pollak M.H.,1994,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Heart Rate Responses And Technical-Tactical Aspects Of Official 5-A-Side Youth Soccer Matches Played On Clay And Artificial Turf,"Using a randomized crossover design, this study aimed to compare the heart rate (HR) responses and match analysis parameters (i.e., type of action; the number of players involved in an action; the number of passes performed in a collective action; precision of the shots; lost balls; ball interceptions; dribblings; and tackles) of official 5-a-side youth male soccer matches played over 2 pitch surface (i.e., clay vs. artificial turf) conditions. Twenty-two young male soccer players (age 8.3 6 0.4 years) engaged in 2 consecutive 15-minute periods in each experimental condition. During the match, 53% of HR responses exceeded 85% of the individual HR peak. No difference emerged between both pitch surfaces and match periods for HR and match analysis indicators. The two 15-minute periods resulted in being appropriate for 8-year-old players, in resembling the intensity of play and the intermittent nature of adult soccer. The similar HR responses and technical-tactical patterns observed on the 2 surfaces indicate that youth match play is not affected by differences in pitch surface. To support the development of individual and team skills of young soccer players, coaches are advised to prioritize game knowledge based on divergent thinking and experience, rather than traditional teaching based on instructions. © 2012 National Strength and Conditioning Association.",doi,10.1519/JSC.0b013e31821854f2,Scopus,Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research,"Tessitore A., Perroni F., Meeusen R., Cortis C., Lupo C., Capranica L.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Hedonic Coalition Formation For Distributed Task Allocation Among Wireless Agents,"Autonomous wireless agents such as unmanned aerial vehicles, mobile base stations, cognitive devices, or self-operating wireless nodes present a great potential for deployment in next-generation wireless networks. While current literature has been mainly focused on the use of agents within robotics or software engineering applications, this paper proposes a novel usage model for self-organizing agents suitable for wireless communication networks. In the proposed model, a number of agents are required to collect data from several arbitrarily located tasks. Each task represents a queue of packets that require collection and subsequent wireless transmission by the agents to a central receiver. The problem is modeled as a hedonic coalition formation game between the agents and the tasks that interact in order to form disjoint coalitions. Each formed coalition is modeled as a polling system consisting of a number of agents, designated as collectors, which move between the different tasks present in the coalition, collect and transmit the packets. Within each coalition, some agents might also take the role of a relay for improving the packet success rate of the transmission. The proposed hedonic coalition formation algorithm allows the tasks and the agents to take distributed decisions to join or leave a coalition, based on the achieved benefit in terms of effective throughput, and the cost in terms of polling system delay. As a result of these decisions, the agents and tasks structure themselves into independent disjoint coalitions which constitute a Nash-stable network partition. Moreover, the proposed coalition formation algorithm allows the agents and tasks to adapt the topology to environmental changes, such as the arrival of new tasks, the removal of existing tasks, or the mobility of the tasks. Simulation results show how the proposed algorithm allows the agents and tasks to self-organize into independent coalitions, while improving the performance, in terms of average player (agent or task) payoff, of at least 30.26 percent (for a network of five agents with up to 25 tasks) relatively to a scheme that allocates nearby tasks equally among agents. © 2011 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TMC.2010.242,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,"Saad W., Han Z., Basar T., Debbah M., Hjorungnes A.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Hemispheric Consequences Of Success-Related Emotional States: Roles Of Arousal And Attention,"Three experiments employed a video game technique to investigate the influence of success-related emotional states on the detection of lateralized visual targets. Emotion was manipulated by means of success and failure feedback, while central and peripheral pretarget cues were used to assess arousal and attentional processes. Under neutral conditions involving no feedback, subjects showed a right visual field (RVF) advantage along with a phasic alerting effect (i.e., reaction times were faster to targets following cues at intermediate stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs)). When emotional value was added to the task, the RVF advantage increased following failure and decreased following success feedback. This effect peaked at intermediate SOAs, corresponding with the buildup of phasic arousal initiated by the cues. It was not influenced by the location of the pretarget cues, suggesting that attentional processes are not directly involved. These results are discussed in terms of recent models of hemispheric functioning during positive and negative emotional states. © 1989.",doi,10.1016/0278-2626(89)90021-3,Scopus,Brain and Cognition,Derryberry D.,1989,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,High Blood Pressure And Sedentary Behavior In Adolescents Are Associated Even After Controlling For Confounding Factors,"Objective. The aim of this study was to determine whether high blood pressure (HBP) is associated with sedentary behavior in young people even after controlling for potential confounders (gender, age, socioeconomic level, tobacco, alcohol, obesity and physical activity). Methods. In this epidemiological study, 1231 adolescents were evaluated. Blood pressure was measured with an oscillometric device and waist circumference with an inextensible tape. Sedentary behavior (watching television, computer use and playing video games) and physical activity were assessed by a questionnaire. We used mean and standard deviation to describe the statistical analysis, and the association between HBP and sedentary behavior was assessed by the chi-squared test. Binary logistic regression was used to observe the magnitude of association and cluster analyses (sedentary behavior and abdominal obesity; sedentary behavior and physical inactivity). Results. HBP was associated with sedentary behaviors [odds ratio (OR) = 2.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.41-3.96], even after controlling for various confounders (OR = 1.68, CI = 1.03-2.75). In cluster analysis the combination of sedentary behavior and elevated abdominal obesity contributed significantly to an increased likelihood of having HBP (OR = 13.51, CI 7.21-23.97). Conclusions. Sedentary behavior was associated with HBP, and excess fat in the abdominal region contributed to the modulation of this association. © 2015 Scandinavian Foundation for Cardiovascular Research.",doi,10.3109/08037051.2015.1070475,Scopus,Blood Pressure,"Christofaro D.G.D., De Andrade S.M., Cardoso J.R., Mesas A.E., Codogno J.S., Fernandes R.A.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia

,Hot Under The Collar: The Impact Of Heat On Game Play,"High temperatures have been documented to affect behavior in a variety of ways depending on the nature of the task. We extended this prior research by examining the effects of dynamically changing temperature on various aspects of performance in a video game task. In the span of approximately an hour, temperature was gradually increased, stayed constant for a period of time, and gradually decreased to baseline. The gaming task was a variation on one used to assess impulsivity in participants thus allowing the possibility of assessing the effects of temperature on impulsive choice. Rather than heat increasing impulsivity and thus decreasing wait times, participants showed increases in wait times as temperature increased which either suggests that participants were becoming more self-controlled under heat or that the documented negative impact of heat on motor functioning was dominating their performance. Importantly, the participant's sensitivity to the changing task requirements was not affected by changes in temperature. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",doi,10.1016/j.apergo.2016.08.035,Scopus,Applied Ergonomics,"Young M.E., McCoy A.W., Hutson J.P., Schlabach M., Eckels S.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,How Color Properties Can Be Used To Elicit Emotions In Video Games,"Classifying the many types of video games is difficult, as their genres and supports are different, but they all have in common that they seek the commitment of the player through exciting emotions and challenges. Since the income of the video game industry exceeds that of the film industry, the field of inducting emotions through video games and virtual environments is attracting more attention. Our theory, widely supported by substantial literature, is that the chromatic stimuli intensity, brightness, and saturation of a video game environment produce an emotional effect on players. We have observed a correlation between the RGB additives color spaces, HSV, HSL, and HSI components of video game images, presented to n=85 participants, and the emotional statements expressed in terms of arousal and valence, recovered in a subjective semantic questionnaire. Our results show a significant correlation between luminance, saturation, lightness, and the emotions of joy, sadness, fear, and serenity experienced by participants viewing 24 video game images. We also show strong correlations between the colorimetric diversity, saliency volume, and stimuli conspicuity and the emotions expressed by the players.

,How Do Engineering Attitudes Vary By Gender And Motivation? Attractiveness Of Outreach Science Exhibitions In Four Countries,"Outreach activities, like mobile science exhibitions, give opportunities to hands-on experiences in an attractive learning environment. We analysed attitudes, motivation and learning during a science exhibition visit, their relations to gender and future educational plans in Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Belgium (N = 1210 sixth-graders). Pupils' performance in a knowledge test improved after the visit. Autonomous motivation and attitudes towards science predicted situation motivation awakened in the science exhibition. Interestingly, the scientist attitude and the societal attitude were clearly separate dimensions. The third dimension was manifested in the engineering attitude typical for boys, who were keener on working with appliances, designing computer games and animations. Scientist and societal attitudes correlated positively and engineering attitude correlated negatively with the future educational plans of choosing the academic track in secondary education. The societal perspective on science was connected to above average achievement. In the follow-up test, these attitudes showed to be quite stable. © 2016 SEFI.",doi,10.1080/03043797.2015.1121466,Scopus,European Journal of Engineering Education,"Salmi H., Thuneberg H., Vainikainen M.-P.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Humor Engineering In Smart Environments,"Enjoyment is one of the positive emotions we expect to have when visiting environments that have been designed to provide us with entertainment experiences. However, enjoyment is also part of our daily life, whether we are at home, in our office environment, in public environments, or on the move from one environment to the other. Humor is important in our daily experiences. We ourselves and our daily conversational partners are expected to have a sense of humor. We cannot maintain friendly relationships with family members, friends, and colleagues without having this sense of humor. Humor is one of the most appreciated traits in human-human interaction. In this chapter, we investigate the possible role of humor in smart environments or, from an opposite perspective, how smart digital technology, its sensors, and actuators can help to introduce humorous situations and interactions in digitally enhanced physical worlds. With these words in mind, we discuss accidental, spontaneous, scripted, and staged humor. We will also draw upon humor as it appears nowadays in artificial physical environments, such as video game environments. Conclusions will be drawn about being able to include humorous interactions and about being able to participate in humorous activities in smart technology-supported environments and events. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",doi,10.1007/978-3-319-29433-9_3,Scopus,Emotional Engineering Volume 4,Nijholt A.,2016,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Immersive Journalism: Immersive Virtual Reality For The First-Person Experience Of News,"This paper introduces the concept and discusses the implications of immersive journalism, which is the production of news in a form in which people can gain firstperson experiences of the events or situation described in news stories. The fundamental idea of immersive journalism is to allow the participant, typically represented as a digital avatar, to actually enter a virtually recreated scenario representing the news story. The sense of presence obtained through an immersive system (whether a Cave or head-tracked head-mounted displays [HMD] and online virtual worlds, such as video games and online virtual worlds) affords the participant unprecedented access to the sights and sounds, and possibly feelings and emotions, that accompany the news. This paper surveys current approaches to immersive journalism and the theoretical background supporting claims regarding avatar experience in immersive systems. We also provide a specific demonstration: Giving participants the experience of being in an interrogation room in an offshore prison. By both describing current approaches and demonstrating an immersive journalism experience, we open a new avenue for research into how presence can be utilized in the field of news and nonfiction. © 2010 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",doi,10.1162/PRES_a_00005,Scopus,Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments,"de la Peña N., Weil P., Llobera J., Giannopoulos E., Pomés A., Spanlang B., Friedman D., Sanchez-Vives M.V., Slater M.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Impact Of Videogame Playing On Glucose Metabolism In Children With Type 1 Diabetes,"Time spent playing videogames (VG) occupies a continually increasing part of children's leisure time. They can generate an important state of excitation, representing a form of mental and physical stress. This pilot study aimed to assess whether VG influences glycemic balance in children with type 1 diabetes. Twelve children with type 1 diabetes were subjected to two distinct tests at a few weeks interval: (i) a 60-min VG session followed by a 60-min rest period and (ii) a 60-min reading session followed by a 60-min rest period. Heart rate, blood pressure, glycemia, epinephrine (E), norepinephrine (NE), cortisol (F), and growth hormone (GH) were measured at 30 min intervals from -60 to +120 min. Non-parametric Wilcoxon tests for paired data were performed on Δ-values computed from baseline (0 min). Rise in heart rate (p = 0.05) and NE increase (p = 0.03) were shown to be significantly higher during the VG session when compared to the reading session and a significant difference of Δ-glycemic values was measured between the respective rest periods. This pilot study suggests that VG playing could induce a state of excitation sufficient to activate the sympathetic system and alter the course of glycemia. Dietary and insulin dose recommendations may be needed to better control glycemic excursion in children playing VG. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.",doi,10.1111/j.1399-5448.2011.00770.x,Scopus,Pediatric Diabetes,"Phan-Hug F., Thurneysen E., Theintz G., Ruffieux C., Grouzmann E.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Impaired Social Decision Making In Patients With Major Depressive Disorder,"Background: Abnormal decision-making processes have been observed in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). However, it is unresolved whether MDD patients show abnormalities in decision making in a social interaction context, in which decisions have actual influences on both the self-interests of the decision makers per se and those of their partners.Methods: Using a well-studied ultimatum game (UG), which is frequently used to investigate social interaction behavior, we examined whether MDD can be associated with abnormalities in social decision-making behavior by comparing the acceptance rates of MDD patients (N = 14) with those of normal controls (N = 19).Results: The acceptance rates of the patients were lower than those of the normal controls. Additionally, unfair proposals were accepted at similar rates from computer partners and human partners in the MDD patients, unlike the acceptance rates in the normal controls, who were able to discriminatively treat unfair proposals from computer partners and human partners.Conclusions: Depressed patients show abnormal decision-making behavior in a social interaction context. Several possible explanations, such as increased sensitivity to fairness, negative emotional state and disturbed affective cognition, have been proposed to account for the abnormal social decision-making behavior in patients with MDD. This aberrant social decision-making behavior may provide a new perspective in the search to find biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of MDD. © 2014 Wang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",doi,10.1186/1471-244X-14-18,Scopus,BMC Psychiatry,"Wang Y., Zhou Y., Li S., Wang P., Wu G.-W., Liu Z.-N.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Impaired Stress-Induced Pressure Natriuresis Is Related To Left Ventricle Structure In Blacks,"The mechanisms through which stress may contribute to the racial difference in the prevalence of essential hypertension and associated target organ damage remain unclear. This study examined differences in stress-induced pressure natriuresis in 69 black and 52 white normotensives age 14 to 27 years, all with a positive family history of hypertension. Urine samples for sodium excretion were collected before and after a series of tasks (video game challenge, forehead cold stimulation). The average blood pressure across the 2 tasks and the average increase in blood pressure to the 2 tasks were calculated. Blacks had higher mean systolic (131 ± 12 versus 126 ± 12 mm Hg, P<0.02) and diastolic (77 ± 8 versus 72 ± 9 mm Hg, P<0.001) blood pressure and a greater average change in systolic blood pressure (15 ± 9 versus 11 ± 7 mm Hg, P<0.04). This was associated with a smaller change in sodium excretion (2 ± 6 versus 7 ± 10 mEq/h, P<0.002). The change in sodium excretion was related to the change in systolic (r=0.31, P<0.03) and diastolic (r=0.27, P<0.05) blood pressure in whites but not in blacks. Relative wall thickness was greater in blacks (0.31 ± 0.04 versus 0.29 ± 0.03, P<0.002). In conclusion, impaired stress-induced pressure natriuresis in blacks may contribute to racial differences in essential hypertension and its sequelae.",doi,10.1161/01.HYP.0000013735.85681.74,Scopus,Hypertension,"Harshfield G.A., Treiber F.A., Davis H., Kapuku G.K.",2002,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Implantable Cardiovascular Sensors And Computers: Interventional Heart Failure Strategies,"Despite evidence-basedmedical and pharmacologic advances themanagement of heart failure remains challenging, whether in the ambulatory setting where daily weight monitoring has failed, or in the inpatient setting where readmission rates and morbidity remains high. There is an urgent need to develop strategies to reduce hospitalizations and readmission rates for heart failure in general. There may be a shift in the paradigm with respect to the treatment of heart failure, which may usher in an era of invasive heart failure therapies and specialists.

,Implementing Artificial Intelligence: A Generic Approach With Software Support [Tehisintellekti Rakendus: Üldine Lähenemine Koos Tarkvaratoega],"In computer games, one of the eminent trends is to create large virtual worlds with numerous non-player characters. Usually their artificial intelligence (AI) is implemented by scripting, which can be a burden for the application developers involved. This paper suggests an approach facilitating designing AI functionalities and striving to reduce, via software tool support, the amount of hand-written AI script code needed. Our approach is suitable for, e.g., creating autonomous agents with personal characteristics, capable of behaving in a natural manner. For instance, the goal-oriented agent paradigm can be applied easily with the approach. The definitions needed are written using a script language. Therefore, the agent configurations can be tested rapidly. We have extended an existing AI environment and created a script framework for implementing general-purpose AIs. Moreover, we have implemented software tools capable of generating script code for helping in the AI structure design and for simplifying the actual code-writing task. For demonstrating the applicability of our approach, three example scenarios specialized from the framework are presented.",doi,10.3176/proc.2013.1.04,Scopus,Proceedings of the Estonian Academy of Sciences,"Heinimäki T.J., Vanhatupa J.-M.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Improving Game Bot Behaviours Through Timed Emotional Intelligence,"The video game industry is a very active economic sector focusing on the design and development of entertainment applications. In this sector, different enterprises compete to design innovative video games that exploit physical and emotional capabilities of video gamers in order to achieve high levels of realism. From this point of view, video games research should be enhanced by introducing: (1) novel methodologies for modeling emotions that depict the behaviour of different characters populating a virtual environment, and (2) some abstraction technologies useful to ""move"" this emotional intelligence on different game platforms without additional efforts. In this paper, innovative computational intelligence techniques, like the Timed Automata based Fuzzy Controllers, have been hybridized with emotional representation methodologies in order to provide game bots with human-like capabilities and, as a consequence, improve the realism of game under design. In order to allow different competitors to exploit our ""emotional engine"" on different hardware platforms, the Fuzzy Markup Language (FML) has been chosen to be the main technology for designing and implementing the bots behaviour. As shown in a case study based on Unreal Tournament 2004, the game bots exploiting our approach provide a more human-likeness behaviour if compared with simple finite state automaton based bots. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

,Increased Reward In Ankle Robotics Training Enhances Motor Control And Cortical Efficiency In Stroke,"Robotics is rapidly emerging as a viable approach to enhance motor recovery after disabling stroke. Current principles of cognitive motor learning recognize a positive relationship between reward and motor learning. Yet no prior studies have established explicitly whether reward improves the rate or efficacy of robotics-assisted rehabilitation or produces neurophysiologic adaptations associated with motor learning. We conducted a 3 wk, 9-session clinical pilot with 10 people with chronic hemiparetic stroke, randomly assigned to train with an impedance- controlled ankle robot (anklebot) under either high reward (HR) or low reward conditions. The 1 h training sessions entailed playing a seated video game by moving the paretic ankle to hit moving onscreen targets with the anklebot only providing assistance as needed. Assessments included paretic ankle motor control, learning curves, electroencephalograpy (EEG) coherence and spectral power during unassisted trials, and gait function. While both groups exhibited changes in EEG, the HR group had faster learning curves (p = 0.05), smoother movements (p </= 0.05), reduced contralesional-frontoparietal coherence (p </= 0.05), and reduced left-temporal spectral power (p </= 0.05). Gait analyses revealed an increase in nonparetic step length (p = 0.05) in the HR group only. These results suggest that combining explicit rewards with novel anklebot training may accelerate motor learning for restoring mobility.",doi,10.1682/JRRD.2013.02.0050,Scopus,Journal of Rehabilitation Research and Development,"Goodman R.N., Rietschel J.C., Roy A., Jung B.C., Diaz J., Macko R.F., Forrester L.W.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Inexpensive Spatial Position System For The Automation Of Inspection With Mobile Robots,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop a wireless positioning system. The automation of non-destructive testing (NDT) of large and complex geometry structures such as aircraft wings and fuselage is prohibitively expensive, though automation promises to improve on manual ultrasound testing. One inexpensive way to achieve automation is by using a small wall-climbing mobile robot to move a single ultrasound probe over the surface through a scanning trajectory defined by a qualified procedure. However, the problem is to guide the robot though the trajectory and know whether it has followed it accurately to confirm that the qualified procedure has been carried out.Design/methodology/approach - The approach is to use sophisticated bulk electronics developed for game playing in combination with MATLAB to develop a wireless positioning system.Findings - The paper describes the development of an inexpensive wireless system comprising an optical spatial positioning system and inertial measurement unit that relates the 3D location of an NDT probe carried by a mobile robot to a computer-aided drawing (CAD) representation of the test structure in a MATLAB environment. The probe is located to an accuracy of - 2 mm at distances of 5 m.Research limitations/implications - Positioning range is limited to 5 m. Further development is required to increase this range.Practical implications - The wireless system is used to develop tools to guide the robot remotely to follow a desired scanning trajectory, obtain feedback about the actual trajectory executed by the robot, know exactly where an ultrasound pulse echo was captured, map identified defects on the CAD and relate them to the real test object.Originality/value - An inexpensive spatial positioning system with sufficient accuracy for automated NDT purposes. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",doi,10.1108/IR-09-2014-0386,Scopus,Industrial Robot,"Al Rashed M.A., Sattar T.P.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Influence Of Physical Activity And Screen Time On The Retinal Microvasculature In Young Children,"Objective- It is not clear whether physical activity and sedentary behavior affect retinal microvascular caliber. We investigated associations among physical activity (outdoor and indoor sporting activities), sedentary behaviors (including screen time, television [TV] viewing, and computer and videogame usage), and retinal microvascular caliber in schoolchildren. Methods and Results- Six-year-old students (1765/2238) from a random cluster sample of 34 Sydney schools were examined. Parents completed questionnaires about physical and sedentary activities. Retinal images were taken, and retinal vessel caliber was quantified. After adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, eye color, axial length, body mass index, birth weight, and mean arterial blood pressure, children who spent more time in outdoor sporting activities (in the highest tertile of activity) had 2.2 μm (95% CI 0.65 to 3.71) wider mean retinal arteriolar caliber than those in the lowest tertile (Ptrend=0.004). Increasing quartiles of time spent watching TV were associated with narrower mean retinal arteriolar caliber 2.3 μm (95% CI 0.73 to 3.92), P trend=0.003. Conclusion- These data suggest that physical activity could have a beneficial influence, whereas screen time has a potential adverse influence on retinal microvascular structure. The magnitude of arteriolar narrowing associated with each hour daily of TV viewing is similar to that associated with a 10-mm Hg increase in systolic blood pressure in children.

,Integration Of Fire Simulation And Structural Analysis For Safety Evaluation Of Gymnasiums-With A Case Study Of Gymnasium For Olympic Games In 2008,"In order to be safely used in the 2008 Olympic Games, the currently existing gymnasiums should be taken for evaluating their safety of utilization. As the structural analysis and fire simulation have been developed to work separately in previous works, the normal loads and fire actions have not been able to be taken into account together. This paper presents a newly developed integrated system-SFSAS, for both of structural analysis and fire simulation. The computer model of a gymnasium can be used for both structural analysis and fire simulation in the system. Based on the structural analysis under temperature loads due to a fire that is designed according to the risk analysis, the fire protection degree for the components in a structure can be quantitated. In this paper, the solutions as well as a case study are presented and discussed in details. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

,Interaction Between Emotional State And Learning Underlies Mood Instability,"Intuitively, good and bad outcomes affect our emotional state, but whether the emotional state feeds back onto the perception of outcomes remains unknown. Here, we use behaviour and functional neuroimaging of human participants to investigate this bidirectional interaction, by comparing the evaluation of slot machines played before and after an emotion-impacting wheel-of-fortune draw. Results indicate that self-reported mood instability is associated with a positive-feedback effect of emotional state on the perception of outcomes. We then use theoretical simulations to demonstrate that such positive feedback would result in mood destabilization. Taken together, our results suggest that the interaction between emotional state and learning may play a significant role in the emergence of mood instability. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

,Interference Competition And High Temperatures Reduce The Virulence Of Fig Wasps And Stabilize A Fig-Wasp Mutualism,"Fig trees are pollinated by fig wasps, which also oviposit in female flowers. The wasp larvae gall and eat developing seeds. Although fig trees benefit from allowing wasps to oviposit, because the wasp offspring disperse pollen, figs must prevent wasps from ovipositing in all flowers, or seed production would cease, and the mutualism would go extinct. In Ficus racemosa, we find that syconia ('figs') that have few foundresses (ovipositing wasps) are underexploited in the summer (few seeds, few galls, many empty ovules) and are overexploited in the winter (few seeds, many galls, few empty ovules). Conversely, syconia with many foundresses produce intermediate numbers of galls and seeds, regardless of season. We use experiments to explain these patterns, and thus, to explain how this mutualism is maintained. In the hot summer, wasps suffer short lifespans and therefore fail to oviposit in many flowers. In contrast, cooler temperatures in the winter permit longer wasp lifespans, which in turn allows most flowers to be exploited by the wasps. However, even in winter, only in syconia that happen to have few foundresses are most flowers turned into galls. In syconia with higher numbers of foundresses, interference competition reduces foundress lifespans, which reduces the proportion of flowers that are galled. We further show that syconia encourage the entry of multiple foundresses by delaying ostiole closure. Taken together, these factors allow fig trees to reduce galling in the wasp-benign winter and boost galling (and pollination) in the wasp-stressing summer. Interference competition has been shown to reduce virulence in pathogenic bacteria. Our results show that interference also maintains cooperation in a classic, cooperative symbiosis, thus linking theories of virulence and mutualism. More generally, our results reveal how frequency-dependent population regulation can occur in the fig-wasp mutualism, and how a host species can 'set the rules of the game' to ensure mutualistic behavior in its symbionts. © 2009 Wang et al.",doi,10.1371/journal.pone.0007802,Scopus,PLoS ONE,"Wang R.-W., Ridley J., Sun B.-F., Zheng Q., Dunn D.W., Cook J., Shi L., Zhang Y.-P., Yu D.W.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia

,"Is It A Sense Of Autonomy, Control, Or Attachment? Exploring The Effects Of In-Game Customization On Game Enjoyment","This study presents a model linking character customization and game enjoyment. Two separate studies using different types of customization (functional vs. aesthetic) were employed to test two competing mechanisms that explain the effects of customizing in-game characters: feelings of autonomy and control - rooted in self-determination theory - and perceived attachment to game characters. Additionally, this study investigated how these two divergent mechanisms influence game enjoyment through immersion-related experiences. The findings showed that the feelings of autonomy and control are consistently stronger explanations for enjoyment, regardless of customization type. The results suggest that similar to other entertainment media, games can appeal to individuals through the senses of autonomy, control, and attachment to a character; the first two prove more critical. ©2015 Elsevier Ltd.

,Keep Your Opponents Close: Social Context Affects Eeg And Femg Linkage In A Turn-Based Computer Game,"In daily life, we often copy the gestures and expressions of those we communicate with, but recent evidence shows that such mimicry has a physiological counterpart: interaction elicits linkage, which is a concordance between the biological signals of those involved. To find out how the type of social interaction affects linkage, pairs of participants played a turn-based computer game in which the level of competition was systematically varied between cooperation and competition. Linkage in the beta and gamma frequency bands was observed in the EEG, especially when the participants played directly against each other. Emotional expression, measured using facial EMG, reflected this pattern, with the most competitive condition showing enhanced linkage over the facial muscle-regions involved in smiling. These effects were found to be related to self-reported social presence: linkage in positive emotional expression was associated with self-reported shared negative feelings. The observed effects confirmed the hypothesis that the social context affected the degree to which participants had similar reactions to their environment and consequently showed similar patterns of brain activity. We discuss the functional resemblance between linkage, as an indicator of a shared physiology and affect, and the well-known mirror neuron system, and how they relate to social functions like empathy. © 2013 Spapé et al.",doi,10.1371/journal.pone.0078795,Scopus,PLoS ONE,"Spapé M.M., Kivikangas J.M., Järvelä S., Kosunen I., Jacucci G., Ravaja N.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,"Kinematics, Dynamics, Biomechanics: Evolution Of Autonomy In Game Animation","The believeable portrayal of character performances is critical in engaging the immersed player in interactive entertainment. The story, the emotion and the relationship between the player and the world they are interacting within are hugely dependent on how appropriately the world's characters look, move and behave. We're concerned here with the character's motion; with next generation game consoles like Xbox360TM and Playstation®3 the graphical representation of characters will take a major step forward which places even more emphasis on the motion of the character. The behavior of the character is driven by story and design which are adapted to game context by the game's AI system. The motion of the characters populating the game's world, however, is evolving to an interesting blend of kinematics, dynamics, biomechanics and AI drivenmotion planning. Our goal here is to present the technologies involved in creating what are essentially character automata, emotionless and largely brainless character shells that nevertheless exhibit enough ""behavior"" to move as directed while adapting to the environment through sensing and actuating responses. This abstracts the complexities of low level motion control, dynamics, collision detection etc. and allows the game's artificial intelligence system to direct these characters at a higher level. While much research has already been conducted in this area and some great results have been published, we will present the particular issues that face game developers working on current and next generation consoles, and how these technologies may be integrated into game production pipelines so to facilitate the creation of character performances in games. The challenges posed by the limited memory and CPU bandwidth (though this is changing somewhat with next generation) and the challenges of integrating these solutions with current game design approaches leads to some interesting problems, some of which the industry has solutions for and some others which still remain largely unsolved. © The Eurographics Association and Blackwell Publishing 2005.",doi,10.1111/j.1467-8659.2005.00847.x,Scopus,Computer Graphics Forum,Collins S.,2005,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,"Knowing, Communicating, And Experiencing Through Body And Emotion","With new technologies such as body sensors, tangible interaction, haptics, interactive cloth, or small computing devices such as mobiles, we can move interaction from the desktop out into the world and onto our bodies. Likewise, with the boom of computer games, domestic digital technology use, and social communication tools, we have to consider designing for noninstrumental goals, beyond task completion. This has been picked up by human-computer interaction researchers in the so-called third wave of HCI, a movement that aims to design for experiences involving users emotionally, bodily, and providing for aesthetic experiences. We suggest that learning technologies could pick up on some of the results from the third wave of HCI, placing body and emotion more centrally into the communication and construction of knowledge. Designing for bodily interaction, emotional communication, or aesthetics is not trivial. In design work, a designer can only set the stage for certain experiences to happen, but in the end, it is the user who coconstructs the experience with or through the interaction. Based on our experiences of designing for bodily and emotional communication with others and with yourself, we will posit three postulates that might be helpful in designing for involving interaction: leaving 'surfaces' open for users to appropriate, building for users to recognize themselves socially, emotional or bodily through the interface, and avoiding reductionism. We also briefly discuss how bodily experiences may be of relevance to learning technologies. © 2008 IEEE",doi,10.1109/TLT.2009.3,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies,Höök K.,2008,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Lasting Impact Of Regret And Gratification On Resting Brain Activity And Its Relation To Depressive Traits,"Obtaining lower gains than rejected alternatives during decision making evokes feelings of regret, whereas higher gains elicit gratification. Although decision-related emotions produce lingering effects on mental state, neuroscience research has generally focused on transient brain responses to positive or negative events, but ignored more sustained consequences of emotional episodes on subsequent brain states. We investigated how spontaneous brain activity and functional connectivity at rest are modulated by postdecision regret and gratification in 18 healthy human subjects using a gambling task in fMRI. Differences between obtained and unobtained outcomes were manipulated parametrically to evoke different levels of regret or gratification. We investigated how individual personality traits related to depression and rumination affected these responses. Medial and ventral prefrontal areas differentially responded to favorable and unfavorable outcomes during the gambling period. More critically, during subsequent rest, rostral anterior and posterior cingulate cortex, ventral striatum, and insula showed parametric response to the gratification level of preceding outcomes. Functional coupling of posterior cingulate with striatum and amygdala was also enhanced during rest after high gratification. Regret produced distinct changes in connectivity of subgenual cingulate with orbitofrontal cortex and thalamus. Interestingly, individual differences in depressive traits and ruminations correlated with activity of the striatum after gratification and orbitofrontal cortex after regret, respectively. By revealing lingering effects of decision-related emotions on key nodes of resting state networks, our findings illuminate how such emotions may influence self-reflective processing and subsequent behavioral adjustment, but also highlight the malleability of resting networks in emotional contexts. © 2014 the authors.",doi,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0065-14.2014,Scopus,Journal of Neuroscience,"Eryilmaz H., Van De Ville D., Schwartz S., Vuilleumier P.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia

Gender differences were also found in participants' ratings of their motivations for playing videogames, their evaluations of particular characteristics of videogames, and their selection of their “most favorite” videogame. The differences between frequent and infrequent videogame players appeared to be limited to differences in the extent to which videogame playing is pursued and evaluated as a positive leisure activity, rather than reflecting broad differences in interest or personality.

,Loneliness And Social Behaviours In A Virtual Social Environment,"Feeling lonely motivates people to reconnect with others, but it can also trigger a vicious cycle of cognitions and behaviours that reinforces their loneliness. In this study, we examined the behavioural consequences of loneliness in a virtual social environment. A total of 176 participants navigated a character (protagonist) through a two-dimensional browser game and rated the character's loneliness multiple times during the game. In the first part of the game, another character is introduced as the protagonist's spouse. At one point, the spouse leaves for an undetermined period of time but later returns. Immediately before this separation, higher ascribed loneliness of the protagonist was associated with more frequent interactions with the spouse. After the reunion, however, higher ascribed loneliness was associated with less frequent interactions with the spouse. Ascribed loneliness was not significantly related to the frequency of interactions with others nor to the frequency of solitary activities. These patterns held after controlling for ascribed positive affect. Participants' levels of loneliness were related to the level of ascribed loneliness only when the spouse was present but not when the spouse was absent. In sum, these findings suggest that the conditions that trigger the vicious cycle of loneliness are person- and situation-specific. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",doi,10.1080/02699931.2014.922053,Scopus,Cognition and Emotion,"Luhmann M., Schönbrodt F.D., Hawkley L.C., Cacioppo J.T.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,"Longitudinal Relationship Of Parental Hypertension With Body Mass Index, Blood Pressure, And Cardiovascular Reactivity In Children","Objective: To investigate whether parental hypertension (HTN) affects children's body mass index (BMI) and cardiovascular reactivity (CVR) over time. Study design: A longitudinal study of 315 students (black: 23 females, 19 males; white: 142 females, 131 males) was conducted in the public schools of Obion County, Tennessee, between 1987 and 1992. BMI and BMI z scores were calculated. The CVR task was a series of video games (taking ∼10 minutes to play) given to the same students in their third-, fourth-, fifth-, seventh-, and eighth-grade years. CVR was defined as the change in blood pressure (Δ_BP) or heart rate (Δ_HR) between before playing and while playing the video game. Positive parental history of HTN (27.6%) was defined as at least 1 parent with HTN. Multivariable regression analyses were performed to estimate the effects of parental HTN on children's BMI and CVR over time. Results: Children with parental HTN had significant higher BMI, BMI z score, and R_BP than did children without parental HTN (BMI: 21.6 vs 19.9, P = .001; BMI z score: 1.6 vs 1.1, P = .003; R_SBP: 112.6 vs 110.4 mm Hg, P = .01; R_DBP 62.7 vs 60.6 mm Hg, P = .003) after adjustment for covariates. Increased CVR was observed in children with parental HTN compared with children without parental HTN but was statistically significant only for SBP (Δ_SBP: 17.2 vs 14.9 mm Hg; P = .01) after adjustment for covariates. Conclusions: Parental HTN independently predicted children's BMI, BMI z score, resting BP, and BP reactivity. © 2007 Mosby, Inc.

,Losses Disguised As Wins In Modern Multi-Line Video Slot Machines,"Aims: Players can wager on multiple lines of modern slot machines. When they spin and fail to gain any credits, the machine goes into a state of relative quiet. By contrast, when they spin and win, these spins are accompanied by reinforcing sights and sounds. Such reinforcement also occurs when the amount won is less than the spin wager. We sought to show that these 'losses disguised as wins', or LDWs, would be as arousing as wins, and more arousing than regular losses. Measurement and participants: We measured skin conductance response (SCR) amplitudes and heart-rate changes following wins, LDWs and losses for 40 novices playing a multi-line slot machine. Findings: SCR amplitudes were similar for wins and LDWs - both were significantly larger than for regular losses. Conclusions: For novice players, the reinforcing sights and sounds of the slot machine triggered arousal on wins, where the number of credits gained was greater than the spin wager, but also on 'losses disguised as wins' where the amount 'won' was less than the spin wager. Despite the fact that players lost money on these spins, these outcomes were more arousing than regular losses where no credits were gained. Although these findings involve novice players, the heightened arousal associated with these losses may have implications for the development of problem gambling, as arousal has been viewed as a key reinforcer in gambling behaviour. © 2010 Society for the Study of Addiction.",doi,10.1111/j.1360-0443.2010.03050.x,Scopus,Addiction,"Dixon M.J., Harrigan K.A., Sandhu R., Collins K., Fugelsang J.A.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Lower Cardiorespiratory Fitness Is Associated With More Time Spent Sedentary In First Episode Psychosis: A Pilot Study,"Patients with a psychotic disorder show lower cardiorespiratory fitness and higher mortality rates compared to healthy individuals. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to explore whether in patients with first-episode psychosis a low cardiorespiratory fitness is associated with decreased physical activity and increased sedentary levels. Twenty-nine outpatients (21 men; 22.8±5.1 years) performed a maximal exercise test to assess their maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max), wore a Senswear armband for five consecutive days and were assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Twenty-four patients (82.8%) scored below the normative cardiorespiratory values. The percent-predicted VO2max ranged from 47% to 109%. In a backward regression analysis, less time spent sedentary (min/day) was the only independent predictor of a higher VO2max. The model explained 28.0% of the variance in the VO2max-score. The current study indicates that future research should explore whether reducing sedentary behaviour (e.g. time spent napping or prolonged sitting during waking hours) might improve cardio-respiratory fitness levels. Interventions targeting recreational screen time (watching television, computer use, playing video games, etc.) or replacing passive to more active video games should be investigated. © 2017 Elsevier Ireland Ltd",doi,10.1016/j.psychres.2017.03.027,Scopus,Psychiatry Research,"Vancampfort D., De Hert M., Myin-Germeys I., van Winkel R., Firth J., Van Damme T., Probst M.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia

Journal Of Children And Media, 4(1), 18–38.","The study is on the effects of entertainment media on physiological and psychological indicators of stress. The concept of stress is considered to play a key role in the explanation of the effects of media use on aggression, academic performance, and health. Two types of media (television and video games) and violent versus nonviolent content were compared. Differential effects on physiological measures (heart rate [HR], heart rate variability [HRV], cortisol, salivary alpha-amylase [sAA]) and subjective experience were expected. Study participants consisted of 98 boys, aged 11 to 14. Physiological stress reactions were higher for video games than for television with regards to HR and HRV. Violent content had greater effects on physiological stress than nonviolent content, when measured in terms of sAA, cortisol, and HRV. Violent content, in general, was rated as being more stressful but also more enjoyable.

,Media Violence And The Self: The Impact Of Personalized Gaming Characters In Aggressive Video Games On Aggressive Behavior,"A recent development in video games is that players can design and personalize their own in-game characters. It was predicted that this innovation could lead to elevations in the intensity of the psychological effects of video games. The present study confirmed this hypothesis, revealing that participants who played an aggressive video game using their own, personalized character exhibited higher levels of aggressive behavior than participants who played an aggressive game with a non-personalized character. The aggressive behavior levels of the own-character players also exceeded those of individuals who played a non-aggressive game, regardless of whether or not they used a personalized character. Process analyses revealed that participants playing a violent video game with a personalized game character experienced more arousal and self-activation than they did when playing with an impersonal, default game character, which in turn increased aggressive responses. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

,Mental Hoop Diaries: Emotional Memories Of A College Basketball Game In Rival Fans,"The rivalry between the men's basketball teams of Duke University and the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill (UNC) is one of the most storied traditions in college sports. A subculture of students at each university form social bonds with fellow fans, develop expertise in college basketball rules, team statistics, and individual players, and self-identify as a member of a fan group. The present study capitalized on the high personal investment of these fans and the strong affective tenor of a Duke-UNC basketball game to examine the neural correlates of emotional memory retrieval for a complex sporting event. Male fans watched a competitive, archived game in a social setting. During a subsequent functional magnetic resonance imaging session, participants viewed video clips depicting individual plays of the game that ended with the ball being released toward the basket. For each play, participants recalled whether or not the shot went into the basket. Hemodynamic signal changes time locked to correct memory decisions were analyzed as a function of emotional intensity and valence, according to the fan's perspective. Results showed intensity-modulated retrieval activity in midline cortical structures, sensorimotor cortex, the striatum, and the medial temporal lobe, including the amygdala. Positively valent memories specifically recruited processing in dorsal frontoparietal regions, and additional activity in the insula and medial temporal lobe for positively valent shots recalled with high confidence. This novel paradigm reveals how brain regions implicated in emotion, memory retrieval, visuomotor imagery, and social cognition contribute to the recollection of specific plays in the mind of a sports fan.

,Metabolic Implications For The Mechanism Of Mitochondrial Endosymbiosis And Human Hereditary Disorders,"The endosymbiosis of proto-mitochondrial prokaryotes (PMP) into proto-eukaryotic host-cells was a major advance in eukaryotic evolution. The nature of the initial relationship remains the subject of controversy. Various conceptual models have been proposed, but none has definitive support. We construct a model of inter-species interactions based upon well-established respiratory pathways, describing the respective energy gain of host-cell and PMP resulting from varying levels of cooperation. The model demonstrates conflicting evolutionary strategies (""Prisoner's Dilemmas"") in the interspecies molecular transfers. Nevertheless, we show that coercion and iterated, multilevel selection on both species encourage endosymbiosis. Mutualism is favored if host-cells are significantly more effective than PMPs at gathering food. Otherwise, an unambiguous asymmetry between host-cell and PMP benefits implies that the initial relationship consisted of the host-cell deriving a reproductive advantage at the PMPs' expense-a cellular version of farming. Other initial relationships such as oxygen-detoxification mutualism and parasitism are not strongly supported by the model. We compare the model behavior with experiments on mutant human mitochondria and find the model predicts proliferation rates consistent with that data. We derive from the evolutionary dynamics counter-intuitive therapeutic targets for two human hereditary mitochondrial disorders that reflect the ongoing effect of short-term selection at the mitochondrial level. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

,Metabolic Responses Of Upper-Body Accelerometer-Controlled Video Games In Adults,"Historically, video games required little physical exertion, but new systems utilize handheld accelerometers that require upper-body movement. It is not fully understood if the metabolic workload while playing these games is sufficient to replace routine physical activity. The purpose of this study was to quantify metabolic workloads and estimate caloric expenditure while playing upper-body accelerometer-controlled and classic seated video games. Nineteen adults completed a peak oxygen consumption treadmill test followed by an experimental session where exercising metabolism and ventilation were measured while playing 3 video games: control (CON), low activity (LOW) and high activity (HI). Resting metabolic measures (REST) were also acquired. Caloric expenditure was estimated using the Weir equation. Mean oxygen consumption normalized to body weight for HI condition was greater than LOW, CON, and REST. Mean oxygen consumption normalized to body weight for LOW condition was also greater than CON and REST. Mean exercise intensities of oxygen consumption reserve for HI, LOW, and CON were 25.8% ± 5.1%, 6.4% ± 4.8%, and 0.8% ± 2.4%, respectively. Estimated caloric expenditure during the HI was significantly related to aerobic fitness, but not during other conditions. An active video game significantly elevated oxygen consumption and heart rate, but the increase was dependent on the type of game. The mean oxygen consumption reserve during the HI video game was below recommended international standards for moderate and vigorous activity. Although upper-body accelerometer-controlled video games provided a greater exercising stimulus than classic seated video games, these data suggest they should not replace routine moderate or vigorous exercise.",doi,10.1139/H10-058,Scopus,"Applied Physiology, Nutrition and Metabolism","Stroud L.C., Amonette W.E., Dupler T.L.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Methamphetamine Craving Induced In An Online Virtual Reality Environment,"The main aim of this study was to assess self-reported craving and physiological reactivity in a methamphetamine virtual reality (METH-VR) cue model created using Second Life, a freely available online gaming platform. Seventeen, non-treatment seeking, individuals that abuse methamphetamine (METH) completed this 1-day, outpatient, within-subjects study. Participants completed four test sessions: 1) METH-VR, 2) neutral-VR, 3) METH-video, and 4) neutral-video in a counterbalanced (Latin square) fashion. The participants provided subjective ratings of urges to use METH, mood, and physical state throughout each cue presentation. Measures of physiological reactivity (heart rate variability) were also collected during each cue presentation and at rest. The METH-VR condition elicited the greatest change in subjective reports of ""crave METH"", ""desire METH"", and ""want METH"" at all time points. The ""high craving"" participants displayed more high frequency cardiovascular activity while the ""low craving"" participants displayed more low frequency cardiovascular activity during the cue conditions, with the greatest difference seen during the METH-VR and METH-video cues. These findings reveal a physiological divergence between high and low craving METH abusers using heart rate variability, and demonstrate the usefulness of VR cues for eliciting subjective craving in METH abusers, as well as the effectiveness of a novel VR drug cue model created within an online virtual world. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.",doi,10.1016/j.pbb.2010.07.005,Scopus,Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior,"Culbertson C., Nicolas S., Zaharovits I., London E.D., La Garza R.D., Brody A.L., Newton T.F.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Modeling And Solving Planning Problems In Tabled Logic Programming: Experience From The Cave Diving Domain,"Action planning deals with the problem of finding a sequence of actions transferring the world from a given state to a desired (goal) state. This problem is important in various areas such as robotics, manufacturing, transportation, autonomic computing, computer games, etc. Action planning is a form of a reachability problem in a huge state space so it is critical to efficiently represent world states and actions (transitions between states). In this paper we present a modeling framework for planning problems based on tabled logic programming that exploits a planner module in the Picat language. In particular, we suggest techniques for structured representation of states and for including control knowledge in the description of actions. We demonstrate these techniques using the complex planning domain Cave Diving from the International Planning Competition. Experimentally, we show properties of the model for different search approaches and we compare the performance of the proposed approach with state-of-the-art automated planners. The focus of this paper is on providing guidelines for manual modeling of planning domains rather than on automated reformulation of models. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",doi,10.1016/j.scico.2017.04.007,Scopus,Science of Computer Programming,"Barták R., Chrpa L., Dovier A., Vodrážka J., Zhou N.-F.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Modeling Of Autonomous Problem Solving Process By Dynamic Construction Of Task Models In Multiple Tasks Environment,"Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) supposes a complex but single task to be solved. When a RL agent faces a task similar to a learned one, the agent must relearn the task from the beginning because it doesn't reuse the past learned results. This is the problem of quick action learning, which is the foundation of decision making in the real world. In this paper, we suppose agents that can solve a set of tasks similar to each other in a multiple tasks environment, where we encounter various problems one after another, and propose a technique of action learning that can quickly solve similar tasks by reusing previously learned knowledge. In our method, a model-based RL uses a task model constructed by combining primitive local predictors for predicting task and environmental dynamics. To evaluate the proposed method, we performed a computer simulation using a simple ping-pong game with variations. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Amid the rapid growth of this practice, normative questions have been under-explored. The primary goal of this article is to develop a normatively sophisticated and descriptively rich account for appropriately addressing major ethical considerations associated with gamification. The framework suggests that practitioners and designers should be precautious about, primarily, but not limited to, whether or not their use of gamification practices: (1) takes unfair advantage of workers (e.g., exploitation); (2) infringes any involved workers’ or customers’ autonomy (e.g., manipulation); (3) intentionally or unintentionally harms workers and other involved parties; or (4) has a negative effect on the moral character of involved parties. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",doi,10.1007/s10676-016-9401-5,Scopus,Ethics and Information Technology,"Kim T.W., Werbach K.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia

Violence varied among 2 versions of the game Mortal Kombat (MK1 = less violent, MK2 = more violent)—all other factors (graphics, sound) were held equal. As expected, increased game violence elicited greater CV reactivity and higher scores on hostility measures. Subjects who played MK1 or MK2 had higher heart rate reactivity than those who played billiards. Subjects who played MK2 showed greater systolic blood pressure reactivity than those who played MK1 or billiards. Finally, subjects who played MK2 scored higher on the hostility measures than those who played MK1, who in turn scored higher than those who played billiards. These results indicate that the level of videogame violence, not just violence per se, should be of concern to consumers.",doi,10.1111/j.1559-1816.1996.tb02740.x,anderson2010,Journal of Applied Social Psychology,"Ballard, M.

,Motivational And Situational Factors And The Relationship Between Testosterone Dynamics And Human Aggression During Competition,"Men engage in aggression at a cost to extrinsic reward, and this behaviour is associated with a rise in testosterone. To characterize the factors underlying aggression, men were assigned to one of the four experimental conditions of a computer game in which they were provoked (points were stolen from them or not) and/or received reward for aggression (received points for aggression or not). Men who were provoked but did not receive reward for aggression enjoyed the task the most, demonstrated an increase in salivary testosterone, and were more likely to choose a competitive versus non-competitive task than men in the other experimental conditions. Moreover, individual differences in aggressive behaviour among these men were positively correlated with the extent to which they enjoyed the task and with testosterone fluctuations. These results indicate that costly aggressive behaviour is intrinsically rewarding, perhaps to regulate future interactions, and that testosterone may be a physiological marker of such reward value. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",doi,10.1016/j.biopsycho.2010.04.001,Scopus,Biological Psychology,"Carré J.M., Gilchrist J.D., Morrissey M.D., McCormick C.M.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Movement-Based Sports Video Games: Investigating Motivation And Gaming Experience,"Video game consoles that enable gamers to use active body movements are becoming increasingly popular. Yet, little is known about the influence of movement on how gamers experience such games. This study takes an exploratory approach, using different data collection methods. A theory about the relationship between body movement and gaming experience emerges through the systematic collection and analysis of data obtained from interviews, questionnaires, video observations and a motion capture system. A Grounded Theory analysis of the interviews reveals two distinct motivations (to achieve and to relax) with which gamers approach such games, together with two corresponding movement control strategies. Four movement-specific items are found to influence immersion in movement-based interaction: natural control, mimicry of movements, proprioceptive feedback, and physical challenge. These results are verified by exploiting the movement patterns of gamers playing the Nintendo Wii Boxing game. This theory offers insights to game designers as to how to design future generations of movement-based games. Whilst a controller that leaves more space for appropriation can be appealing to a larger population, its design may fail to promote and motivate physical activity and emotional well-being. © 2009.",doi,10.1016/j.entcom.2009.09.004,Scopus,Entertainment Computing,"Pasch M., Bianchi-Berthouze N., van Dijk B., Nijholt A.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Multimodal Affect Modeling And Recognition For Empathic Robot Companions,"Affect recognition for socially perceptive robots relies on representative data. While many of the existing affective corpora and databases contain posed and decontextualized affective expressions, affect resources for designing an affect recognition system in naturalistic human-robot interaction (HRI) must include context-rich expressions that emerge in the same scenario of the final application. In this paper, we propose a context-based approach to the collection and modeling of representative data for building an affect-sensitive robotic game companion. To illustrate our approach we present the key features of the Inter-ACT (INTEracting with Robots-Affect Context Task) corpus, an affective and contextually rich multimodal video corpus containing affective expressions of children playing chess with an iCat robot. We show how this corpus can be successfully used to train a context-sensitive affect recognition system (a valence detector) for a robotic game companion. Finally, we demonstrate how the integration of the affect recognition system in a modular platform for adaptive HRI makes the interaction with the robot more engaging. © 2013 World Scientific Publishing Company.",doi,10.1142/S0219843613500102,Scopus,International Journal of Humanoid Robotics,"Castellano G., Leite I., Pereira A., Martinho C., Paiva A., McOwan P.W.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Negative Correlates Of Computer Game Play In Adolescents.,"There is some concern that playing computer games may be associated with social isolation, lowered self-esteem, and aggression among adolescents. Measures of these variables were included in a questionnaire completed by 204 year eight students at a North London comprehensive school. Principal components analysis of a scale to assess needs fulfilled by game play provided some support for the notion of ‘electronic friendship’ among boys, but there was no evidence that game play leads to social isolation. Play was not linked to self-esteem in girls, but a negative relationship was obtained between self-esteem and frequency of play in boys. However, self-esteem was not associated with total exposure to game play. Aggression scores were not related to the number of games with aggressive content named among three favourite games, but they were positively correlated with total exposure to game play. A multiple regression analysis revealed that sex and total game play exposure each accounted for a significant but small amount of the variance in aggression scores. The positive correlation between playing computer games and aggression provides some justification for further investigation of the causal hypothesis, and possible methodologies are discussed.",doi,10.1348/000712600161844,anderson2010,British Journal of Psychology,"Colwell, J., Payne, J.",2e3,NA,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Neural Substrates And Social Consequences Of Interpersonal Gratitude: Intention Matters,"Voluntary help during a time of need fosters interpersonal gratitude, which has positive social and personal consequences such as improved social relationships, increased reciprocity, and decreased distress. In a behavioral and a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment, participants played a multiround interactive game where they received pain stimulation. An anonymous partner interacted with the participants and either intentionally or unintentionally (i.e., determined by a computer program) bore part of the participants' pain. In each round, participants either evaluated their perceived pain intensity (behavioral experiment) or transferred an amount of money to the partner (fMRI experiment). Intentional (relative to unintentional) help led to lower experience of pain, higher reciprocity (money allocation), and increased interpersonal closeness toward the partner. fMRI revealed that for the most grateful condition (i.e., intentional help), value-related structures such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) showed the highest activation in response to the partner's decision, whereas the primary sensory area and the anterior insula exhibited the lowest activation at the pain delivery stage. Moreover, the vmPFC activation was predictive of the individual differences in reciprocal behavior, and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) activation was predictive of self-reported gratitude. Furthermore, using multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), we showed that the neural activation pattern in the septum/hypothalamus, an area associated with affiliative affect and social bonding, and value-related structures specifically and sensitively dissociated intentional help from unintentional help conditions. These findings contribute to our understanding of the psychological and neural substrates of the experience of interpersonal gratitude and the social consequences of this emotion. © 2016 American Psychological Association.",doi,10.1037/emo0000258,Scopus,Emotion,"Yu H., Cai Q., Shen B., Gao X., Zhou X.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia

,Nociceptive Flexion Reflex Thresholds And Pain During Rest And Computer Game Play In Patients With Hypertension And Individuals At Risk For Hypertension,"Supraspinal pain modulation may explain hypertensive hypoalgesia. We compared nociceptive flexion reflex (NFR) thresholds and pain during rest and computer game play in hypertensives and normotensives (Experiment 1) and normotensives with and without hypertensive parents (Experiment 2). The game was selected to modulate activity in pain pathways. NFR thresholds did not differ between groups during rest or game play. Pain ratings never differed between hypertensives and normotensives, whereas individuals with hypertensive parents reported less pain during the first two NFR assessments, compared to those without. NFR thresholds and pain were reduced by game play compared to rest. The failure of game play to differentially modulate NFR thresholds or associated pain reports between groups argues against enhanced supraspinal modulation of nociception and pain in hypertensives and those at increased risk for hypertension. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

,Non-Linear Dynamical System Approach To Behavior Modeling,"We present a dynamic systems approach to modeling and generating low-level behaviors for autonomous agents. Such behaviors include real-time target tracking and obstacle avoidance in time-varying environments. The novelty of the method lies on the integration of distinct non-linear dynamic systems to model the agent's interaction with the environment. An angular velocity control dynamic system guides the agent's direction angle, while another dynamic system selects the environmental input that will be used in the control system. The agent interacts with the environment through its knowledge of the position of stationary and moving objects. In our system agents automatically avoid stationary and moving obstacles to reach the desired target(s). This approach allows us to prove the stability conditions that result in a principled methodology for the computation of the system's dynamic parameters. We present a variety of real-time simulations that illustrate the power of our approach.",doi,10.1007/s003710050184,Scopus,Visual Computer,"Goldenstein S., Large E., Metaxas D.",1999,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Not All Digital Word Of Mouth Is Created Equal: Understanding The Respective Impact Of Consumer Reviews And Microblogs On New Product Success,"The expansion of the Internet and social media have triggered a differentiation of the word-of-mouth (WOM) concept, with consumer communication about brands and products now taking place in various settings and forms. Two important digital WOM types are microblogs and consumer reviews. To clarify their differential roles for product success, this study offers a theoretical framework of the influence of these two types of WOM, drawing from consumer information search theory and diffusion theory. The tests of the proposed framework use a longitudinal data set of video game sales and weekly information gathered from microblogs (i.e., over 13 million tweets from Twitter) and consumer reviews (i.e., more than 17,000 Amazon consumer reviews). Analyzing a system of equations provides evidence that the influence of microblogs and consumer reviews on new product success changes over time. Prior to launch, the volumes of microblogs and consumer reviews, together with advertising, represent primary sales drivers. After launch, the volume of microblogs is initially influential, then loses impact, whereas the impact of the volume of consumer reviews continues to grow.

In search of explanations for such behavior, it has been argued that at least some individuals have a general tendency to behave altruistically independent of profitability. In fact, a stable altruistic trait would be adaptive if it were recognizable. Then, altruists could choose each other in order to retain benefits through mutual cooperation. Previous research has shown that individuals can predict the degree of altruistic behavior of strangers by reading signs of emotions evoked in significant social decisions. However, the identification of benevolent emotional states is no guarantee of the existence of permanent altruistic traits, though permanent traits are the preferable criterion for selection of good interaction partners. In this study, we tested whether individuals are able to identify altruistic traits. Judges watched 20-s silent video clips of unacquainted target persons and were asked to estimate the behavior of these target persons in a money-sharing task. As the videotapes of the target persons had been recorded in a setting unrelated to altruistic behavior, the judges could not base their estimates on situational cues related to the money-sharing task but instead had to draw on stable signals of altruism. Estimates were significantly better than chance, indicating that individuals can identify permanent altruistic traits in others. As this mechanism raises opportunities for selective interactions between altruists, our findings are discussed with respect to their relevance for explaining the evolution of altruism through assortment. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

,"On Broadcasted Game Video Analysis: Event Detection, Highlight Detection, And Highlight Forecast","Efficient access to broadcasted computer game videos is urgently demanded due to the emergence of live streaming platforms. The popularity of game video streaming builds a big market showing commercial potentials and arising many technical challenges. In this work we facilitate efficient access from two aspects: event detection and highlight detection. By recognizing designated text displayed on screen when important events occur, we associate game events with time stamps, and accordingly develop an interface to facilitate direct access. For highlight detection, we jointly consider visual features, event features, and viewer’s behavior to construct two highlight models based on the psychophysiological approach and the data-driven approach, respectively. The concatenated highlights then enable compact game video presentation. To facilitate adaptive live streaming, a novel highlight forecast model is built to predict whether there will be a highlight in the next seconds, so that the streaming system can allocate more resource for more important segments on the fly. Comprehensive experiments based on various experimental settings demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed methods. We believe that this work is one of the early attempts on analyzing broadcasted computer game videos from the perspective of multimedia content analysis. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",doi,10.1007/s11042-016-3577-x,Scopus,Multimedia Tools and Applications,"Chu W.-T., Chou Y.-C.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,On Model Design For Simulation Of Collective Intelligence,"The study of collective intelligence (CI) systems is increasingly gaining interest in a variety of research and application domains. Those domains range from existing research areas such as computer networks and collective robotics to upcoming areas of agent-based and insect-based computing; also including applications on the internet and in games and movies. CI systems are complex by nature and (1) are effectively adaptive in uncertain and unknown environments, (2) can organise themselves autonomously, and (3) exhibit 'emergent' behaviour. Among others, multi-agent systems, complex adaptive systems, swarm intelligence and self-organising systems are considered to be such systems. The explosive wild growth of research studies of CI systems has not yet led to a systematic approach for model design of these kinds of systems. Although there have been recent efforts on the issue of system design (the complete design trajectory from identifying system requirements up to implementation), the problem of choosing and specifying a good model of a CI system is often done implicitly and sometimes even completely ignored. The aim of this article is to bring to the attention that model design is an essential as well as an integral part of system design. We present a constructive approach to systematically design, build and test models of CI systems. Because simulation is often used as a way to research CI systems, we particularly focus on models that can be used for simulation. Additionally, we show that it is not necessary to re-invent the wheel: here, we show how existing models and algorithms can be used for CI model design. The approach is illustrated by means of two example studies on a (semi-automated) multi-player game and collaborative robotics. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

,Openpsi: A Novel Computational Affective Model And Its Application In Video Games,"This paper introduces OpenPsi, a computational model for emotion generation and function by formalizing part of Dörner's PSI theory, which is an extensive psychological model of human brains, including knowledge representation, perception and bounded rationality. We also borrowed some technical ideas from MicroPsi, one of the concrete implementations of PSI theory by Joscha Bach. The proposed emotional model is then applied to control a virtual robot living in a game world inspired by Minecraft. Simulation experiments have been performed and evaluated for three different scenarios. The emergent emotions fit quite well with these circumstances. The dynamics of this affective model are also analyzed using Lewis's dynamic theory of emotions. Evidences of phase transitions suggested by Lewis are observed in simulations, including trigger, self-amplification and self-stabilization phases. These experiment results show that the proposed model is a quite promising approach of modeling both emotion emergence and dynamics. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

,Optoelectrothermic Control Of Highly Integrated Polymer-Based Mems Applied In An Artificial Skin,"A study was conducted to demonstrate a material-based approach of polymeric large-scale integrated microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), based on a stimuli-responsive polymer. It was demonstrated that the stimuli-responsive polymer acted as the active functional actuator. These devices provided a simple single-layer set-up to control of a large number of random elements in a simultaneous and individual manner. The generation of visual and physical artificial impressions of a surface was demonstrated using an imaging array system, called 'artificial skin'. The artificial skin was used for physical-auditory interaction with simulators and game engines by mapping computer-generated data. The study used a temperature-sensitive hydrogel of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) as the active polymer actuator. The actuator array unit was connected to 18 channels providing finely tunable control over the supply of swelling agent.",doi,10.1002/adma.200802737,Scopus,Advanced Materials,"Richter A., Paschew G.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Oscillatory Activity And Phase-Amplitude Coupling In The Human Medial Frontal Cortex During Decision Making,"Electroencephalogram oscillations recorded both within and over the medial frontal cortex have been linked to a range of cognitive functions, including positive and negative feedback processing. Medial frontal oscillatory characteristics during decision making remain largely unknown. Here, we examined oscillatory activity of the human medial frontal cortex recorded while subjects played a competitive decision-making game. Distinct patterns of power and cross-trial phase coherence in multiple frequency bands were observed during different decision-related processes (e.g., feedback anticipation vs. feedback processing). Decision and feedback processing were accompanied by a broadband increase in cross-trial phase coherence at around 220 msec, and dynamic fluctuations in power. Feedback anticipation was accompanied by a shift in the power spectrum from relatively lower (delta and theta) to higher (alpha and beta) power. Power and cross-trial phase coherence were greater following losses compared to wins in theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands, but were greater following wins compared to losses in the delta band. Finally, we found that oscillation power in alpha and beta frequency bands were synchronized with the phase of delta and theta oscillations (''phase-amplitude coupling''). This synchronization differed between losses and wins, suggesting that phase-amplitude coupling might reflect a mechanism of feedback valence coding in the medial frontal cortex. Our findings link medial frontal oscillations to decision making, with relations among activity in different frequency bands suggesting a phase-utilizing coding of feedback valence information. ©2008 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",doi,10.1162/jocn.2008.21020,Scopus,Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience,"Cohen M.X., Elger C.E., Fell J.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Oscillatory Brain Responses Evoked By Video Game Events: The Case Of Super Monkey Ball 2,"Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded while the subjects played a video game where the player had to steer a monkey into a goal while collecting bananas for extra points and had to avoid falling off the edge of the game board. Each of these three studied events evoked differential EEG oscillatory changes. Picking up bananas evoked decreased theta activation on central electrodes, decreased high alpha activation on frontal electrodes, and increased beta activation on frontal electrodes. Falling off the game board evoked decreased central theta activation and increased fronto-central beta activation. Reaching the goal evoked increased theta activation on parietal electrodes, increased low alpha activation on frontal electrodes, increased high alpha activation on frontal, central, and parietal electrodes, and increased beta activation on frontal and central electrodes. It is suggested that the EEG oscillations evoked by picking up bananas reflect increased cortical activation and arousal; the oscillations evoked by falling off the edge of the game board reflect motor functions; and the oscillations evoked by reaching the goal reflect a relaxed state. Thus, EEG may turn out to be a valuable tool when examining psychological responses to video game events. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",doi,10.1089/cpb.2006.9947,Scopus,Cyberpsychology and Behavior,"Salminen M., Ravaja N.",2007,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Pals In Power Armor: Attribution Of Human-Like Emotions To Video Game Characters In An Ingroup/Outgroup Situation,"Previous research has demonstrated the tendency for humans to anthropomorphize computers-that is, to react to computers as social actors, despite knowing that the computers are mere machines. In the present research, we examined the attribution of both primary (non-uniquely human) and secondary (human-like) emotions to ingroup (teammate) and outgroup (opponent) computer-controlled characters in a video game. We found that participants perceived the teammate character as experiencing more secondary emotions than the opponent character, but that they perceived the teammate and opponent character as experiencing equal levels of primary emotions. Thus, participants anthropomorphized the ingroup character to a greater extent than the outgroup character. These results imply that computers' ""emotions"" are treated with a similar ingroup/outgroup social regard as the emotions of actual humans. © Copyright 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",doi,10.1089/cyber.2012.0111,Scopus,"Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking","Besmann A., Rios K.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,"Parental History Of Hypertension, Menstrual Cycle Phase, And Cardiovascular Response To Stress","The present study examined whether inconsistent findings for elevated cardiovascular response to stress in female offspring of hypertensives might be a function of 1) lack of control for menstrual cycle phase, and 2) stressor type employed. Thirty healthy women (18-35 years), half of whom were offspring of hypertensives, were tested in both the luteal and follicular phases of the menstrual cycle. Order of testing was counterbalanced between subjects and cycle phase was confirmed by measurement of serum sex hormone levels. In each session, subjects were exposed to four tasks: the cold pressor test, interpersonal speech, shock-avoidance video-game, and reading. The most consistent menstrual cycle effect was for offspring of normotensives who exhibited higher diastolic blood pressure and state-anger responses to the speech task in the follicular compared with the luteal phase. Though menstrual cycle had no consistent effect on offspring of hypertensives, their luteal phase diastolic blood pressure and state-anger responses to the speech task were elevated compared with controls. Potential limitations of the observed familial differences in luteal phase response are discussed.",doi,10.1097/00006842-199401000-00008,Scopus,Psychosomatic Medicine,"Miller S.B., Sita A.",1994,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Perception Of Psychopathy And The Uncanny Valley In Virtual Characters,"Virtual characters with a realistic, human-like appearance are increasingly being used in video games and animation. However, increased realism does not necessarily imply increased acceptance and factors such as aberrant facial expression may evoke the Uncanny Valley phenomenon. In humans, personality traits such as anger, callousness, coldness, dominance, being unconcerned, and untrustworthiness are associated with psychopathy; a visual facial marker of this condition being a lack of visible response in the eye region to emotive situations. As such, the present study investigated if inadequate upper facial animation in human-like virtual characters evoked the uncanny due to a perception of psychopathic traits within a character. The results revealed that virtual characters that showed a lack of a startle response to a scream sound were regarded as most uncanny and perceptions of personality traits associated with psychopathy were a strong predictor of reported uncanniness but, that other negative personality traits not associated with psychopathy were not. The study presents possible psychological drivers of uncanniness to inform designers why a lack of detail in a character's upper face when portraying a startle response may evoke perception of specific negative personality traits in a character, to help control the uncanny in character design. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

,Perceptual Illusions And Military Realities: Results From A Computer-Simulated Arms Race,"Traditionally, the most common game-theoretic model of the nuclear arms race has been the Prisoner's Dilemma, in which participants are bound in conflict by the structure of the situation. Recent evidence suggests, however, that the nuclear arms race may be better approximated by a “Perceptual Dilemma” arising from discrepant perceptions of various outcome utilities. The present experiment compared the effects of two strategies, a matching strategy (called Status Quo) and a matching strategy preceded by unconditional cooperation (called Disarmament Initiatives), within the context of a Prisoner's Dilemma or a Perceptual Dilemma. Results indicated that: (a) the Status Quo strategy sustained competitive behavior, attitudes, and emotions in both the Prisoner's Dilemma and the Perceptual Dilemma; and (b) the Disarmament Initiatives strategy induced significantly more cooperation among subjects locked in a Perceptual Dilemma than those in a Prisoner's Dilemma. The limitations, extensions, and implications of these findings are discussed in terms of political action and future research. © 1987, Sage Publications.

,Performance Of Non-Cooperative Routing Over Parallel Non-Observable Queues,"Autonomic computing is emerging as a significant new approach to the design of computer services. Its goal is the development of services that are able to manage themselves with minimal direct human intervention, and, in particular, are able to sense their environment and to tune themselves to meet end-user needs. However, the impact on performance of the interaction between multiple uncoordinated self-optimizing services is not yet well understood. We present some recent results on a non-cooperative load-balancing game which help to better understand the result of this interaction. In this game, users generate jobs of different services, and the jobs have to be processed on one of the servers of a computing platform. Each service has its own dispatcher which probabilistically routes jobs to servers so as to minimize the mean processing cost of its own jobs. We first investigate the impact of heterogeneity in the amount of incoming traffic routed by dispatchers and present a result stating that, for a fixed amount of total incoming traffic, the worst-case overall performance occurs when each dispatcher routes the same amount of traffic. Using this result we then study the so-called Price of Anarchy (PoA), an oft-used worst-case measure of the inefficiency of non-cooperative decentralized architectures. We give explicit bounds on the PoA for cost functions representing the mean delay of jobs when the service discipline is PS or SRPT. These bounds indicate that significant performance degradations can result from the selfish behavior of self-optimizing services. In practice, though, the worst-case scenario may occur rarely, if at all. Some recent results suggest that for the game under consideration the PoA is an overly pessimistic measure that does not reflect the performance obtained in most instances of the problem. © Cambridge University Press 2016.",doi,10.1017/S0269964816000097,Scopus,Probability in the Engineering and Informational Sciences,Brun O.,2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Personalized Adaptive Control Of Training Load In Cardio-Exergames - A Feasibility Study,"Objective: This article presents a feasibility study of using an algorithm for an individual and adaptive control of training load in an ergometer-controlled exergame for aerobic training. An additional goal was to investigate the effects of the adaptive game on the players' motivation. Materials and Methods: A two-phase approach (calibration and exercise phase) was applied in a sample of 16 physically active adults. In the cardio-exergame ""LetterBird,"" the flight of a pigeon was controlled by the pedaling rate of a bike ergometer as input device. During the calibration phase the individual heart rate (HR) responses of the players were measured. In the exercise phase, these data were used to adjust the resistance of the ergometer using the proposed algorithm. The purpose of this algorithm was to induce an individually defined target HR and to keep it in a steady state. In order to establish a reference for further studies, the game experience was measured using the kids-Game Experience Questionnaire. Results: In 15 of 16 participants the actual HR reached the intended individual HR range within 10 minutes after onset of exercise. However, the induced HR initially exceeded the target HR in 13 participants, which made load adjustments necessary. The analysis of the kids-Game Experience Questionnaire confirmed the motivational effect of the exergame ""LetterBird."" Conclusions: The results confirm that the proposed algorithm for personalized HR control in the game ""LetterBird"" is feasible. Furthermore, the cardio-exergame ""LetterBird"" seems to have a substantial short-term motivating effect. © Copyright 2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",doi,10.1089/g4h.2014.0073,Scopus,Games for Health Journal,"Hoffmann K., Sportwiss D., Hardy S., Wiemeyer J., Göbel S.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,"Phases Of Functional, Near-Normoglycaemic Insulin Substitution: What Are Computers Good For In The Rehabilitation Process In Type I (Insulin-Dependent) Diabetes Mellitus?","We have divided the rehabilitation process in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus into the following four phases. The basic phase, the so-called 'phase 0', provides information about literature, different strategies of treatment and introduces the use of regular insulin as well as blood sugar self-monitoring. During the 'phase 1' (i.e. 'diabetes education common sense') all the initial information from 'phase 0' will be used practically and discussed in depth. After the patient's actual insulin need (U/24 h) has been estimated, initial algorithms for functional insulin use can be defined. And this is the turning point to 'phase 2' of the group rehabilitation process, the so-called education in functional insulin use. Initial algorithms should be understood as a preliminary answer to the patient's questions, 'What is my basal insulin need?', 'How much insulin do I need for a particular amount of carbohydrates?', and 'What is the hypothetical response of my blood glucose to a particular amount of insulin?'. These algorithms are going to be used and optimised now by the patient (under the supervision of the physician) during the so-called 'insulin games' (fasting or 24 h, experimental violation of traditional dietary rules, etc.) to demonstrate (1) how to influence actual glycaemia through immediate correction of blood sugar off blood sugar target (primary adjustment of insulin dosing), and (2) how to optimise algorithms for insulin use (secondary insulin adjustment) in future conditions of different insulin sensitivity. The 'phase 3' of individual teaching is an ongoing process of updating the patient's knowledge and practical skills. All these phases (0-3) usually require about 40-50 h of (group) teaching. Functional insulin substitution was proposed for 340 type I diabetic patients. The mean glycosilated haemoglobin decreased to the upper limit of normal range in out-patients under the condition of free diet and remains still in this range despite low frequency of acute complications (Diabetologia 30 (1987) 47-48; p < 0.0001 vs. initial values). Computers are used for experimental purposes in all these phases of the rehabilitation process: (1) for the initial (programmed) information ('phase 0'), (2) for estimation of initial algorithms ('phase 1'), (3) as a training computer in the blood sugar simulation process ('phase 2'), and (4) for statistical evaluation of out-patients' clinical data and for up-dating the patient's knowledge ('phase 3'), as an 'artificial diabetes counsellor'. However, computers are still not used by the patient on a routine basis at present. © 1990.",doi,10.1016/0169-2607(90)90115-P,Scopus,Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine,"Howorka K., Thoma H., Grillmayr H., Kitzler E.",1990,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,"Physical And Cognitive Stimulation Using An Exergame In Subjects With Normal Aging, Mild And Moderate Cognitive Impairment","Background: The use of Serious exerGames (SeG) as enriched environments (EE), which promotes cognitive simulation with physical activity in a positive emotional context, has been proposed to represent a powerful method to slow down the decline due to neurodegenerative diseases (ND), such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, so far, no SeG targeting EE has been tested in ND subjects. Objective: This study aimed at evaluating the usability and short-term training effects of X-Torp, an action SeG designed for elderly ND subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. Methods: X-Torp is a SeG played using the Microsoft® Kinect™. 10 ND subjects and 8 healthy elderly controls (HEC) were enrolled in a 1-month program with three training sessions per week. Usability was evaluated through game time, game performance, the aerobic intensity level reached, perceived emotions, and perceived usability. Results: All participants successfully completed the training program. ND subjects played less and had a lower game performance compared to HEC. During the sessions, ND subjects maintained a light intensity of aerobic activity, while HEC maintained a moderate intensity. Both groups experienced only positive emotions, and reported a 'moderate' to 'high' perceived competence, a 'moderate' game difficulty, and a 'high' interest in the game. Conclusion: Usability results suggest that X-Torp represents a usable EE for healthy subjects and persons with MCI and AD.

,Physical And Perceptual-Cognitive Demands Of Top-Class Refereeing In Association Football,"The aim of this study was to examine the physical and perceptual-cognitive demands imposed on UEFA top-class referees and assistant referees during the final round of the Euro 2000 Championship. To investigate the physical workload, the heart rates during matches were monitored by short-range radio telemetry and translated to different workloads expressed as a percentage of maximal heart rate. For measurement of the perceptual-cognitive workload, video-recordings of games were used to obtain the average number of observable decisions taken by a referee. On average, referees and assistant referees performed the matches at 85 ± 5% and 77 ± 7% of their maximal heart rate, respectively. Over the 31 games, the mean number of observable decisions was 137 (range 104-162), 64% of which were based on communication with the assistant referees and/or the fourth official. To optimize the physical preparation of top-class match officials, the results of this study support the application of intensive and intermittent training sessions, which should place priority on high-intensity aerobic stimuli. In addition, video training is discussed as an additional method for improving match officials' decision making.",doi,10.1080/02640410310001641502,Scopus,Journal of Sports Sciences,"Helsen W., Bultynck J.-B.",2004,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Physiologic Responses To Playing A Video Game,"The displacement of sports and other physical activities by television and video may contribute to the associations among television viewing, obesity, and reduced physical fitness. Because video games are widely played by children and adolescents, we assessed the metabolic and cardiovascular responses to video game playing. Heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen consumption were measured serially over 30 minutes in 32 males and females aged 16 to 25 years (mean±SEM, 20±1 years) while they played the “Ms PacMan” video game under standard laboratory conditions and compared with measurements made in a standing but inactive position. Playing the video game significantly increased heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and oxygen consumption. Energy expenditure increased from 6.08±0.24 kJ/min while the subjects stood inactive to 10.94±0.49 kJ/min while they played. The increase in metabolic rate and cardiovascular stimulation was similar in magnitude to mild-intensity exercise. © 1991, American Medical Association.

,Physiological And Psychophysiological Responses In Experienced Players While Playing Different Dance Exer-Games,"Abstract As exer-game technology is increasingly integrated into workout and rehabilitation programs, it is important to understand how physical exertion, hedonics, and game usability experiences affect the knowledgeable player. In a repeated measures experiment, seven experienced players played five popular dance exer-games on separate days. Exertion was measured using indirect calorimetry. Hedonic experience was measured using questions about engagement and game-flow. Platform and software usability was determined by questionnaire and percent time spent in non-play activities (menu interfaces, software loading). Mean MET levels ranged from 4.26 to 9.18 during gameplay, depending on the game. Player engagement and game-flow were closely related to MET activity. Usability scores were closely related to time spent in non-play activities. Games with increased MET levels and higher usability scores were reflected in higher engagement and game-flow scores. Degree of interface embodiment did not affect these outcomes. Based on these results, problems in usability are barriers to engagement. Designing games that provide a balance of challenge, immersion, and engagement is a difficult task. These results demonstrate the importance of examining players of varying skill levels in order to fully understand the interaction of physical exertion, platform usability and player engagement. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.chb.2015.04.047,Scopus,Computers in Human Behavior,"Bronner S., Pinsker R., Noah J.A.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Physiological And Skill Demands Of 'On-Side' And 'Off-Side' Games,"This study investigated the physiological and skill demands of 'on-side' and 'off-side' games in elite rugby league players. Sixteen male rugby league players participated in 'on-side' and 'off-side' games. Both small-sided games were played in a 40-× 40-m playing area. The 'off-side' game permitted players to have 3 'plays' while in possession of the ball. Players were permitted to pass backward or forward (to an 'off-side' player). The 'on-side' game also permitted players to have 3 'plays' while in possession of the ball. However, players were only permitted to pass backward to players in an 'on-side' position. Heart rate and movement patterns (via global positioning system) were recorded continuously throughout both games. Data were collected on the distance covered, number of high-acceleration and velocity efforts, and recovery between efforts. Video footage was also taken to track the performance of the players. Post hoc inspection of the footage was undertaken to count the number of possessions and the number and quality of disposals. In comparison to 'on-side' games, 'off-side' games had a greater number of involvements (""touches""), passes, and effective passes. However, the cognitive demands of 'on-side' games were greater than 'off-side' games. 'Off-side' games resulted in a greater total distance covered, greater distance covered in mild and moderate accelerations, and greater distance covered in low, moderate, and high-velocity efforts. There were also a greater number of short duration recovery periods between efforts in 'off-side' games. The results of this study demonstrate that 'off-side' games provide greater physiological and skill demands than 'on-side' games. 'Offside' games may provide a practical alternative to 'on-side' games for the development of skill and fitness in elite rugby league players. © 2010 National Strength and Conditioning Association.",doi,10.1519/JSC.0b013e3181e72731,Scopus,Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research,"Gabbett T.J., Jenkins D.G., Abernethy B.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia

Journal Of Experimental Social Psychology, 47(4), 849–852.","This research addresses flow theory according to which the compatibility of skills and task demands involved in an activity elicits flow experiences that render the activity intrinsically rewarding. Departing from correlational research, we applied experimental paradigms designed to test the impact of a skills-demands-compatibility on the emergence of flow in computerized tasks. On the one hand, the results from self-reports support the balance hypothesis and indicate that skills-demands-compatibility results in a pleasurable flow experience. On the other hand, the results also indicate that skills-demands-compatibility resulted in (a) reduced heart rate variability indicating enhanced mental workload, and (b) stress as indicated by relatively high levels of salivary cortisol.

,Physiological Correlates Of The Flow Experience During Computer Game Playing,"Flow is the subjective experience of effortless attention, reduced self-awareness, and enjoyment that typically occurs during optimal task performance. Previous studies have suggested that flow may be associated with a non-reciprocal coactivation of the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems and, on a cortical level, with a state of hypofrontality and implicit processing. Here, we test these hypotheses, using the computer game TETRIS as model task. The participants (n= 77) played TETRIS under three conditions that differed in difficulty (Easy < Optimal < Difficult). Cardiac and respiratory activities, and the average oxygenation changes of the prefrontal cortex were measured continuously with functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) during performance. The Optimal condition was characterized by the highest levels of state flow, positive affect, and effortless attention. The associations between self-reported psychological flow and physiological measures were investigated using a series of repeated measures linear mixed model analyses. The results showed that higher flow was associated with larger respiratory depth and lower LF. The higher respiratory depth during high flow is indicative of a more relaxed state with an increased parasympathetic activity, and thus provides partial support for the main hypotheses. There was no association between frontal cortical oxygenation and flow, even at liberal thresholds; i.e. we found no support that flow is related to a state of hypofrontality. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",doi,10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2015.05.001,Scopus,International Journal of Psychophysiology,"Harmat L., de Manzano T., Theorell T., Högman L., Fischer H., Ullén F.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Physiological Demands Of Water Polo Goalkeeping,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the physiological demands of water polo goalkeepers during competition and to examine whether the playing intensity of the goalkeeper decreases as the game time progresses. During eight official games the following measurements were performed on eight elite water polo goalkeepers: (1) video analysis of activities, (2) monitoring of blood lactate (BLa) and (3) continuous recording of heart rate (HR) responses. Mean HR of total mixed playing time, excluding breaks among quarters, was 134.3 ± 20.3 bpm for 36 (4 × 9) min of game duration. The large portion of the game (85.6%) was performed with a HR lower than 151.4 ± 2.7 bpm (82.1 ± 1.4% of HRpeak) an intensity corresponding to the players' anaerobic threshold (3.49 ± 0.60 mmol L-1). However, an important part of the game (14.4%) contained activities with sudden HR increases above the anaerobic threshold. Mean BLa accumulation at the end of each game period was 3.93 ± 1.64 mmol L-1. Individual lactate values varied from 2.0 to 8.3 mmol L-1. Goalkeeper exercise intensity reached its peak value (152.5 ± 10.1 bpm) whenever his team competed with one player less due to player exclusion. No significant differences were found in HR, BLa and the percentage of time spent in each of the activity categories between game periods. In conclusion, goalkeeper's game can be described as of intermittent nature with great variability in the intensity performed. The greater part of the game is associated with a low aerobic demand while an important part of the game contains activities with sudden HR increases above the anaerobic threshold implying also a considerable demand on anaerobic metabolism. The intensity of exercise of the goalkeeper does not differ from period to period. © 2007 Sports Medicine Australia.",doi,10.1016/j.jsams.2007.09.011,Scopus,Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport,Platanou T.,2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Physiological Mouse: Toward An Emotion-Aware Mouse,"Human-centered computing is rapidly becoming a major research direction as new developments in sensor technology make it increasingly feasible to obtain signals from human beings. At the same time, the pervasiveness of computing devices is also encouraging more research in human–computer interaction, especially in the direction of personalized and adaptive user interfaces. Among the various research issues, affective computing, or the ability of computers to understand and react according to what a user “feels,” has been gaining in importance. In order to recognize the human affect (feeling), computers rely on the analysis of signal inputs captured by a multitude of means. This paper proposes the use of human physiological signals as a new form of modality in determining human affects, in a non-intrusive manner. The principle of non-invasiveness is very important, since it imposes no extra burden on the user, which improves user accessibility and encourages user adoption. This goal is realized via the physiological mouse, as a first step toward the support of affective computing. The conventional mouse is converted with a small optical component for capturing user photoplethysmographic (PPG) signal. With the PPG signal, it is possible to compute and derive human physiological signals. A prototype of the physiological mouse was built and raw PPG readings measured. The accuracy of the approach was evaluated through empirical studies to determine human physiological signals from the mouse PPG data. Finally, pilot experiments to correlate human physiological signals with various modes of human–computer interaction, namely gaming and video watching, were conducted. The trend in physiological signals could be used as feedback to the computer system which in turn adapts to the needs or the mood of the user, for instance change the volume and the light intensity when watching a video or playing a game based on current user emotion. The authors argue that this research will provide a new dimension for multimodal affective computing research, and the pilot study has already shed some light toward this research goal. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",doi,10.1007/s10209-016-0469-9,Scopus,Universal Access in the Information Society,"Fu Y., Leong H.V., Ngai G., Huang M.X., Chan S.C.F.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,"Physiological, Movement And Technical Demands Of Centre-Wicket Battlezone, Traditional Net-Based Training And One-Day Cricket Matches: A Comparative Study Of Sub-Elite Cricket Players","This study compared physiological, physical and technical demands of Battlezone, traditional cricket training and one-day matches. Data were initially collected from 11 amateur, male cricket players (age: 22.2 ± 3.3 year, height: 1.82 ± 0.06 m body mass: 80.4 ± 9.8 kg) during four Battlezone and four traditional cricket training sessions encompassing different playing positions. Heart rate, blood lactate concentration, rating of perceived exertion and movement patterns of players were measured. Retrospective video analysis was performed to code for technical outcomes. Similar data were collected from 42 amateur, male cricket players (23.5 ± 4.7 year, 1.81 ± 0.07 m, 81.4 ± 11.4 kg) during one-day matches. Significant differences were found between Battlezone, traditional cricket training and one-day matches within each playing position. Specifically, Battlezone invoked the greatest physiological and physical demands from batsmen in comparison to traditional cricket training and one-day matches. However, the greatest technical demand for batsmen was observed during traditional cricket training. In regards to the other playing positions, a greater physiological, physical and technical demand was observed during Battlezone and traditional training than during one-day matches. These results suggest that the use of Battlezone and traditional cricket training provides players with a suitable training stimulus for replicating the physiological, physical and technical demands of one-day cricket. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",doi,10.1080/02640414.2013.861605,Scopus,Journal of Sports Sciences,"Vickery W., Dascombe B., Duffield R.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Pilot Development Of An Electronic Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease Quiz Game,"Objectives: Data suggest physicians poorly assess disease-specific literacy and transition readiness in pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).We piloted an electronic, interactive iPad quiz game that could be used in a clinical setting, with the aims of measuring IBD-related knowledge, and concomitant mood and quality of life (QOL) in a pediatric population. Methods: Two pediatric IBD clinics developed and tested 2 versions of ""Emma."" Patients between 10 and 18 years of age played Emma during an office visit. Each patient answered 12 randomly selected disease-related questions and 4 mood-related questions. Results: Sites 1 and 2 tested Emma v1 between May and August 2013. Emma v2 was tested from November 2013 to January 2014 and from September 2013 to January 2014. A total of 56 patients played Emma v1, whereas 60 played Emma v2. In Emma v2, 73.1% of questions were answered correctly. Patients recognized signs of IBD (88%), causes of diarrhea in addition to IBD (79.4%), and could define lactose intolerance (95.8%), but fewer patients understood serological testing used for disease monitoring (68%) or knew that magnetic resonance enterography did not involve radiation (22.9%). Patients tended to report good functioning in the areas of energy, mood, anxiety, and school-related QOL. Patients with Crohn disease, however, reported higher stress levels compared with patients with ulcerative colitis; older patients reported lower energy levels, and postsurgical patients reported lower QOL. Conclusions: The Emma iPad game has the potential to evaluate gaps in IBD knowledge, assess emotional functioning, and increase patient engagement as a transition tool in the clinical setting. © Copyright 2015 by ESPGHAN and NASPGHAN.

,Pilot Trial Of Spirometer Games For Airway Clearance Practice In Cystic Fibrosis,"BACKGROUND: Many children with cystic fibrosis (CF) adhere poorly to airway clearance techniques (ACTs), and would rather play video games that challenge their dexterity and visual tracking skills. We developed gaming technology that encourages forced expiratory maneuvers. OBJECTIVE: Following interviews regarding recreational activities and subjects' practice of ACTs, we conducted a pilot trial of spirometer games in 13 adolescents with CF, to test the hypothesis that games could increase subjects' engagement with forced expiratory breathing maneuvers and improve pulmonary function tests (PFTs). METHODS: After baseline PFTs, subjects were provided with digital spirometers and computers set up as ""game only"" or ""control"" devices. After the first of 2 periods (each &gt; 2 weeks), the computer was set-up for the alternate condition for period 2. The t test and non-parametric correlation analyses examined use, number of expiratory high flow events (HFEs), and change in PFTs, identifying trends at P &lt; 1, significance at P &lt; 05. RESULTS: Interviews disclosed minimal awareness of ACTs among our pediatric CF patients. Subjects used games and control software a similar percentage of days during the game (26%) and control periods (32%). There was a trend toward more minutes with the game versus control setup (P = 07), though HFE count did not differ between the 2 conditions (P = 71). Game play showed no overall effect on FEV1, though correlation analysis showed a modest relation between minutes of play and change in FEV1 from baseline (r = 0.50, P = 09). The game period showed a trend to increased vital capacity (P = 05). CONCLUSIONS: Spirometer games elicit forced expiratory breath maneuvers in pediatric CF patients. Improvement in PFTs may be due to improved test performance technique, though improved obstructive/restrictive lung function due to game play cannot be excluded. A formal clinical trial of this approach is planned. © 2012 Daedalus Enterprises.",doi,10.4187/respcare.01263,Scopus,Respiratory Care,"Bingham P.M., Lahiri T., Ashikaga T.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Plasma Endothelin-1 Release During Acute Stress: Role Of Ethnicity And Sex,"Objectives: The purposes of this study were to examine possible ethnic and sex differences in plasma ET-1 levels at rest and in response to acute stress and to examine relationships between ET-1 and vasoconstrictive-mediated BP reactivity to stress. Methods: Two hundred twenty-two adolescents (mean age = 18.5 ± 2.8 years; 130 [70 males] EAs and 92 [48 males] AAs) completed two stressors (video game, forehead cold). Hemodynamic measures and blood samples were collected at catheter insertion and before and immediately after the two stressors, separated by 20-minute rest periods. Results: AAs and males exhibited higher levels of SBP and DBP and of TPRI and ET-1 at each sampling point compared with EAs and females, respectively (p values < .001). AAs and males exhibited greater increases in SBP, TPRI, and ET-1 in response to each stressor (p values < .05). Intraindividual correlations between ET-1 and hemodynamic parameters revealed that most individuals exhibited a positive association between ET-1, BP, and TPRI. However, some individuals exhibited a negative association between ET-1 and the above-mentioned hemodynamics, suggesting a compensatory vasodilation mechanism. Conclusion: The findings demonstrate significant sex and ethnicity differences in stress-induced vasoconstrictive peptide release and support the hypothesis that these differences may be important in explaining the ethnicity and sex differences in the prevalence of cardiovascular disease.",doi,10.1097/01.PSY.0000021952.59258.1C,Scopus,Psychosomatic Medicine,"Treiber F.A., Kapuku G.K., Davis H., Pollock J.S., Pollock D.M.",2002,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,"Playing Tetris For Science Counter-Regulatory Affective Processing In A Motivationally ""Hot"" Context","We adapted the computer game TETRIS to investigate the process of affective-motivational counter-regulation, that is, attentional biases for emotional stimuli that are in opposition to the momentary motivational focus. Counter-regulation is seen as a mechanism which should prevent escalation and impulsivity, and it should help to avoid becoming ""locked up"" in affective-motivational states. Accordingly, for a negative outcome focus condition (i.e., risk of losing a current high score), we hypothesized greater interference by positive distractors that were included in the game, whereas for a positive outcome focus (i.e., chance to improve one's current high score), we hypothesized greater interference by negative distractors. Supporting our hypotheses, we found the predicted interactions between distractor valence and type of outcome focus. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

,"Pleasing Frowns, Disappointing Smiles: An Erp Investigation Of Counterempathy","The biological predisposition to resonate emotionally with another person is regarded as a critical aspect of social interaction. There are, however, situations in which the emotional response to others is discordant with their emotional experience. Using event-related potentials, the present study investigated the neural underpinnings of this phenomenon, termed "" counterempathy."" Participants played a card game under the belief that they were playing jointly with another player who sat in an adjoining room and whose smiles and frowns in response to winning or losing in the game they could observe on a computer screen. Depending upon the experimental setting, the other player's facial expressions conveyed either of two opposing values to the participant. In the empathic setting, his emotional expressions were congruent with the participant's outcome (win or loss), whereas in the counterempathic setting, they indicated incongruent outcomes. Results revealed a reversed pattern of brain responses to facial expressions between congruent and incongruent conditions at ~170 ms (N170) over the temporal cortex. That is, N170 was sensitive to frowns in the congruent condition and to smiles in the incongruent condition, both indicating losses for the participant. Furthermore, frowns in the incongruent condition yielded larger medial frontal negativity (MFN) over the medial prefrontal cortex, which correlated with the subjective pleasantness about one's own winning in the incongruent condition. These findings demonstrate that (1) counterempathic responses are associated with modulation of early sensory processing of emotional cues, (2) that MFN is sensitive to the detection of another person's loss during positive inequity, and (3) that MFN is associated with a pleasant feeling during positive inequity, which is possibly related to "" Schadenfreude"". © 2011 American Psychological Association.",doi,10.1037/a0023854,Scopus,Emotion,"Yamada M., Lamm C., Decety J.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,"Pocket Rockets. The Past, Present, And Future Of Children's Portable Computing","This chapter takes a broad look at the category of small digital devices used by children up to age 15. It presents an overview of history of children's portable computing devices and portable electronics. The past five years have resulted in significant improvements in capability of portable devices at a lower cost. Children now have a digital delivery system in their pockets in the form of cell phones, and each device has created a niche market for related software. Cheaper, more powerful rechargeable batteries, LCD touch screens, and memory have given toy designers abilities of which they could have only dreamed a few years ago. Available children's mobile devices can be categorized as cell phones, TV toys or ""plug-and-play"" toys, tablet PCs, laptop computers, educational gaming platforms, electronic learning aids, portable gaming consoles, smart toys, digital cameras, portable media players, and electronic book readers. The main devices that are that are currently shaping the future of children's interactivity include, the Nintendo DS, the iPhone 3G (Apple) and the Google gPhone, eeePC, the Pulse smartpen, and Mark-My-Time Digital Bookmark. Based on the trajectory of the types of devices available today and considering the constant backdrop of human development, it is possible to make some assumptions about the future of mobile technologies. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

,Predicting Energy Expenditure From Accelerometry Counts In Adolescents Girls,"Purpose: Calibration of accelerometer counts against oxygen consumption to predict energy expenditure has not been conducted in middle school girls. We concurrently assessed energy expenditure and accelerometer counts during physical activities on adolescent girls to develop an equation to predict energy expenditure. Methods: Seventy-four girls aged 13-14 yr performed 10 activities while wearing an Actigraph accelerometer and a portable metabolic measurement unit (Cosmed K4b2). The activities were resting, watching television, playing a computer game, sweeping, walking 2.5 and 3.5 mph, performing step aerobics, shooting a basketball, climbing stairs, and running 5 mph. Height and weight were also assessed. Mixed-model regression was used to develop an equation to predict energy expenditure (EE) (kJ·min-1) from accelerometer counts. Results: Age (mean [SD] = 14 yr [0.34]) and body-weight-adjusted correlations of accelerometer counts with EE (kJ·min-1) for individual activities ranged from -0.14 to 0.59. Higher intensity activities with vertical motion were best correlated. A regression model that explained 85% of the variance of EE was developed: [EE (kJ·m-1) = 7.6628 + 0.1462 [(Actigraph counts per minute - 3000)/100] + 0.2371 (body weight in kilograms) - 0.00216 [(Actigraph counts per minute - 3000)/100]2 + 0.004077 [((Actigraph counts per minute - 3000)/100) x (body weight in kilograms)]. The MCCC = 0.85, with a standard error of estimate = 5.61 kJ·min-1. Conclusions: We developed a prediction equation for kilojoules per minute of energy expenditure from Actigraph accelerometer counts. This equation may be most useful for predicting energy expenditure in groups of adolescent girls over a period of time that will include activities of broad-ranging intensity, and may be useful to intervention researchers interested in objective measures of physical activity.",doi,10.1249/01.MSS.0000150084.97823.F7,Scopus,Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise,"Schmitz K.H., Treuth M., Hannan P., Mcmurray R., Ring K.B., Catellier D., Pate R.",2005,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Press C→ To Play The Ocarina: Rhetoric And Game Music,"The purpose of this chapter is to investigate the intersection where digital media studies meet rhetoric and rhetoric is re-introduced to musicology. In the recent academic excitement surrounding game studies, the music of games has been overshadowed. The author would like to call attention to the significance of game music and to consider a rhetorical method to approaching it that calls upon a rekindling of the history of coupling rhetoric with music. The author builds on this history by suggesting the foundation of a rhetorical framework for understanding the argumentative power of video game songs. He then moves to offer an approach for evaluating the ethos of game music that consists of assessing worlds and how they are carried through, and by, music. While 17th century baroque composers thought music to be fundamentally an issue of affections-and especially played off of emotional binaries such as joy/sadness as a rhetorical approach-the author hope to here revive this lost art of applying rhetoric to music through broadening the discussion beyond the matter of human emotion. This rhetorical approach allows the individual a framework with which to evaluate the ethos of game music as it now appears through numerous mobile operating systems, online environments, and as remediated forms manifesting in/as cultural artifacts. As games become ubiquitous, so do their songs. © 2013, IGI Global.",doi,10.4018/978-1-4666-2663-8.ch021,Scopus,Online Credibility and Digital Ethos: Evaluating Computer-Mediated Communication,Lawrence D.W.,2012,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Price Dynamics And Quality In Information Markets,"We explore the price dynamics of a vertically differentiated market in which two or more sellers compete to provide an information good or service to a population of buyers. Each seller offers the good or service at a fixed level of 'quality', and attempts to set its price in such a way that it maximizes its own profit. Five different seller pricing strategies, ranging widely from ones that require perfect knowledge and unlimited computational power to ones that require very little knowledge or computational capability, are employed in two different buyer populations. The resulting collective dynamics are studied using a combination of analysis and simulation. In a population of quality-sensitive buyers, all pricing strategies lead to a price equilibrium predicted by a game-theoretic analysis. However, in a population of price-sensitive buyers, most pricing strategies lead to large-amplitude cyclical price wars. The circumstances under which cyclical price wars occur can be explained in terms of the topology of an underlying 'profit landscape' [J.O. Kephart, J.E. Hanson, J. Sairamesh, Price and niche wars in a free-market economy of software agents, Artificial Life Journal, 4(1), 1998, 1-23].",doi,10.1016/S0167-9236(99)00073-1,Scopus,Decision Support Systems,"Sairamesh J., Kephart J.O.",2e3,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Processes Underlying Congruent And Incongruent Facial Reactions To Emotional Facial Expressions,"The present electromyographic study is a first step toward shedding light on the involvement of affective processes in congruent and incongruent facial reactions to facial expressions. Further, empathy was investigated as a potential mediator underlying the modulation of facial reactions to emotional faces in a competitive, a cooperative, and a neutral setting. Results revealed less congruent reactions to happy expressions and even incongruent reactions to sad and angry expressions in the competition condition, whereas virtually no differences between the neutral and the cooperation condition occurred. Effects on congruent reactions were found to be mediated by cognitive empathy, indicating that the state of empathy plays an important role in the situational modulation of congruent reactions. Further, incongruent reactions to sad and angry faces in a competition setting were mediated by the emotional reaction of joy, supporting the assumption that incongruent facial reactions are mainly based on affective processes. Additionally, strategic processes (specifically, the goal to create and maintain a smooth, harmonious interaction) were found to influence facial reactions while being in a cooperative mindset. Now, further studies are needed to test for the generalizability of these effects. © 2011 American Psychological Association.",doi,10.1037/a0023162,Scopus,Emotion,"Likowski K.U., Mühlberger A., Seibt B., Pauli P., Weyers P.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia

,Profiling Users In Educational Games,"For a long time, users' emotions and behaviours have been considered to obstruct rather than to help the cognitive process. Educational systems have based their learning strategies almost solely at a cognitive level and the internal state of the learner has often been ignored. Even if it is now recognized that learners' personalities and learning styles influence greatly their cognitive process (e.g. Multiple intelligences), very few systems have managed to profile users and adapt the educational content accordingly. Part of the reason for this is the difficulty to measure learning styles reliably and to establish a valid model that accounts for most of the major factors contributing to learning. Furthermore, since the introduction of formal education, it can be argued that learning has lost its playful and emotional aspect, whereby information was transmitted through story telling and play. On the other hand, video games have become a very popular medium among our digital natives. They provide a rich sensory and emotional environment in which they can experience a state of flow and are willing to stay for extended period of time. Despite of initial preconceptions on the negative effect of video games on young adults, it is now admitted that video games implicitly include many instructional design strategies (collaboration, exploration, Socratic dialogues, zone of proximal development, etc.) that could be harnessed to make formal education an experience that is more interactive and rewarding. One of the key features of video games is the ability to provide a content that matches players' emotional needs (e.g. recognition, social bounding, self-esteem, etc.) and that provides a wide range of interaction. The authors believe that this potential can be harnessed to create an educational content that matches users' learning styles and motivations. They propose the PLEASE model (Personality Learning styles, Emotions, Autonomy, Systematic Approach and Evaluation). This model addresses some of educational games design issues (e.g. choice of instructional strategy, type of feedback required, etc.); it categorizes and profiles users' learning styles in the light of educational and personality theories and defines a set of practical strategies for educational games designers in order to match students' learning styles and provide a user-centred content that is both motivating and educational. The authors explain how the Big-5 can be a more reliable alternative to measure learning styles, how emotions and personalities can be accounted in the cognitive process (e.g. information retrieval, memory retention, etc.) and also describe experiments they carried out in Cork to assess the effect of user-centred approaches in educational game design. Results are analysed and contrasted with current practices to show that unless personalities are accounted for in educational games, the educational outcomes could be different or even opposite to the one expected. © 2009, IGI Global.",doi,10.4018/978-1-60566-360-9.ch009,Scopus,Games-Based Learning Advancements for Multi-Sensory Human Computer Interfaces: Techniques and Effective Practices,"Felicia P., Pitt I.",2009,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,"Psychological Needs, Purpose In Life, And Problem Video Game Playing Among Chinese Young Adults","The negative impacts of excessive and problematic video game playing on both children and adults are attracting increasing concern. Based on self-determination theory (SDT; Ryan & Deci, 2000), this study hypothesized that the three basic psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness are positively associated with purpose in life, which in turn acts as a protective factor against problem video game playing among Chinese young adult players. Through a questionnaire survey with a sample of 165 Chinese adults aged between 18 and 30 years (mean age = 22.7 years), we found that perceived autonomy, competence, relatedness, and purpose in life were all negatively correlated with problem game playing. The demographic and psychological factors explained 38% of the variances of problem game playing. Specifically, gender, perceived relatedness, and purpose in life emerged as the three most salient predictors of problem game playing among the Chinese young adults. The mediating role of purpose in life was evidenced and it was found that purpose in life mediated the influences of the psychological needs proposed by SDT on problem game playing. Moreover, young men were significantly more susceptible to problem game playing than their female counterparts. To conclude, psychological needs and purpose in life influenced Chinese young adults' vulnerability to problem game playing directly or indirectly. Intervention programs that encourage social involvement and voluntary work, as well as counseling service that helps clients to search for life purpose, are suggested for intervening in problem game playing among Chinese young adults. © 2013 Copyright International Union of Psychological Science.",doi,10.1080/00207594.2012.658057,Scopus,International Journal of Psychology,"Wu A.M.S., Lei L.L.M., Ku L.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Psychophysiological Responses To Appraisal Dimensions In A Computer Game,"A computer game was used to study psychophysiological reactions to emotion-relevant events. Two dimensions proposed by Scherer (1984a, 1984b) in his appraisal theory, the intrinsic pleasantness and goal conduciveness of game events, were studied in a factorial design. The relative level at which a player performed at the moment of an event was also taken into account. A total of 33 participants played the game while cardiac activity, skin conductance, skin temperature, and muscle activity as well as emotion self-reports were assessed. The self-reports indicate that game events altered levels of pride, joy, anger, and surprise. Goal conduciveness had little effect on muscle activity but was associated with significant autonomic effects, including changes to interbeat interval, pulse transit time, skin conductance, and finger temperature. The manipulation of intrinsic pleasantness had little impact on physiological responses. The results show the utility of attempting to manipulate emotion-constituent appraisals and measure their peripheral physiological signatures. © 2004 Psychology Press Ltd.",doi,10.1080/02699930341000167,Scopus,Cognition and Emotion,"van Reekum C.M., Johnstone T., Banse R., Etter A., Wehrle T., Scherer K.R.",2004,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Race And Cardiovascular Reactivity: A Replication,"In a previous study, we reported that black children demonstrated greater cardiovascular reactivity than did white children to the psychological stress of a television video game.

Results indicated greater heart rate and blood pressure reactivity among black children than among white children. Thus, the previous results were replicated.

,Real-Time Eeg-Based Happiness Detection System,"We propose to use real-time EEG signal to classify happy and unhappy emotions elicited by pictures and classical music. We use PSD as a feature and SVM as a classifier. The average accuracies of subject-dependent model and subject-independent model are approximately 75.62% and 65.12%, respectively. Considering each pair of channels, temporal pair of channels (T7 and T8) gives a better result than the other area. Considering different frequency bands, high-frequency bands (Beta and Gamma) give a better result than low-frequency bands. Considering different time durations for emotion elicitation, that result from 30 seconds does not have significant difference compared with the result from 60 seconds. From all of these results, we implement real-time EEG-based happiness detection system using only one pair of channels. Furthermore, we develop games based on the happiness detection system to help user recognize and control the happiness. © 2013 Noppadon Jatupaiboon et al.",doi,10.1155/2013/618649,Scopus,The Scientific World Journal,"Jatupaiboon N., Pan-Ngum S., Israsena P.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Real Time Emotion Detection Within A Wireless Sensor Network And Its Impact On Power Consumption,"Recent advances in portable and wearable electroencephalograph (EEG) devices has raised the need to detect emotions in real time for applications such as wellbeing monitoring, gaming and social networking. A number of researchers have reported real time emotion detection systems implemented on a computer. This study advances these efforts by implementing a real time emotion detection system on a wirelesses sensor node with minimal hardware resources (256 kb of flash memory and 16 MHz processing speed) suitable for integration in a wearable wireless sensor node. The experimental results demonstrate that detecting emotions within the sensor node using suitable algorithms prolong the battery life by 5 days (38%) and by 39 days at an emotion detection rate of 2 and 60 s, respectively, as compared with transmitting the raw EEG data wirelessly. This also reduces the length of packets transmitted which directly minimises the packet error rate and the power that would be consumed because of retransmission of these erroneous packets. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2014.",doi,10.1049/iet-wss.2014.0056,Scopus,IET Wireless Sensor Systems,"Matiko J.W., Beeby S.P., Tudor J.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,"Realistic Facial Expression Of Virtual Human Based On Color, Sweat, And Tears Effects","Generating extreme appearances such as scared awaiting sweating while happy fit for tears (cry) and blushing (anger and happiness) is the key issue in achieving the high quality facial animation. The effects of sweat, tears, and colors are integrated into a single animation model to create realistic facial expressions of 3D avatar. The physical properties of muscles, emotions, or the fluid properties with sweating and tears initiators are incorporated. The action units (AUs) of facial action coding system are merged with autonomous AUs to create expressions including sadness, anger with blushing, happiness with blushing, and fear. Fluid effects such as sweat and tears are simulated using the particle system and smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) methods which are combined with facial animation technique to produce complex facial expressions. The effects of oxygenation of the facial skin color appearance are measured using the pulse oximeter system and the 3D skin analyzer. The result shows that virtual human facial expression is enhanced by mimicking actual sweating and tears simulations for all extreme expressions. The proposed method has contribution towards the development of facial animation industry and game as well as computer graphics. © 2014 Mohammed Hazim Alkawaz et al.",doi,10.1155/2014/367013,Scopus,Scientific World Journal,"Alkawaz M.H., Basori A.H., Mohamad D., Mohamed F.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,"Recognizing The Face Of Johnny, Suzy, And Me: Insensitivity To The Spacing Among Features At 4 Years Of Age","Four-year-olds were tested for their ability to use differences in the spacing among features to recognize familiar faces. They were given a storybook depicting multiple views of 2 children. They returned to the laboratory 2 weeks later and used a ""magic wand"" to play a computer game that tested their ability to recognize the familiarized faces and their own face based on the spacing of features. Children performed at chance levels. Follow-up studies confirmed that they had attended to internal facial features and validated the stimuli. The results contrast with studies showing some sensitivity to the spacing of features in infants and preschool children; multiple mechanisms of face processing may make use of spatial relations and develop at different rates. © 2006 by the Society for Research in Child Development, Inc.

,Reducing Heart Rate Reactivity To Stress With Feedback Generalization Across Task And Time,"Heart rate (HR) reactions to two behavioral stressors (videogame and mental arithmetic) were measured in 8 experimental subjects who received biofeedback training and 8 matched control subjects during three assessment periods: pretraining, posttraining, and one-week follow-up. Experimental subjects exhibited significant reductions in HR following a training session in which they received ongoing HR feedback while playing a videogame. Control subjects, who played the same number of videogames without HR feedback, showed smaller HR reductions. During the training session, all subjects were instructed to reduce HR while maximizing game perlormance. In comparison to controls, experimental subjects (a) maintained lower HRs during videogame presentations after a one-week period and (b) generalized these HR reductions to the mental arithmetic challenge at follow-up. Performance on the videogame declined from post-training to follow-up for experimental subjects but not for control subjects. No group difference in mental arithmetic performance was observed. © 1992, SAGE PUBLICATIONS, INC..

,Reliability And Validity Of Portable Blood Pressure/Pulse Units During A Competitive Challenge,"The aim of the present study was to determine the reliability and validity of recordings from three portable blood pressure/pulse units compared with simultaneous recordings from a polygraph used as the standard for these comparisons. The units tested included the Sears Digital Z153, Industrial Biomedical Sensor (IBS) Digital SD-700, and the Sphygmostat B-350/PU-102 (analog scale). Thirty healthy subjects were exposed to Pac-Man video game and mental arithmetic stressors. Each stressor was preceded by relaxation and followed by recovery periods. During each period, systolic/diastolic blood pressure and pulse were taken from one of the three portable units and the polygraph. The three units were reliable in recording systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate across baseline, stressor, and recovery periods. The blood pressure/pulse readings from the digital units by Sears and IBS corresponded more closely to simultaneous polygraph recordings than did the analog scale device by Sphygmostat. These results suggest that the digital blood pressure/pulse units employed in this investigation are reliable and valid measurement devices suitable for field research with clinical populations. © 1985 Psychonomic Society, Inc.",doi,10.3758/BF03214447,Scopus,"Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, & Computers","Follick M.J., Ahern D.K., Gorkin L.",1985,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Renal Trauma After Blunt Abdominal Injury,"AbstractBackground The kidney is the third most common solid organ injury in blunt abdominal trauma. The preferred treatment of blunt kidney injury varies according to grade of severity, with a preference for non-operative management in most instances. Discussion We examine an unusual case of blunt renal trauma. In this case, our patient presented with severe flank pain and hematuria after a game of softball. Our focused abdominal sonography for trauma revealed fluid in the splenorenal recess concerning for intra-abdominal injury, and subsequent abdominal computed tomography confirmed a grade IV kidney laceration. Conclusion Our patient was managed medically despite his high grade of injury. This article reviews the diagnosis and management of blunt renal trauma and highlights the fact that despite significant injury, a patient can go on to do well with conservative management alone. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",doi,10.1016/j.jemermed.2013.03.043,Scopus,Journal of Emergency Medicine,"Harper K., Shah K.H.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Repeated Exposure To Video Game Play Results In Decreased Blood Pressure Responding,"Repeated exposure to violent media is related to negative outcomes, including aggression, hostility, and cognitive and social deficits. We examined if cardiovascular and emotional responding to video game play changed across 3 weekly sessions. Participants were 41 adolescents (M age = 14.8; male = 29; female = 12) from rural Appalachia. Participants attended 3 weekly sessions and played 1 of 3 video games (basketball, fighting, or horror) each time. Measures included heart rate (HR); systolic blood pressure (SBP); diastolic blood pressure (DBP); self-reported aggression, anger, and reactions to game play; and history of video game play. Resting and posttést cardiovascular measures did not differ from session to session. Adolescents displayed HR and SBP reactivity to game play within each session. They also demonstrated decreased SBP and DBP responding to video game play across the 3-week period, regardless of game content. Affective responses did not change significantly across the course of the experiment. Adolescents who played the violent games reported more frustration and arousal than those who played the sports game. The implications of these findings are discussed.

,Repurposing The Microsoft Kinect For Windows V2 For External Head Motion Tracking For Brain Pet,"Medical imaging systems such as those used in positron emission tomography (PET) are capable of spatial resolutions that enable the imaging of small, functionally important brain structures. However, the quality of data from PET brain studies is often limited by subject motion during acquisition. This is particularly challenging for patients with neurological disorders or with dynamic research studies that can last 90 min or more. Restraining head movement during the scan does not eliminate motion entirely and can be unpleasant for the subject. Head motion can be detected and measured using a variety of techniques that either use the PET data itself or an external tracking system. Advances in computer vision arising from the video gaming industry could offer significant benefits when re-purposed for medical applications. A method for measuring rigid body type head motion using the Microsoft Kinect v2 is described with results presenting 0.5 mm spatial accuracy. Motion data is measured in real-time at 30 Hz using the KinectFusion algorithm. Non-rigid motion is detected using the residual alignment energy data of the KinectFusion algorithm allowing for unreliable motion to be discarded. Motion data is aligned to PET listmode data using injected pulse sequences into the PET/CT gantry allowing for correction of rigid body motion. Pilot data from a clinical dynamic PET/CT examination is shown. © 2015 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.",doi,10.1088/0031-9155/60/22/8753,Scopus,Physics in Medicine and Biology,"Noonan P.J., Howard J., Hallett W.A., Gunn R.N.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Review Of Semantic-Free Utterances In Social Human–Robot Interaction,"As a young and emerging field in social human–robot interaction (HRI), semantic-free utterances (SFUs) research has been receiving attention over the last decade. SFUs are an auditory interaction means for machines that allow emotion and intent expression, which are composed of vocalizations and sounds without semantic content or language dependence. Currently, SFUs are most commonly utilized in animation movies (e.g., R2-D2, WALL-E, Despicable Me), cartoons (e.g., “Teletubbies,” “Morph,” “La Linea”), and computer games (e.g., The Sims) and hold significant potential for applications in HRI. SFUs are categorized under four general types: Gibberish Speech (GS), Non-Linguistic Utterances (NLUs), Musical Utterances (MU), and Paralinguistic Utterances (PU). By introducing the concept of SFUs and bringing multiple sets of studies in social HRI that have never been analyzed jointly before, this article addresses the need for a comprehensive study of the existing literature for SFUs. It outlines the current grand challenges, open questions, and provides guidelines for future researchers considering to utilize SFU in social HRI.

,Reward And Punishment Hyposensitivity In Problem Gamblers: A Study Of Event-Related Potentials Using A Principal Components Analysis,"Objective: To investigate whether the latent neural correlates of incentive processing differ between problem gamblers (PGs) and healthy controls (HCs). Methods: Event-related potential (ERP) data were derived while 16 PGs and 20 HCs played a computer electronic gaming machine (EGM) task. Psychophysiological responses to outcomes commonly encountered during EGM gambling, including Large wins, Small wins, Near-wins, and Losses, were examined using a spatiotemporal principal components analysis (PCA). Subjects also completed questionnaires that assessed their levels of impulsivity, attraction to appetitive stimuli, and avoidance of aversive stimuli. Results: Losses elicited a feedback-related negativity (FRN), whereas wins elicited a feedback-related positivity (FRP) at the same latency and topography. PGs exhibited both attenuated FRN amplitudes following Losses and FRP amplitudes following Wins. Greater P3b amplitudes were found following Wins compared to Losses. FRN amplitudes following Near-wins were significantly reduced compared to Losses for both PGs and HCs. Trends for reduced P3b amplitudes following all outcome types, and for similar P3b amplitudes following Large and Small wins, were found for the PG group. Conclusions: We provide evidence that PGs are hyposensitive to both positive and negative outcomes. Significance: The finding that PGs are hyposensitive to reward and punishment provides valuable insight into the nature of deficit in this disorder, and provides a foundation for future research and clinical interventions. © 2014 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.",doi,10.1016/j.clinph.2014.10.011,Scopus,Clinical Neurophysiology,"Lole L., Gonsalvez C.J., Barry R.J.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Role Of Adolescent Female Volleyball Players' Psychophysiological Properties And Body Build In Performance Of Different Elements Of The Game.,"Body-build peculiarities (49 body measurements) and psychophysiological properties (21 computerized tests) of 32 adolescent female volleyballers were studied to assess their significance in performance at competitions. Games were recorded by the original computer program Game, and an index of proficiency representative elements of the game was calculated for each player. Regression analysis was applied to predict the best psychophysiological and anthropometric models for serve, reception, block, feint, and attack. Seven tests of psychophysiological indices and 14 anthropometric variables explained 38-98% and 32-83% of skill performance, respectively. Consequently, to improve young volleyball players' performance, everyday coaching should be complemented by detailed assessment of their body build and psychophysiological characteristics.",doi,10.2466/pms.101.1.108-120,pubmed,Perceptual and motor skills,"Stamm, Raini; Stamm, Meelis; Thomson, Kaivo",2006,NA,NA,reviewer1,Lydia

,Sentoy: An Affective Sympathetic Interface,"We describe the design and implementation of SenToy: a tangible doll with sensors that allows a user to influence the emotions of a synthetic character in a game. SenToy is an input device that allows the user to perform gestures or movements that the sensors inside the doll pick up. The gestures are interpreted according to a scheme found through two different user studies: one Wizard of Oz study and one study with a fully functioning SenToy. Different gestures express one of the following emotions: anger, fear, surprise, sadness, gloating and happiness. Depending upon the expressed emotion, the synthetic character in the game will, in turn, perform different actions (trading, duelling, etc.). The evaluation of SenToy acting as the interface to the computer game Fantasy A has shown that the users were able to express the desired emotions to influence the synthetic characters, and that overall players liked the doll as an interface. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

,Sex Differences In The Neural And Behavioral Response To Intranasal Oxytocin And Vasopressin During Human Social Interaction,"Both oxytocin (OT) and vasopressin (AVP) are known to modulate social behavior, and dysfunction in both systems has been postulated as a potential cause of certain psychiatric disorders that involve social behavioral deficits. In particular, there is growing interest in intranasal OT as a potential treatment for certain psychiatric disorders, and preliminary pre-clinical and clinical studies suggest efficacy in alleviating some of the associated symptoms. However, the vast majority of research participants in these studies have been male, and there is evidence for sexually differentiated effects of nonapeptides in both humans and non-human animals. To date, no study has investigated the effect of intranasal OT on brain function in human males and females within the same paradigm. Previously, in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind fMRI study, we reported effects of intranasal OT and AVP on behavior and brain activity of human males as they played an interactive social game known as the Prisoner's Dilemma Game. Here, we present findings from an identical study in human females, and compare these with our findings from males. Overall, we find that both behavioral and neural responses to intranasal OT and AVP are highly sexually differentiated. In women, AVP increased conciliatory behavior, and both OT and AVP caused women to treat computer partners more like humans. In men, AVP increased reciprocation of cooperation from both human and computer partners. However, no specific drug effects on behavior were shared between men and women. During cooperative interactions, both OT and AVP increased brain activity in men within areas rich in OT and AVP receptors and in areas playing a key role in reward, social bonding, arousal and memory (e.g., the striatum, basal forebrain, insula, amygdala and hippocampus), whereas OT and AVP either had no effect or in some cases actually decreased brain activity in these regions in women. OT treatment rendered neural responses of males more similar to responses of females in the placebo group and vice versa, raising the prospect of an inverted u-shaped dose response to central OT levels. These findings emphasize the need to fully characterize the effects of intranasal OT and AVP in both males and females and at multiple doses before widespread clinical application will be warranted. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.psyneuen.2013.09.022,Scopus,Psychoneuroendocrinology,"Rilling J.K., DeMarco A.C., Hackett P.D., Chen X., Gautam P., Stair S., Haroon E., Thompson R., Ditzen B., Patel R., Pagnoni G.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Simulating A Thermal Water Quality Trading Market For Education And Model Development,"Thermal water quality trading is an emerging policy tool that allows thermal polluters to comply with effluent restrictions by paying landowners to plant shade trees. A simulation game was created to help participants understand the structure, dynamics, benefits, and drawbacks of thermal water quality trading markets. Simulation participants negotiate to make trades, and their decisions are entered into a system dynamics model that simulates tree growth and water temperature. A debriefing session allows the participants to discuss outcomes and strategies. The exercise has been performed twice and has proven to be a useful teaching tool. These simulations provided valuable insight into decision-making strategies in thermal water quality trading markets, suggesting decision rules that the researchers used for subsequent model development. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.jenvman.2010.07.001,Scopus,Journal of Environmental Management,Bier A.,2010,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Simulation As An Engine Of Physical Scene Understanding,"In a glance, we can perceive whether a stack of dishes will topple, a branch will support a child's weight, a grocery bag is poorly packed and liable to tear or crush its contents, or a tool is firmly attached to a table or free to be lifted. Such rapid physical inferences are central to how people interact with the world and with each other, yet their computational underpinnings are poorly understood. We propose a model based on an ""intuitive physics engine,"" a cognitive-mechanism similar to computer engines that simulate rich physics in video games and graphics, but that uses approximate, probabilistic simulations to make robust and fast inferences in complex natural scenes where crucial information is unobserved.

,Small-Sided Games For Young Athletes: Is Game Specificity Influential?,"This study aimed to quantify and compare the physiological, physical and technical demands of a sport-specific and non-sport-specific small-sided game (SSG) in young athletes. Ten male soccer players (mean ± SD: age, 13.0 ± 0.3 years, V̇O2peak, 54.4 ± 4.9 ml · kg-1 · min-1) completed 3 vs. 3 and 6 vs. 6 soccer and ""bucketball"" SSGs twice. Games lasted for 16 min and were performed in a randomised order, at least 48 h apart. Movement patterns and heart rate were measured using 4 Hz global positioning systems. Technical skill executions were assessed by video analysis and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) using the Borg scale (RPEs, 6-20). Total distance (4.9 ± 4.1% and 8.3 ± 6.6%), distance at 7-12.9 km · h-1 (14.5 ± 12.5% and 14.9 ± 16.1%), total possessions (14.7 ± 18.0% and 12.9 ± 18.9%) and percentage of successful passes (24.1 ± 11.7% and 30.1 ± 17.6%) were higher for bucketball compared to soccer (3 vs. 3 and 6 vs. 6, respectively).

,Social Foraging Theory For Robust Multiagent System Design,"An analogy between an agent (e.g., an autonomous vehicle) and a biological forager is extended to a social environment by viewing a communication network as implementing interagent sociality. We first describe engineering design within an evolutionary game-theoretic framework. We then explain why sociality may emerge in some environments and for some agent objectives. Next, we derive the evolutionarily stable design strategy for an agent manufacturer: 1) choosing whether the agent it produces should cooperate with other agents in a search problem and 2) choosing the group size of a multiagent system tasked with a cooperative search problem. We show the impact of ""agent relatedness,"" a measure of common descent between two agents based on their underlying manufacturers, on the choices in scenarios 1) and 2). Our predictions are evaluated in an autonomous vehicle simulation testbed. The results illustrate a new methodology for manufacturers to make robust, optimal choices for multiagent system design for a given set of objectives and domain of operation. Note to Practitioners - The design of autonomous multirobot systems with various applications, such as in parts production or search and destroy operations in a military environment, is of growing importance. Here, we integrate economic and technical issues into an unified engineering design framework for the manufacturers of robots. Our approach leads to manufacturer design decisions that are robust relative to the market for a manufacturer's products. Robot component aspects, such as sensors and communications as well as mission performance aspects, can be captured and coupled into the design process. We use the design of intervehicle cooperation and robot group size to illustrate this approach. The practical significance lies in the fact that we take a broad perspective on engineering design, one closer to the real world, due to the considerations of market-place economics. Moreover, the approach provides a framework to study design choices that escape systematic analysis in other frameworks (e.g., group size). © 2007 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TASE.2006.872124,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,"Andrews B.W., Passino K.M., Waite T.A.",2007,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Social Media Versus Gaming Associations With Typical And Recent Dreams,"Cirucci (2013a) hypothesized that video game players would display similarities to social media users and that this relationship should be examined. This inquiry compared university students who varied in the degree to which they use social media (SMU) and play video games (VGP) on several dream indices and 1 personality inventory. Dreams have been shown to be continuous with waking mentation (Schredl, 2003) and to regulate negative emotions (Levin & Nielsen, 2009). Thus, they may offer a relatively unobstrusive measure of reactions to media use. Although there were meaningful differences between the 4 groups (high VGP/high SMU; high VGP/low SMU; low VGP/high SMU; low VGP/low SMU), most analysis resulted in no differences in dreams. Differences seemed to support the nightmare protection thesis of video game play such that high-end gamers, no matter the degree of social media use, suffered less from these negative types of dreams. Additionally, the high VGP/high SMU group had the thinnest psychological boundaries and thus were perhaps most susceptible to media effects. While at the same time this group of high-end media users showed the least negative self concepts in their recent dream content. This was reflected in their typical dream reports as well. © 2014 American Psychological Association.",doi,10.1037/a0037616,Scopus,Dreaming,"Gackenbach J., Boyes A.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Social Responsibility Tools In Online Gambling: A Survey Of Attitudes And Behavior Among Internet Gamblers,"To date, little empirical research has focused on social responsibility in gambling. This study examined players' attitudes and behavior toward using the social responsibility tool PlayScan designed by the Swedish gaming company Svenska Spel. Via PlayScan, players have the option to utilize various social responsibility control tools (e.g., personal gaming budgets, self-diagnostic tests of gambling habits, self-exclusion options). A total of 2,348 participants took part in an online questionnaire study. Participants were clientele of the Svenska Spel online gambling Web site. Results showed that just over a quarter of players (26%) had used PlayScan. The vast majority of those who had activated PlayScan (almost 9 in 10 users) said that PlayScan was easy to use. Over half of PlayScan users (52%) said it was useful; 19% said it was not. Many features were seen as useful by online gamblers, including limit setting (70%), viewing their gambling profile (49%), self-exclusion facilities (42%), self-diagnostic problem gambling tests (46%), information and support for gambling issues (40%), and gambling profile predictions (36%). In terms of actual (as opposed to theoretical) use, over half of PlayScan users (56%) had set spending limits, 40% had taken a self-diagnostic problem gambling test, and 17% had used a self-exclusion feature. © Copyright 2009, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",doi,10.1089/cpb.2009.0062,Scopus,Cyberpsychology and Behavior,"Griffiths M.D., Wood R.T.A., Parke J.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Social Television: Audience And Political Engagement,"The hypothesis of this work is that social TV can add to traditional TV audiencehood a sense of collective belonging - ""we the public"" - that is fundamental for any political action. After a quantitative account of users' patterns of activity during half a TV season, a qualitative methodology is adopted to understand the variety of social TV logics. Thus, a model of four different kinds and meanings of using social TV is developed: from the most engaged (civic-informative use of social TV) to the most recreational (the game use), from the outburst of emotions (emotional use) to the identity-building and awareness use. Each of those represents various forms of relationships among individuals in a social medium environment, and between them and other actors of the wider contemporary mediated public space, such as civic and political groups, and political news media professionals. © The Author(s) 2015.",doi,10.1177/1527476415616192,Scopus,Television and New Media,Selva D.,2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Socio-Demographic Differences In Parental Monitoring Of Children In Late Childhood And Adolescents’ Screen-Based Media Use,"According to a social cognitive theory, children may learn to function through processes of modeling and observational learning, with parents and the media being the significant sources of socialization and learning in the home environment. Adolescence is a period when children progressively look for autonomy and independence. One of the important research questions is whether adolescents utilize screen-based media with or without parental monitoring and limit-setting. This exploratory study examines socio-demographic factors associated with parenting (i.e., co-using, limit setting on the amount, limit setting on contents, and active mediation) in regards to television and video game usage during adolescence. Participants were 799 adolescents (5th to 12th graders) and their parents. Results indicate no gender differences in parental monitoring, but age/grade differences were found with less parental monitoring (more autonomy or independence) of older children. Parental monitoring also differed by ethnicity and by household income. Asian parents were the most restrictive while Hispanic parents were the least restrictive. Parents also reported more active mediation or engagement in families with higher household income. Findings initiate consideration of parenting styles in adolescent media usage, which have implications for adolescent adjustment and developmental outcomes. © 2016 Broadcast Education Association.",doi,10.1080/08838151.2016.1164168,Scopus,Journal of Broadcasting and Electronic Media,Top N.,2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Sram Circuit Design,"Today's mobile computing and communication devices such as video phone, handheld video games, etc., represent the most important factors driving the need for low power design. The commercial success of these devices depends significantly on the duration of autonomous operation. This class of products therefore requires low power consumption as well as high or medium performance, which in turn depends on the technology and the design techniques used. For cost and reliability issues the preferred components for implementation of state-of-the-art portable devices are System-on-Chip (SoC) ICs. The SoC integrates many functions such as digital, memory, analog mixed-signal, and often radio-frequency functions, all on one chip. To satisfy requirements of multimedia applications, SoCs embed Static-Random-Access-Memory modules (SRAM), which occupy more than 60% of the total SoC area and are responsible for a large portion of the total power consumption. Therefore, the SRAM module is required to have both high operating performance to deal with multimedia applications and low power consumption to prolong battery life. Active power consumption of CMOS logic circuits increases quadrati-cally with supply voltage; hence, minimizing the supply voltage is one of the most effective ways to reduce energy usage but unfortunately this comes at the expense of lower speed. To get the best trade-off, supply voltage and threshold voltage scaling along with process is needed. However the increase of leakage current limits the threshold voltage reduction as well as the supply voltage scaling. Moreover, in 45 nm technology and below, voltage scaling becomes very complex due to the difficulty of the SRAM operation. In fact, in order to achieve very high density, the SRAM cell is implemented with the smallest size MOS transistors, which in turn are more and more impacted by the increase of process fluctuations. It results in many obstacles to overcome to achieve low-voltage operation, such as adequate read margin, write ability and operating speed [1]. © 2009 Springer Netherlands.",doi,10.1007/978-1-4020-9341-8_8,Scopus,Planar Double-Gate Transistor: From Technology to Circuit,"Giraud B., Thomas O., Amara A., Vladimirescu A., Belleville M.",2009,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Stability Of Ethnic Differences In Children’s Pressor Responses During Three Annual Examinations,"In this study, 395 healthy children had blood pres­sure and heart rate measured both at rest and dur­ing a stressful video game. Identical measurement procedures were used for three annual examina­tions. Consistently, black children demonstrated significantly greater pressor responses than white children. In view of the greater prevalence of hy­pertension among black adults than white adults, these data suggest that blacks exhibit hemody­namic irregularities well before the onset or diag­nosis of hypertension. © 1991 by the American Journal of Hypertension, Inc.",doi,10.1093/ajh/4.7.630,Scopus,American Journal of Hypertension,"Murphy J.K., Alpert B.S., Walker S.S.",1991,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Stability Of Internal Response And External Load During 4-A-Side Football Game In An Indoor Environment,"Background: Small-sided games (SSG) are spontaneous forms of specific training where exercise intensity can be manipulated mainly by modifying external factors. When using the SSG, there is a risk that the variability of intensity between players and on repetition of SSG may lead to some players training at inappropriate exercise intensities. Objective: The purpose of this study is to determine intra-individual repeatability and inter-individual variability in exercise intensity in small-sided 4on4 football games. Methods: Twenty five highly trained junior football players (age 17.68 ± 1.52 years; BMI 23.8 ± 1.92 kg · m–2) participated in the study. Distance covered (software package Video Manual Motion Tracker 1.0) and heart rate (HR, expressed as a percentage of peak heart rate) were measured. All participants completed three measurements of 4-a-side games for three consecutive weeks. Results: The high intraclass correlation coefficient value (Heart rate [HR]: ICC = .88, 95% CI [.65, .94]; Distance covered [DC]: ICC = .76, 95% CI [.66, .96]) implies a very high level of intra-individual repeatability. The Pearson’s correlation coefficient value (HR: r = .93; DC: r = .85) indicates a high correlation between the results of any measurement. Bland and Altman’s 95% limits of agreement were ± 10.32 beats · min–1 and ± 65.46 m of distance covered. Conclusions: The results of this study demonstrated that measured SSG elicit consistent heart rate responses and external load of the players. © 2015 K.

,Story Immersion May Be Effective In Promoting Diet And Physical Activity In Chinese Children,"Objective To evaluate the effect of playing a health video game embedded with story immersion, Escape from Diab (Diab), on children's diet and physical activity (PA) and to explore whether children immersed in Diab had greater positive outcomes. Design Two groups, nonrandomized; 3 outcome assessments: at baseline, immediately after the game (post 1), and 8–10 weeks after the game (post 2). Participants A total of 179 Chinese children aged 8–12 years. Intervention The treatment group played Diab; the control group received no intervention. Main Outcome Measures Motivation; self-efficacy; preference for fruit, vegetables, water, and PA; as well as PA behavior. Analysis Adjusted changes to post 1 and post 2 by ANCOVA controlling for demographic and baseline variables. Results Children who played Diab had increased intrinsic motivation for fruit and water, self-efficacy for PA, and self-reported PA scores at post 1 (all P < .05). Children with higher immersion scores (above the median) had increased intrinsic motivation for fruit and water, and autonomous and controlled motivation for PA at post 1 (all P < .05). However, these were not significant at post 2. Conclusions and Implications Diab provides a promising innovative medium for promoting Chinese children's psychological correlates of diet and PA and PA behavior. However, its maintenance of effectiveness needs to be enhanced and mechanisms of change need to be investigated more thoroughly. © 2017 Society for Nutrition Education and Behavior",doi,10.1016/j.jneb.2017.01.001,Scopus,Journal of Nutrition Education and Behavior,"Wang J.J., Baranowski T., Lau P.W.C., Buday R., Gao Y.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Stress Reduces Diastolic Function In Youth,"Objective: Research regarding the influence of mental stress (MS) on heart function focused primarily on heart contractility. We hypothesized that MS results in attenuated diastolic function (DF) as early as in adolescence and this effect may differ by race and sex. Methods: 161 normotensive adolescents (81 blacks and 80 females) performed resting (control) and MS (experimental) conditions on separate visits. Visits lasted for 3 hours (1-hour rest, video game challenge and recovery for experimental visit. Mitral inflow early (E) to late (A) filling velocities (E/A) ratio; mitral valve annular early velocity (E′) and E/E′ ratio were recorded every 30 minutes to evaluate DF. Results: BP and HR increased during experimental visit (all p values < .01). E/A ratio progressively increased during control visit (mean [SE], from 1.93 ± 0.42 to 2.01 ± 0.47) but decreased during the stress phase of experimental visit (from 1.91 ± 0.44 to 1.87 ± 0.50, p interaction < .001). In white males, E′ increased from rest to stress phase (from 10.3 ± 2.55 to 10.7 ± 2.28 cm/s), whereas E′ decreased in white females (from 11.0 ± 2.62 to 10.6 ± 2.53 cm/s), black males (from 10.5 ± 2.31 to 9.9 ± 2.19 cm/s), and black females (from 10.6 ± 2.22 to 10.3 ± 1.86 cm/s, p interaction < .04). During stress, higher A was associated with higher E/E′ ratio. Conclusions: Recurrent episodes of mental stress may increase the risk of poor DF, and these adverse effects may be stronger in females and black males. © 2012 by the American Psychosomatic Society.",doi,10.1097/PSY.0b013e31825b920b,Scopus,Psychosomatic Medicine,"Kapuku G.K., Davis H., Murdison K., Robinson V., Harshfield G.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,"Strutting Hero, Sneaking Villain: Utilizing Body Motion Cues To Predict The Intentions Of Others","A better understanding of how intentions and traits are perceived from body movements is required for the design of more effective virtual characters that behave in a socially realistic manner. For this purpose, realistic body motion, captured from human movements, is being used more frequently for creating characters with natural animations in games and entertainment. However, it is not always clear for programmers and designers which specific motion parameters best convey specific information such as certain emotions, intentions, or traits. We conducted two experiments to investigate whether the perceived traits of actors could be determined from their body motion, and whether these traits were associated with their perceived intentions. We first recorded body motions from 26 professional actors, who were instructed to move in a ""hero""-like or a ""villain""-like manner. In the first experiment, 190 participants viewed individual video recordings of these actors and were required to provide ratings to the body motion stimuli along a series of different cognitive dimensions (intentions, attractiveness, dominance, trustworthiness, and distinctiveness). The intersubject ratings across observers were highly consistent, suggesting that social traits are readily determined from body motion. Moreover, correlational analyses between these ratings revealed consistent associations across traits, for example, that perceived ""good"" intentions were associated with higher ratings of attractiveness and dominance. Experiment 2 was designed to elucidate the qualitative body motion cues that were critical for determining specific intentions and traits from the hero- and villain-like body movements. The results revealed distinct body motions that were readily associated with the perception of either ""good"" or ""bad"" intentions. Moreover, regression analyses revealed that these ratings accurately predicted the perception of the portrayed character type. These findings indicate that intentions and social traits are communicated effectively via specific sets of body motion features. Furthermore, these results have important implications for the design of the motion of virtual characters to convey desired social information. © 2015 ACM.",doi,10.1145/2791293,Scopus,ACM Transactions on Applied Perception,"Kiiski H., Hoyet L., Woods A.T., O'Sullivan C., Newell F.N.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,"Study Protocol Of The Internet User Cohort For Unbiased Recognition Of Gaming Disorder In Early Adolescence (Icure), Korea, 2015-2019","Introduction In 2013, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) proposed nine internet gaming disorder (IGD) diagnostic criteria as a condition warranting further empirical and clinical research. The aim of this study is to clarify the natural and clinical courses of IGD proposed DSM-5 in adolescents and to evaluate its risk and protective factors. Methods and analysis The Internet user Cohort for Unbiased Recognition of gaming disorder in Early Adolescence (iCURE) study is an ongoing multidisciplinary, prospective, longitudinal cohort study conducted in 21 schools in Korea. Participant recruitment commenced in March 2015 with the goal of registering 3000 adolescents. The baseline assessment included surveys on emotional, social and environmental characteristics. A parent or guardian completed questionnaires and a structured psychiatric comorbidity diagnostic interview regarding their children. Adolescents with the Internet Game Use-Elicited Symptom Screen total scores of 6 or higher were asked to participate in the clinical diagnostic interview. Two subcohorts of adolescents were constructed: a representative subcohort and a clinical evaluation subcohort. The representative subcohort comprises a randomly selected 10% of the iCURE to investigate the clinical course of IGD based on clinical diagnosis and to estimate the false negative rate. The clinical evaluation subcohort comprised participants meeting three or more of the nine IGD criteria, determined by clinical diagnostic interview, to show the clinical course of IGD. Follow-up data will be collected annually for the 3 years following the baseline assessments. The primary endpoint is 2-year incidence, remission and recurrence rates of IGD. Cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between exposures and outcomes as well as mediation factors will be evaluated.

,Supervisory Control Of Multiple Robots In Dynamic Tasking Environments,"A military targeting environment was simulated to examine the effects of an intelligent route-planning agent RoboLeader, which could support dynamic robot re-tasking based on battlefield developments, on the performance of robotics operators. We manipulated the level of assistance (LOAs) provided by RoboLeader as well as the presence of a visualisation tool that provided feedback to the participants on their primary task (target encapsulation) performance. Results showed that the participants' primary task benefited from RoboLeader on all LOAs conditions compared to manual performance; however, visualisation had little effect. Frequent video gamers demonstrated significantly better situation awareness of the mission environment than did infrequent gamers. Those participants with higher spatial ability performed better on a secondary target detection task than did those with lower spatial ability. Finally, participants' workload assessments were significantly lower when they were assisted by RoboLeader than when they performed the target entrapment task manually.Practitioner Summary: This study demonstrated the utility of an intelligent agent for enhancing robotics operators' supervisory control performance as well as reducing their workload during a complex urban scenario involving moving targets. The results furthered the understanding of the interplay among level-of-autonomy, multitasking performance and individual differences in military tasking environments. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",doi,10.1080/00140139.2012.689013,Scopus,Ergonomics,"Chen J.Y.C., Barnes M.J.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Systems Thinking And Organizational Learning: Acting Locally And Thinking Globally In The Organization Of The Future,"To learn more rapidly and increase flexibility in a world of growing complexity and change, firms are experimenting with new modes of organization, new reward systems, and less authoritarian values - for example, reducing hierarchy, increasing local decision-making responsibility and individual incentives, and rewarding innovation. But local decision making and individual autonomy lead to management anarchy unless managers account for the interconnections and long-term side-effects of their local decisions. Laudable goals such as 'empowering' and 'enabling' individuals often prove counterproductive unless managers can act locally and think globally. Managers must become 'systems thinkers' as well as better learners. This paper reports on one approach to these issues: forming collaborative action research partnerships with corporations to 1) develop new tools to accelerate learning, and 2) test those tools in real organizations where managers face pressing issues. We argue that simulation is an important element of successful learning laboratories to develop systems thinking and promote organizational learning. A case study focused on improving quality and total cost performance in the insurance industry is presented to illustrate how these tools can both produce insight and focus change. © 1992.",doi,10.1016/0377-2217(92)90011-W,Scopus,European Journal of Operational Research,"Senge P.M., Sterman J.D.",1992,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Taking Action In The Face Of Threat: Neural Synchronization Predicts Adaptive Coping,"The ability to take action in the face of threat is highly diverse across individuals. What are the neural processes that determine individual differences in the ability to cope with danger? We hypothesized that the extent of synchronization between amygdala, striatum, and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) would predict successful active coping performance. To test this, we developed a novel computer task based on the principals of Sidman avoidance. Healthy human participants learned through trial and error to move a marker between virtual game board compartments once every 3 s to avoid mild shocks. Behaviorally, participants exhibited large individual differences. Strikingly, both amygdala-mPFC and caudate-mPFC coupling during active coping trials covaried with final active coping performance across participants. These findings indicate that synchronization between mPFC subregions, and both amygdala and caudate predicts whether individuals will achieve successful active coping performance by the end of training. Thus, successful performance of adaptive actions in the face of threat requires functional synchronization of a neural circuit consisting of mPFC, striatum, and amygdala. Malfunction in the crosstalk between these components might underlie anxiety symptoms and impair individuals’ ability to actively cope under stress. This opens an array of possibilities for therapeutic targets for fear and anxiety disorders. © 2014 the authors.",doi,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2152-14.2014,Scopus,Journal of Neuroscience,"Collins K.A., Mendelsohn A., Cain C.K., Schiller D.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Talking About Interest: Exploring The Role Of Social Interaction For Regulating Motivation And The Interest Experience,"The Self-Regulation of Motivation Model suggests that the experience of interest is an important source of human motivation and that people often strategically regulate the experience of interest. Previous work based on this model suggests that the social context may influence this process at multiple points. The present research focuses on whether talking to others about an activity experience is one means by which individuals evaluate how interesting that activity is. In Study 1 college students completed questionnaires that asked about real life experiences where working on an activity was more interesting because they worked with others. They described experiences that occurred first in any domain, and then that occurred specifically in the school domain. Results suggested that the more students talked with others about the activity after it happened the more they reported greater interest in the activity after the conversations. In the school domain, this was especially true for Latinos and for individuals who scored higher on the Relational Self-Construal scale. Study 2 employed a lab paradigm to control for the task that individuals talked to others about and to examine whether the nature of listeners' reactions influenced the speaker's interest even after the study was ostensibly over. First, replicating Pasupathi and Rich (2005, 'Inattentive listening undermines self-verification in personal storytelling', Journal of Personality 73, pp. 1051-1086) college students who talked to a distracted friend about a computer game during the lab session reported a significant drop in interest relative to those who talked to attentive friends, regardless of whether the attentive listeners agreed or disagreed with participants. Importantly, interest ratings at a 4-6 week follow-up were affected by the perceived responsiveness of listeners during spontaneous conversational retellings outside the lab, controlling for interest levels at the end of the lab session. Taken together, results suggest that social interaction plays an important role in regulating activity interest even beyond the immediate activity experience. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",doi,10.1007/s10902-006-9016-3,Scopus,Journal of Happiness Studies,"Thoman D.B., Sansone C., Pasupathi M.",2007,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Team Knowledge With Motivation In A Successful Mmorpg Game Team: A Case Study,"We studied the content of the team mental model with a case study about a successful online game team. This team was formed by high-ranking managers in a large raid guild to conduct a raid in War of Worldcraft. They were interviewed with a set of 5-W questions developed according to the conceptualizations of team mental model (Levine & Moreland, 1991). Toward the interview protocol, a content analysis was conducted with two-cycle coding method from exploratory to explanatory and a hierarchical framework from code, category, theme, to theory were generated to describe the team mental model. In the first cycle, 17 codes were extracted from participants' own wording for concepts that were shared by whom controlled various gaming characters. These codes are knowledge convergence about the problem at-hand, actors, events, affects and outcomes - what the core gamers have experienced through the collaborative gaming process. In the second cycle, coding was guided by learning theories. Six categories, mingled from 17 codes, showed collective knowledge of co-work process, leaders' works, work under supervision, seeking joint fun, relationship oriented, and balance between extrinsic-intrinsic motivations. From 6 categories, two themes were synthesized: the team (1) performed ""joint hard work"" for (2) seeking ""joint hard fun."" The first theme comprised declarative and procedural knowledge representations and we consider it to be the commonality between this game team and ordinary work/learning teams. The second theme was composed of affective and cognitive evaluation components about intrinsic motivation which is in accordance with Self-determination theory (SDT, Deci & Ryan, 2000). In general, ""Jointly hard work for hard fun"" is the gist content of the team mental model. We found ample evidences that members explicitly recall shared motivational beliefs of team mates and emotional-motivational events in gaming. Based on the results of this study, several implications have been addressed for teachers to enhance students' intrinsic motivation in conducting quality Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning. Future studies are needed to further explore the relationship between the quality of team mental models and team-level performance. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

,Temperature Control In Three-Network On Chips Using Task Migration,"Combination of three-dimensional (3D) IC technology and network on chip (NoC) is an effective solution to increase system scalability and also alleviate the interconnect problem in large-scale integrated circuits. However, because of the increased power density in 3D NoC systems and the destructive effect of high temperatures on chip reliability, applying thermal management solutions becomes crucial in such circuits. In this study, the authors propose a runtime distributed migration algorithm based on game theory to balance the heat dissipation among processing elements (PEs) in a 3D NoC chip multiprocessor. The objective of this algorithm is to minimise the 3D NoC system's peak temperature, as well as the overhead imposed on chip performance during migration. Owing to the high thermal correlation between adjacent PEs in the same stack in 3D NoCs, the authors model this multi-objective problem as a cooperative game. The simulation results indicate upto 23 and 27% decrease in peak temperature, for the benchmarks that have the highest communication rate and the largest number of tasks, respectively. This comes at the price of slight migration overhead in terms of power-delay product. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2013.",doi,10.1049/iet-cdt.2013.0016,Scopus,IET Computers and Digital Techniques,"Hassanpour N., Hessabi H., Hamedani P.K.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Testing The Prosocial Effectiveness Of The Prototypical Moral Emotions: Elevation Increases Benevolent Behaviors And Outrage Increases Justice Behaviors,"How can we overcome apathy and instigate a desire to help others? This research tests and compares the prosocial effects of two of the most prototypical emotions on a range of prosocial intentions and behaviors. Emotion-inducing videos were used to instigate states of moral elevation (felt when witnessing a moral virtue) and/or moral outrage (felt when witnessing a moral transgression). Although elevation and outrage are derived from opposing appraisals, separate strands of research show that they both instigate a desire to help others. The current research tests the appraisal tendency framework to explore whether elevation and outrage increase prosociality across moral domains or whether their prosocial effects are domain specific. Results of Experiment 1 showed that elevation, but not outrage, increased donations to charity (i.e., benevolence domain). Experiment 2 showed that outrage, but not elevation, increased prosocial political action intentions (i.e., justice domain). Experiment 3 showed that outrage, but not elevation, increased compensation in a third-party bystander game (i.e., justice domain). This research shows that although elevation and outrage both inspire a desire to help others, they affect distinct types of prosocial behaviors, offering support for the appraisal tendency framework. Applied and theoretical implications are discussed. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",doi,10.1016/j.jesp.2014.12.005,Scopus,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,"Van de Vyver J., Abrams D.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,"Testosterone Across Successive Competitions: Evidence For A “Winner Effect” In Humans? Psychoneuroendocrinology, 47, 1–9.","In many species testosterone fluctuates in concert with outcome-dependent changes in social status, such that winning a competition leads to an increase in circulating testosterone (i.e., competition effect). Although this phenomenon has been well studied in humans, the cumulative endocrine impact of multiple successive competitions is poorly understood. Moreover, although changes in testosterone after a competition seem to predict immediate aggressive behavior, competitive motivation, risk-taking, and affiliation, whether this endocrine response also has long-term behavioral effects, as suggested by studies in non-human animals, has not been examined. In this study, salivary testosterone was collected from pairs of male participants engaging, on two consecutive days, in head-to-head competitions on a previously validated laboratory task. We found that testosterone reactivity on the first day, which was congruent with the competition effect (i.e., net testosterone increase in randomly assigned winners), predicted the task performance on the second day. Further, when looking at testosterone reactivity on the second day, those individuals that lost both competitions experienced the steepest decline in testosterone compared to those individuals who lost on the second day but won on the first day. Testosterone fluctuations on the second day were also analyzed considering the type of status hierarchy (stable vs. unstable) that emerged as a result of the combined outcomes of the two competitions. In accordance with the challenge hypothesis, men in unstable hierarchies (first day winners/second day losers and first day losers/second day winners) experienced an increase in testosterone compared to men in the stable hierarchies (double winners and double losers). Results are discussed within a comparative perspective, drawing parallels with the winner effect and the challenge hypothesis observed in non-human animals.",doi,10.1016/j.psyneuen.2014.05.001,nagy2015,Psychoneuroendocrinology,"Zilioli, S., Watson, N.

,The Appeal Of Violent Video Games To Lower Educated Aggressive Adolescent Boys From Two Countries.,"The objective of this study was to test the effect of individual differences on appeal and use of video games. Participants were 299 adolescent boys from lower and higher secondary schools in the Netherlands and Belgium. In general, boys were most attracted to violent video games. Boys that scored higher in trait aggressiveness and lower in empathy were especially attracted to violent games and spent more time playing video games than did boys lower in trait aggressiveness. Lower educated boys showed more appreciation for both violent and nonviolent games and spent more time playing them than did higher educated boys. The present study showed that aggressive and less empathic boys were most attracted to violent games. The fact that heavy users of violent games show less empathy and higher aggressiveness suggests the possibility of desensitization. Other studies have shown that playing violent games increases aggressiveness and decreases empathy. These results combined suggest the possibility of a violence cycle. Aggressive individuals are attracted to violent games. Playing violent games increases aggressiveness and decreases empathy, which in turn leads to increased appreciation and use of violent games.",doi,10.1089/cpb.2006.9.638,anderson2010,CyberPsychology & Behavior,"Lemmons, J.

,The Asthma Epidemic And Our Artificial Habitats,"Background: The recent increase in childhood asthma has been a puzzling one. Recent views focus on the role of infection in the education of the immune system of young children. However, this so called hygiene hypothesis fails to answer some important questions about the current trends in asthma or to account for environmental influences that bear little relation to infection. Discussion: The multi-factorial nature of asthma, reflecting the different ways we tend to interact with our environment, mandates that we look at the asthma epidemic from a broader perspective. Seemingly modern affluent lifestyles are placing us increasingly in static, artificial, microenvironments very different from the conditions prevailed for most part of our evolution and shaped our organisms. Changes that occurred during the second half of the 20th century in industrialized nations with the spread of central heating/conditioning, building insulation, hygiene, TV/PC/games, manufactured food, indoor entertainment, cars, medical care, and sedentary lifestyles all seem to be depriving our children from the essential inputs needed to develop normal airway function (resistance). Asthma according to this view is a manifestation of our respiratory maladaptation to modern lifestyles, or in other words to our increasingly artificial habitats. The basis of the artificial habitat notion may lie in reduced exposure of innate immunity to a variety of environmental stimuli, infectious and non-infectious, leading to reduced formulation of regulatory cells/cytokines as well as inscribed regulatory pathways. This could contribute to a faulty checking mechanism of non-functional Th2 (and likely Th1) responses, resulting in asthma and other immuno-dysregulation disorders. Summary: In this piece I discuss the artificial habitat concept, its correspondence with epidemiological data of asthma and allergy, and provide possible immunological underpinning for it from an evolutionary perspective of health and disease. © 2005 Maziak; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",doi,10.1186/1471-2466-5-5,Scopus,BMC Pulmonary Medicine,Maziak W.,2005,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,"The Better The Story, The Bigger The Serving: Narrative Transportation Increases Snacking During Screen Time In A Randomized Trial","Background: Watching television and playing video games increase energy intake, likely due to distraction from satiety cues. A study comparing one hour of watching TV, playing typical video games, or playing motion-controlled video games found a difference across groups in energy intake, but the reasons for this difference are not clear. As a secondary analysis, we investigated several types of distraction to determine potential psychosocial mechanisms which may account for greater energy intake observed during sedentary screen time as compared to motion-controlled video gaming.Methods: Feelings of enjoyment, engagement (mental immersion), spatial presence (the feeling of being in the game), and transportation (immersion in a narrative) were investigated in 120 young adults aged 18 - 35 (60 female).Results: Only narrative transportation was associated with total caloric intake (ρ = .205, P = .025). Transportation was also higher in the TV group than in the gaming groups (P = .002) and higher in males than in females (P = .003). Transportation mediated the relationship between motion-controlled gaming (as compared to TV watching) and square root transformed energy intake (indirect effect = -1.34, 95% confidence interval -3.57, -0.13). No other distraction-related variables were associated with intake.Conclusions: These results suggest that different forms of distraction may differentially affect eating behavior during screen time, and that narrative appears to be a particularly strong distractor. Future studies should further investigate the effects of narrative on eating behavior. © 2013 Lyons et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",doi,10.1186/1479-5868-10-60,Scopus,International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity,"Lyons E.J., Tate D.F., Ward D.S.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,The Cardiovascular Effects Of Nicotine During Stress,"The acute cardiovascular effects of smoking during stress may be greater than those of smoking or stress alone, a finding which could have implications for determining which smokers may be at particular risk for coronary heart disease (CHD). Methodological problems inherent in using tobacco smoking to deliver nicotine (believed responsible for smoking's cardiovascular effects) prevent clear examination of the cardiovascular effects of inhaled nicotine. This study compared the cardiovascular increases due to a video game stress task plus 1.0 mg nicotine with those of stress or nicotine alone using an aerosol method of presenting nicotine in measured doses. Twelve young male smokers each participated in four conditions on 4 separate days: stress + nicotine, stress + placebo (stress alone), rest + nicotine (nicotine alone), and rest + placebo. The effects of stress and nicotine were additive for heart rate but less than additive for systolic and diastolic blood pressure. These results indicate that the combined effects of stress and nicotine may be relevant to understanding the prevalence of CHD among smokers. They also suggest that the effects of each on cardiovascular activity may be different, as the effects are independent for heart rate but overlap for blood pressure. © 1986 Springer-Verlag.",doi,10.1007/BF00179194,Scopus,Psychopharmacology,"Perkins K.A., Epstein L.H., Jennings J.R., Stiller R.",1986,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,The Design Of Emotionally Engaging Products,"Dennis Wixon, a member of Microsoft Game Studios, has offered his views on the design of emotionally engaging products and the research tools needed to create them. The different types of design includes mechanics, dynamics, and aesthetics. Mechanics are the goals and rules of the game, while the dynamics is what the user brings such as experience and knowledge to the game. Dynamics then gives rise to aesthetics, which focuses on what the user concludes about the game. This model, called the Jamesian bodily feedback model, in consistency with the James-Lange theory shows that behavior leads to judgments or conclusions, among which are emotions. This approach helps avoid a classic philosophical error that most psychologists and many people in general often make. This approach also urges researchers and designers to think in the most concrete and specific terms. OXO products, which follows this approach, are designed to be touched to feel good when using them.",doi,10.1145/1288515.1288531,Scopus,Interactions,"Wixon D., De Los Reyes A.",2007,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia

,The Effect Of Exergaming On Vascular Function In Children,"Objectives: To assess whether exergaming can induce measurable changes in heart rate (HR), energy expenditure (EE), and flow-mediated dilation (FMD) arterial function in healthy children. Study design: Fifteen children (8 males, 10.1 ± 0.7 years, body mass index 17.9 ± 2.4 kg.m-2) undertook a graded exercise test and 2 × 15 minute exergaming sessions (Xbox 360â€Kinect); high intensity exergaming (HiE, Kinect Sports-200 m Hurdles) and low intensity exergaming (LoE, Kinect Sports-Ten Pin Bowling). Brachial artery FMD, a measure of endothelial function and arterial health, was measured before and immediately after each exergaming intervention. Actihearts were used to measure EE and HR during game play and a physical activity enjoyment scale assessed enjoyment. Results: Average HR during HiE (146 ± 11 beats per minute) was greater than during LoE (104 ± 11 beats per minute, P &lt;.05), a pattern reinforced by EE data (HiE 294.6 ± 75.2 J.min-1.kg-1, LoE 73.7 ± 44.0 J.min -1.kg-1, P &lt;.05). FMD decreased after HiE (P &lt;.05), whereas no change was observed following LoE. Subjects reported no differences in enjoyment between LoE and HiE. Conclusion: HiE, but not LoE, induced large HR and EE responses that were associated with effects on vascular function. This study suggests that an acute bout of HiE exergaming may provide a substrate for beneficial arterial adaptations in children. © 2013 Mosby Inc.

,The Effect Of Playing Violent Video Games On Adolescents: Should Parents Be Quaking In Their Boots?,"Debate regarding the psychological and behavioural effects of playing violent video games has recently led to claims that violent video games increase aggression effects in adolescents, and that this issue has now been settled. However, other researchers have found either no detrimental effects from game playing or even positive (cathartic) effects. In this research we demonstrate that these different conclusions are not mutually exclusive and can be explained by the method of assessment and analytic techniques utilised. We had adolescents play a violent video game (Quake II) and took measurements of anger both before, during and after game play. The results demonstrated that some people increase, some decrease and the majority show no change in anger ratings. Unlike past research, we also demonstrate that these changes are mediated by the player's feelings immediately prior to game play and a labile temperament – one predisposed to aggression – and that these variables predict people's reactions with an average 73% concordance rate.",doi,10.1080/10683160601060655,anderson2010,"Psychology, Crime, & Law","Unsworth, G., Devilly, G.

,The Effect Of Subjective And Physiological Arousal On Dishabituation Of Salivation,"We have previously shown that salivation to the same food habituates, and recovers after presenting novel nontaste stimuli. This study assessed the effects of environmental stimuli that differentially influence subjective and autonomic arousal on dishabituation of salivation. Thirty female subjects were preloaded on a lemon yogurt milkshake and habituated to seven presentations of lemon juice. Prior to the eighth presentation of juice, subjects were presented an engaging video game designed to produce subjective but no autonomic arousal (LO), a video game plus mental arithmetic stressor, designed to produce both subjective and physiological arousal (HI), or a no stimuli (REST) control. Significant dishabituating effects of HI versus REST were shown for salivation. Heart rate was significantly higher during the dishabituator for HI than LO or REST conditions, which were equal. Finally, significant differences in arousal were shown between each of the three conditions. These results show salivation can be differentially dishabituated by nonfood stimuli, and these stimuli influence salivation without influencing subjective hunger or hedonics. © 1993.",doi,10.1016/0031-9384(93)90158-C,Scopus,Physiology and Behavior,"Epstein L.H., Mitchell S.L., Caggiula A.R.",1993,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,The Effect Of Video Games On Feelings Of Aggression.,"Fueled by the media, the controversy over whether playing popular arcade/computer games increases aggressiveness has only been compounded by inconsistencies within empirical research. This experiment, conducted with university students in Scotland, was designed to explore some of these inconsistencies. Aggressiveness was manipulated as the independent variable. As dependent variables, the Buss-Durkee Hostility Inventory (Buss & Durkee, 1957) and the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ; Eysenck & Eysenck, 1975) were used. There was no linear pattern in aggressive affect change across three games that contained varying levels of violence. Results are discussed in terms of the general lack of support for the commonly held view that playing aggressive computer games causes an individual to feel more aggressive.",doi,10.1080/00223980.1995.9914952,anderson2010,Journal of Psychology,"Scott, D.",1995,NA,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,The Effects Of Nursing Interventions Utilizing Serious Games That Promote Health Activities On The Health Behaviors Of Seniors,"Objectives: Seniors, during their senescence, experience difficulties when engaging in physical, social, and leisure activities. Meanwhile, increased access to information technology in recent years among seniors has led to the increased applicability of games aiding senior activities that incorporate information technology. In this study, we constructed and assessed a nursing intervention incorporating an actual walking exercise game developed for the use of seniors in order to identify the cognitive, social, and physical impact it has on their health behaviors. Subjects and Method: This quasi-experimental study used a one-group pre-/post-test design in which 15 people 65 years of age or older were selected to participate through a serious health game conducted at the senior welfare center twice a week, for 12 weeks. Besides having their basic physical measurements taken, seniors participated in physical exercise sessions that included educational content. The measured variables were health beliefs and concerns, subjective knowledge, subjective norms, perceived reliability, perceived ease of use and usefulness, perceived behavioral control, attitudes about health behaviors, intentions to perform health behaviors, health behaviors, blood pressure, pulse rate, endurance, agility and balance, and flexibility. Results: Significant increases in health beliefs and concerns, perceived reliability, perceived behavioral control, perceived ease of use, attitudes about health behaviors, and intentions to perform health behaviors were observed at post-test, compared with pre-test data points. These increases were also recorded for physical domains. Significant increases in systolic blood pressure and pulse rates were noted immediately after the intervention, along with increased endurance levels, indicating that the exercise had an effect on participants' health. Conclusions: Ongoing research is required regarding the development and impact of distinctive nursing interventions, conducted through various forms of serious health games relatively easy to use, by integrating various motivating factors for engaging in health behaviors and the entertainment value of such games. © Copyright 2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2015.",doi,10.1089/g4h.2014.0124,Scopus,Games for Health Journal,"Lee H.-Y., Kim J., Kim K.S.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,"The Effects Of Violent Video Game Habits On Adolescent Hostility, Aggressive Behaviors, And School Performance.","Video games have become one of the favorite activities of American children. A growing body of research is linking violent video game play to aggressive cognitions, attitudes, and behaviors. The first goal of this study was to document the video games habits of adolescents and the level of parental monitoring of adolescent video game use. The second goal was to examine associations among violent video game exposure, hostility, arguments with teachers, school grades, and physical fights. In addition, path analyses were conducted to test mediational pathways from video game habits to outcomes. Six hundred and seven 8th- and 9th-grade students from four schools participated. Adolescents who expose themselves to greater amounts of video game violence were more hostile, reported getting into arguments with teachers more frequently, were more likely to be involved in physical fights, and performed more poorly in school. Mediational pathways were found such that hostility mediated the relationship between violent video game exposure and outcomes.

,The Future Of Weather Forecasting,"The Met Office, Britain, currently takes in 106 million observations a day from weather balloons, satellites and commercial aeroplanes around the world. Its existing supercomputer then integrates the weather observations into modeling software to predict the world's weather. The office currently uses an IBM POWER7, a 1.2 -petaflop machine. The new supercomputer is a 16-petaflop Cray XC40. It will have two million gigabytes of memory available to run calculations the equivalent of 120,000 smartphones. There will be over 17 million gigabytes of storage capacity. It will run at speeds of more than 1.5 terabytes bandwidth and use 480,000 cores, that's more processing power than 100,000 PlayStation 4 games consoles. With the new computer, the Met Office hopes to run 1.5km forecasts every hour. Forecasters will be able to zoom in on particular regions to produce detailed local forecasts down to 300m resolution, which is useful for predicting localized weather conditions like fog at airports, strong winds, and heavy snowfall. Met Office experts will also be able to analyze data once an hour rather than the current six hours, and give forecasts six days ahead instead of four. The computer will enable them to calculate temperatures for the next 24 hours with up to 90 per cent accuracy. The Met Office also believes the computer will help scientists make more accurate climate change predictions and will facilitate forward-looking climate simulations and models that better assess how climate change will affect weather systems.",doi,10.1049/et.2015.0207,Scopus,Engineering and Technology,Andrews C.,2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,The Impact Of Prolonged Violent Video-Gaming On Adolescent Sleep: An Experimental Study,"Video-gaming is an increasingly prevalent activity among children and adolescents that is known to influence several areas of emotional, cognitive and behavioural functioning. Currently there is insufficient experimental evidence about how extended video-game play may affect adolescents' sleep. The aim of this study was to investigate the shortterm impact of adolescents' prolonged exposure to violent video-gaming on sleep. Seventeen male adolescents (mean age = 16 ± 1 years) with no current sleep difficulties played a novel, fast-paced, violent videogame (50 or 150 min) before their usual bedtime on two different testing nights in a sleep laboratory. Objective (polysomnography-measured sleep and heart rate) and subjective (single-night sleep diary) measures were obtained to assess the arousing effects of prolonged gaming. Compared with regular gaming, prolonged gaming produced decreases in objective sleep efficiency (by 7 ± 2%, falling below 85%) and total sleep time (by 27 ± 12 min) that was contributed by a near-moderate reduction in rapid eye movement sleep (Cohen's d = 0.48). Subjective sleep-onset latency significantly increased by 17 ± 8 min, and there was a moderate reduction in self-reported sleep quality after prolonged gaming (Cohen's d = 0.53). Heart rate did not differ significantly between video-gaming conditions during pre-sleep game-play or the sleep-onset phase. Results provide evidence that prolonged video-gaming may cause clinically significant disruption to adolescent sleep, even when sleep after video-gaming is initiated at normal bedtime. However, physiological arousal may not necessarily be the mechanism by which technology use affects sleep. © 2012 European Sleep Research Society.",doi,10.1111/j.1365-2869.2012.01060.x,Scopus,Journal of Sleep Research,"King D.L., Gradisar M., Drummond A., Lovato N., Wessel J., Micic G., Douglas P., Delfabbro P.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,The Impact Of Social Exclusion Vs. Inclusion On Subjective And Hormonal Reactions In Females And Males,"Background: The experience of social exclusion represents an extremely aversive and threatening situation in daily life. The present study examined the impact of social exclusion compared to inclusion on steroid hormone concentrations as well as on subjective affect ratings. Methods: Eighty subjects (40 females) participated in two independent behavioral experiments. They engaged in a computerized ball tossing game in which they ostensibly played with two other players who deliberately excluded or included them, respectively. Hormone samples as well as mood ratings were taken before and after the game. Results: Social exclusion led to a decrease in positive mood ratings and increased anger ratings. In contrast, social inclusion did not affect positive mood ratings, but decreased sadness ratings. Both conditions did not affect cortisol levels. Testosterone significantly decreased after being excluded in both genders, and increased after inclusion, but only in males. Interestingly, progesterone showed an increase after both conditions only in females. Discussion: Our results suggest that social exclusion does not trigger a classical stress response but gender-specific changes in sex hormone levels. The testosterone decrease after being excluded in both genders, as well as the increase after inclusion in males can be interpreted within the framework of the biosocial status hypothesis. The progesterone increase might reflect a generalized affiliative response during social interaction in females. © 2013 The Authors.",doi,10.1016/j.psyneuen.2013.07.021,Scopus,Psychoneuroendocrinology,"Seidel E.M., Silani G., Metzler H., Thaler H., Lamm C., Gur R.C., Kryspin-Exner I., Habel U., Derntl B.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma: Early Experiences With Learning Classifier System-Based Simple Agents,"Prior research on artificial agents/agencies involves entities using specifically tailored operational strategies (e.g., for information retrieval, purchase negotiation). In some situations, however, an agent must interact with others whose strategies are initially unknown and whose interests may counter its own. In such circumstances, pre-defining effective counter-strategies could become difficult or impractical. One solution, which may be viable in certain contexts, is to create agents that self-evolve increasingly effective strategies from rudimentary beginnings, during actual deployment. Using the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) problem as a generic agent-interaction setting, we use the Learning Classifier System (LCS) paradigm to construct autonomously adapting ""simple"" agents. A simple agent attempts to cope by maintaining an evolving but potentially perennially incomplete and imperfect knowledge base. These agents operate against specifically tailored (non-adaptive) agents. We present a preliminary suite of simulation experiments and results. The promise evidenced leads us to articulate several additional areas of interesting investigations that we are pursuing. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

,The Neural Mechanisms Of Affect Infusion In Social Economic Decision-Making: A Mediating Role Of The Anterior Insula,"Though emotions have been shown to have sometimes dramatic effects on decision-making, the neural mechanisms mediating these biases are relatively unexplored. Here, we investigated how incidental affect (i.e. emotional states unrelated to the decision at hand) may influence decisions, and how these biases are implemented in the brain. Nineteen adult participants made decisions which involved accepting or rejecting monetary offers from others in an Ultimatum Game while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Prior to each set of decisions, participants watched a short video clip aimed at inducing either a sad or neutral emotional state. Results demonstrated that, as expected, sad participants rejected more unfair offers than those in the neutral condition. Neuroimaging analyses revealed that receiving unfair offers while in a sad mood elicited activity in brain areas related to aversive emotional states and somatosensory integration (anterior insula) and to cognitive conflict (anterior cingulate cortex). Sad participants also showed a diminished sensitivity in neural regions associated with reward processing (ventral striatum). Importantly, insular activation uniquely mediated the relationship between sadness and decision bias. This study is the first to reveal how subtle mood states can be integrated at the neural level to influence decision-making. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",doi,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.02.027,Scopus,NeuroImage,"Harlé K.M., Chang L.J., van 't Wout M., Sanfey A.G.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,The Promise Of Exergames As Tools To Measure Physical Health,"Exergames are popular video games that combine physical activity with digital gaming. To measure effects of exergame play on physical outcomes and health behaviors, most studies use external measures including accelerometry, indirect calorimetry, heart rate monitors, and written surveys. These measures may reduce external validity by burdening participants during gameplay. Many exergames have the capability to measure activity levels unobtrusively through monitors built into game equipment, and preliminary analysis indicates that exergame measures are significantly correlated with external measures of caloric expenditure, duration of play, and balance. Exergames also have unique capabilities to measure additional data, such as the game challenges, player movement, and levels of performance that affect aerobic activity. Researchers could capitalize on the data collected by the exergame itself, providing an efficient, unobtrusive, comprehensive measure of physical activity during exergame play. © 2011 International Federation for Information Processing.",doi,10.1016/j.entcom.2011.03.008,Scopus,Entertainment Computing,"Staiano A.E., Calvert S.L.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,The Psychophysiology Of James Bond: Phasic Emotional Responses To Violent Video Game Events,"The authors examined emotional valence- and arousal-related phasic psychophysiological responses to different violent events in the first-person shooter video game ""James Bond 007: NightFire"" among 36 young adults. Event-related changes in zygomaticus major, corrugator supercilii, and orbicularis oculi electromyographic (EMG) activity and skin conductance level (SCL) were recorded, and the participants rated their emotions and the trait psychoticism based on the Psychoticism dimension of the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised, Short Form. Wounding and killing the opponent elicited an increase in SCL and a decrease in zygomatic and orbicularis oculi EMG activity. The decrease in zygomatic and orbicularis oculi activity was less pronounced among high Psychoticism scorers compared with low Psychoticism scorers. The wounding and death of the player's own character (James Bond) elicited an increase in SCL and zygomatic and orbicularis oculi EMG activity and a decrease in corrugator activity. Instead of joy resulting from victory and success, wounding and killing the opponent may elicit high-arousal negative affect (anxiety), with high Psychoticism scorers experiencing less anxiety than low Psychoticism scorers. Although counterintuitive, the wounding and death of the player's own character may increase some aspect of positive emotion. © 2008 American Psychological Association.",doi,10.1037/1528-3542.8.1.114,Scopus,Emotion,"Ravaja N., Turpeinen M., Saari T., Puttonen S., Keltikangas-Järvinen L.",2008,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,"The Relation Of Flow-Experience And Physiological Arousal Under Stress — Can U Shape It? Journal Of Experimental Social Psychology, 53, 62–69.","In this study, we investigate the relationship between stress and flow-experience with the help of psychophysiological arousal indicators. Whereas recent studies suggest a positive relation between flow and physiological arousal, so far nothing is known on the relation between flow and high arousal in response to a salient stressor. We here suggest that the relation of flow with sympathetic arousal and hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis activation follows an inverted u-curve rather than a linear function: moderate physiological arousal should facilitate flow-experience, whereas excessive physiological arousal should hinder flow. In order to experimentally stimulate high physiological arousal, we exposed 22 healthy male participants to a modified version of the Trier Social Stress Test. Then, participants had to perform a complex computer task for 60 minutes and to rate their flow-experience on the Flow Short-Scale directly after task completion. During the experiment, cortisol samples were taken every 15 minutes, and heart rate variability measures were assessed by continuous electrocardiography. We found an inverted u-shaped relationship of flow-experience with indices of sympathetic arousal and cortisol, whereas parasympathetic indices of heart rate control during stress were linearly and positively correlated with flow-experience. Our results suggest that moderate sympathetic arousal and HPA-axis activation and possibly a co-activation of both branches of the autonomic nervous system characterize task-related flow experience.",doi,10.1016/j.jesp.2014.01.009,nagy2015,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,"Peifer, C., Schulz, A., Schächinger, H., Baumann, N., Antoni, C.

,The Role Of Human-Automation Consensus In Multiple Unmanned Vehicle Scheduling,"Objective: This study examined the impact of increasing automation replanning rates on operator performance and workload when supervising a decentralized network of heterogeneous unmanned vehicles. Background: Futuristic unmanned vehicles systems will invert the operator-to-vehicle ratio so that one operator can control multiple dissimilar vehicles connected through a decentralized network. Significant human-automation collaboration will be needed because of automation brittleness, but such collaboration could cause high workload. Method: Three increasing levels of replanning were tested on an existing multiple unmanned vehicle simulation environment that leverages decentralized algorithms for vehicle routing and task allocation in conjunction with human supervision. Results: Rapid replanning can cause high operator workload, ultimately resulting in poorer overall system performance. Poor performance was associated with a lack of operator consensus for when to accept the automations suggested prompts for new plan consideration as well as negative attitudes toward unmanned aerial vehicles in general. Participants with video game experience tended to collaborate more with the automation, which resulted in better performance. Conclusion: In decentralized unmanned vehicle networks, operators who ignore the automations requests for new plan consideration and impose rapid replans both increase their own workload and reduce the ability of the vehicle network to operate at its maximum capacity. Application: These findings have implications for personnel selection and training for futuristic systems involving human collaboration with decentralized algorithms embedded in networks of autonomous systems. © 2010, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.",doi,10.1177/0018720810368674,Scopus,Human Factors,"Cummings M.L., Clare A., Hart C.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,The Standardized Mental Stress Test Protocol: Test‐Retest Reliability And Comparison With Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring,"The mental stress test protocol is used extensively in research, but different laboratories often employ different stress tasks, utilize different dependent variables to index the stress response, and perform different transformations on the gathered data. The present study determined the test‐retest reliability of 11 cardiovascular dependent variables during a resting baseline and three common stress tasks: playing a video game, performing a choice reaction‐time test, and performing a cold‐pressor test. Sixty healthy, middle‐aged males underwent testing twice, approximately three months apart. Instructions were delivered via videotape and data were gathered on‐line by computer to ensure a standard laboratory environment. Each task elicited significant increases in blood pressure, vascular rigidity, LVET, heart rate, and stroke volume. In addition, the cold‐pressor test led to increases in total systemic resistance and mean systolic ejection rate. The absolute levels of the 11 dependent variables were correlated across tasks (partial r, baseline removed, = .06 to .69, 32 of 33 comparisons significant at p<.05), indicating that reactivity to stress generalizes across alternate test forms. The absolute levels also showed significant test‐retest reliability (r= .32 to .82; 40 of 44 comparisons significant at p<.05). In addition, for 19 of 33 comparisons, absolute levels showed greater test‐retest reliability than change scores derived by subtracting the initial resting baseline value from the stress‐task value. Finally, blood pressures taken during the stress tests were more highly correlated with the average blood pressures measured via ambulatory monitoring than casual office pressures, suggesting that such stress values may more accurately reflect average blood pressure.

,Time Spent On The Internet And Adolescent Blood Pressure,"Internet use is nearly ubiquitous among adolescents. Growing evidence suggests heavy Internet use negatively impacts health, yet the relationship between time spent on the Internet and adolescent blood pressure (BP) is unknown. We examined the association between Internet use and elevated BP in a racially diverse cross-sectional sample of 331 healthy adolescents (ages 14-17 years). Heavy Internet use was defined as ≥ 2 hr/day, moderate use as <2 hr/day and ≥ 5 days/week, and light use as <2 hr/day and ≤ 4 days/week. Elevated BP was defined as systolic or diastolic BP ≥ 90th percentile. Heavy Internet users had statistically significantly higher odds of elevated BP compared to light Internet users. School nurses can play an important role in preventing high BP through assessment of BP and other health behaviors including Internet use, and health teaching to individuals, student groups, faculty, and parents to increase awareness of the relationship between Internet use and health. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014.",doi,10.1177/1059840514556772,Scopus,Journal of School Nursing,"Cassidy-Bushrow A.E., Johnson D.A., Peters R.M., Burmeister C., Joseph C.L.M.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Towards Sdn Based Queuing Delay Estimation,"As one of QoS (Quality of Service) metrics, delay is critical important to delay sensitive applications, such as interactive video, network game and online surgery.

,Towards The Design And Implementation Of Computer-Modeled Opponents For Use In Entertainment And Educational Software: Some Initial Considerations,"While advances in computer technology have led to major improvements in the presentation and appearance of modern computer games, there has been no equivalent improvement in the artificial intelligence (AI) performance of these games. Traditional AI designs have had surprisingly little impact on the development of game-based intelligent systems. New approaches to AI, particularly those using autonomous software agents encapsulated in software robots (softbots), have the potential to make an enormous impact on game-based AI systems. Softbot-based autonomous software agents provide a framework capable of supporting psychologically based models of human behavior in a game environment. Used in this manner, softbots provide a new set of tools to explore the synthesis of human-like reasoning in complex and dynamic environments. This paper explores some initial attempts to develop an exploratory, game-based, experimental environment capable of hosting softbot-based, psychological models of human behavior. Some preliminary work in the design and implementation of a simple, extensible, softbot-based, computer-modeled opponent is also discussed. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.",doi,10.1016/S0747-5632(97)80003-9,Scopus,Computers in Human Behavior,Cressy C.J.,1997,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Trait And State Emotion Congruence In Simulated Casinos: Effects On At-Risk Gambling Intention And Restoration,"This research examined the effects of casino design and congruence in trait and state emotion on at-risk gambling intentions and psychological restoration. Video simulations representing two casino designs (playground vs. gaming) were presented to 484 participants (241 males) varying in gambling sub-type. The playground design features a recognizable theme, elements of nature, and spaciousness; the gaming design focuses on the gambling machines in a maze-like setting with low ceilings. For low trait arousal participants, at-risk intentions were higher when environmental arousal (EA) was high (mismatch) than when low (match). For high trait arousal participants, at-risk intentions were higher when EA was high (match) than when low (mismatch). A similar pattern of results occurred for restoration but only for pleasure trait-state congruency in non-problem gamblers. For problem gamblers, the effects of trait-state congruence on restoration were restricted to those with low trait pleasure for the playground design. The effects of congruence in trait and state emotion are bounded by the positivity of the outcome (at-risk gambling intention vs. restoration), the design of the casino (playground vs. gaming), the dimension of emotion (arousal vs. pleasure), the pole of the emotion (low vs. high), and gambler subtype (problem vs. non-problem).

,Tryptophan Enhancement/Depletion And Reactions To Failure On A Cooperative Computer Game,"Twenty-eight high trait hostility male volunteers played a 'cooperative' computer game 4.5 hours after an amino acid drink enhanced with, or depleted of, tryptophan. Each trial involved steering a tank through minefields following directions from an unknown 'partner.' Failure was experienced when the tank hit a mine or when time ran out. Subjects' moods, verbal aggression, attributions of blame, vocal acoustics, and blood pressure were assessed. Differences between tryptophan groups were not significant for primary measures of anger and verbal aggression. However, depleted subjects reported greater increases in feelings of restlessness and incompetence, were less successful in avoiding mines and showed greater increases in blood pressure during the game. Subjects in both groups sent more negative ratings when they lost the game by virtue of hitting a mine rather than losing by running out of time. However, ratings of the depleted group were less influenced by the reason for losing the game. Also, vocal acoustics showed a group x reason- for-losing interaction in the high-frequency band. Tryptophan-depleted subjects with high scores on Behavioral-Activation-System-Drive were most likely to send negative ratings and those scoring high on Buss-Durkee Hostility Inventory Assault and Guilt to report increased anger after the game.",doi,10.1016/S0893-133X(99)00078-0,Scopus,Neuropsychopharmacology,"Wingrove J., Bond A.J., Cleare A.J.",1999,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,"Understanding The Relationship Between Exergame Play Experiences, Enjoyment, And Intentions For Continued Play","Objective: Although it is generally understood that exergames can be beneficial, more research is needed to understand how in-game experiences influence enjoyment and the likelihood for continued use of these types of games. Therefore, the objective of this research is to understand how player performance in an exergame affects psychological responses (autonomy, competence, and presence), enjoyment of the experience, and likelihood for future play. Subjects and Methods: Sixty-two college students (mean age, 20.32 years) participated in an experiment where they played a challenge event on the ""Biggest Loser"" exergame for the Nintendo (Kyoto, Japan) Wii™ console. Participants were given up to two chances to see if they could ""win"" the challenge event. A lab assistant recorded player performance for each session in minutes and seconds (range, 30 seconds-10 minutes). The attempt in which the participant achieved the greatest amount of time playing was used as a measure of player performance. After playing, subjects filled out a questionnaire with items pertaining to enjoyment, competence, autonomy, presence, and future intentions for continued use of the exergame. Results: The results suggest that player achievement (longer time spent playing) directly and indirectly predicts feelings of autonomy, competence, presence, enjoyment, and future intentions to play. Individuals who performed better felt more autonomous and experienced greater presence, leading to greater enjoyment. Enjoyment and presence were found to mediate the relationship between player performance and future intentions to play an exergame. Conclusions: This study suggests that performance in exergames is related to psychological experiences that fuel enjoyment and the likelihood for future exergame use.

,"Using ""Human State Aware"" Robots To Enhance Physical Human-Robot Interaction In A Cooperative Scenario","Human motor performance, speed and variability are highly susceptible to emotional states. This paper reviews the impact of the emotions on the motor control performance, and studies the possibility of improving the perceived skill/challenge relation on a multimodal neural rehabilitation scenario, by means of a biocybernetic controller that modulates the assistance provided by a haptic controlled robot in reaction to undesirable physical and mental states.

,Using A Computer Game To Develop Advanced Al,"In computer games, designers can use artificial intelligence to control individual characters, provide strategic direction to character groups, dynamically change parameters to make the game appropriately challenging, or produce play-by-play commentary. Computer games offer an inexpensive, reliable, and surprisingly accessible environment for conducting research in human-level AI design, often - as in the case of Quake II - with built-in AI interfaces. The author's work with the game's Quakebot demonstrated that researchers can successfully pursue serious study of autonomous AI agents within the context of computer games. This research directly applies to computer-generated forces, which require modeling realistic, entity-level behavior. Studying the impact of changes in reaction time, tactics level, and perceptual and motor skills on overall Quake II game performance helped to model these behaviors. From its scoring method, which rewards the highest number of kills, it's obvious that Quake II epitomizes violent computer games. The author does not, however, believe that the future of AI in games lies in creating ever more realistic arenas for violence. Thus, he is pursuing further research within the context of creating computer games that emphasize the drama that arises from social interactions between humans and computer characters.",doi,10.1109/2.933506,Scopus,Computer,Laird J.E.,2001,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Using A Serious Game To Complement Cpr Instruction In A Nurse Faculty,"Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a first aid key survival technique used to stimulate breathing and keep blood flowing to the heart. Its effective administration can significantly increase the chances of survival for victims of cardiac arrest. LISSA is a serious game designed to complement CPR teaching and also to refresh CPR skills in an enjoyable way. The game presents an emergency situation in a 3D virtual environment and the player has to save the victim applying the CPR actions. In this paper, we describe LISSA and its evaluation in a population composed of 109 nursing undergraduate students enrolled in the Nursing degree of our university. To evaluate LISSA we performed a randomized controlled trial that compares the classical teaching methodology, composed of self-directed learning for theory plus laboratory sessions with a mannequin for practice, with the one that uses LISSA after self-directed learning for theory and before laboratory sessions with a mannequin. From our evaluation we observed that students using LISSA (Group 2 and 3) gave significantly better learning acquisition scores than those following traditional classes (Group 1). To evaluate the differences between students of these groups we performed a paired samples t-test between Group 1 and 2 (μ1=35, 67, μ2=47, 50 and p&lt;0.05) and between students of Group 1 and 3 (μ1=35, 67, μ3=50, 58 and p&lt;0.05). From these tests we observed that there are significant differences in both cases. We also evaluated student performance of main steps of CPR protocol. Students that use LISSA performed better than the ones that did not use it. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.cmpb.2015.08.006,Scopus,Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine,"Boada I., Rodriguez-Benitez A., Garcia-Gonzalez J.M., Olivet J., Carreras V., Sbert M.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Using Cognitive Dissonance To Induce Adolescents' Escaping From The Claw Of Online Gaming: The Roles Of Personal Responsibility And Justification Of Cost,"The negative impact of the Internet on adolescents has received much attention. How to reduce their pathological use of online gaming is also a critical issue. Based on cognitive dissonance theory, two experiments were conducted to examine whether personal responsibility and justification of cost may play crucial factors in impacting adolescent players' attitude change and their willingness to engage in attitude-discrepant behavior. The results of Experiment 1 revealed that adolescent players who felt a strong sense of responsibility appeared to exhibit greater attitude change. In Experiment 2, the findings indicated that players tended to employ justification of cost in order to reduce or eliminate the dissonance between their attitude toward online gaming and invested cost. Adolescent players who perceived a higher cost in online gaming were less willing to engage in attitude-discrepant behavior. Reducing adolescents ' overuse of online gaming can be appreciated through the perspective of cognitive dissonance. © 2007 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",doi,10.1089/cpb.2007.9972,Scopus,Cyberpsychology and Behavior,"Chiou W.-B., Wan C.-S.",2007,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Using Multiple Data Sources To Get Closer Insights Into User Cost And Task Performance,"This pilot study explores the use of combining multiple data sources (subjective, physical, physiological, and eye tracking) in understanding user cost and behavior. Specifically, we show the efficacy of such objective measurements as heart rate variability (HRV), and pupillary response in evaluating user cost in game environments, along with subjective techniques, and investigate eye and hand behavior at various levels of user cost. In addition, a method for evaluating task performance at the micro-level is developed by combining eye and hand data. Four findings indicate the great potential value of combining multiple data sources to evaluate interaction: first, spectral analysis of HRV in the low frequency band shows significant sensitivity to changes in user cost, modulated by game difficulty-the result is consistent with subjective ratings, but pupillary response fails to accord with user cost in this game environment; second, eye saccades seem to be more sensitive to user cost changes than eye fixation number and duration, or scanpath length; third, a composite index based on eye and hand movements is developed, and it shows more sensitivity to user cost changes than a single eye or hand measurement; finally, timeline analysis of the ratio of eye fixations to mouse clicks demonstrates task performance changes and learning effects over time. We conclude that combining multiple data sources has a valuable role in human-computer interaction (HCI) evaluation and design. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

,Using Physiological Models And Decision Theory For Selecting Appropriate Ventilator Settings,"Objective: To present a decision support system for optimising mechanical ventilation in patients residing in the intensive care unit. Methods: Mathematical models of oxygen transport, carbon dioxide transport and lung mechanics are combined with penalty functions describing clinical preference toward the goals and side-effects of mechanical ventilation in a decision theoretic approach. Penalties are quantified for risk of lung barotrauma, acidosis or alkalosis, oxygen toxicity or absorption atelectasis, and hypoxaemia. Results: The systemis presented with an example of its use in a post-surgical patient. The mathematical models describe the patient's data, and the system suggests an optimal ventilator strategy in line with clinical practice. Conclusions: The system illustrates how mathematical models combined with decision theory can aid in the difficult compromises necessary when deciding on ventilator settings. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2006.",doi,10.1007/s10877-006-9049-5,Scopus,Journal of Clinical Monitoring and Computing,"Rees S.E., Allerød C., Murley D., Zhao Y., Smith B.W., Kjærgaard S., Thorgaard P., Andreassen S.",2006,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia

,Validation Of The Angular Measurements Of A New Inertial-Measurement-Unit Based Rehabilitation System: Comparison With State-Of-The-Art Gait Analysis,"Background: Several rehabilitation systems based on inertial measurement units (IMU) are entering the market for the control of exercises and to measure performance progression, particularly for recovery after lower limb orthopaedic treatments. IMU are easy to wear also by the patient alone, but the extent to which IMU's malpositioning in routine use can affect the accuracy of the measurements is not known. A new such system (Riablo™, CoRehab, Trento, Italy), using audio-visual biofeedback based on videogames, was assessed against state-of-the-art gait analysis as the gold standard.Methods. The sensitivity of the system to errors in the IMU's position and orientation was measured in 5 healthy subjects performing two hip joint motion exercises. Root mean square deviation was used to assess differences in the system's kinematic output between the erroneous and correct IMU position and orientation.In order to estimate the system's accuracy, thorax and knee joint motion of 17 healthy subjects were tracked during the execution of standard rehabilitation tasks and compared with the corresponding measurements obtained with an established gait protocol using stereophotogrammetry.Results: A maximum mean error of 3.1 ± 1.8 deg and 1.9 ± 0.8 deg from the angle trajectory with correct IMU position was recorded respectively in the medio-lateral malposition and frontal-plane misalignment tests. Across the standard rehabilitation tasks, the mean distance between the IMU and gait analysis systems was on average smaller than 5°.Conclusions: These findings showed that the tested IMU based system has the necessary accuracy to be safely utilized in rehabilitation programs after orthopaedic treatments of the lower limb. © 2014 Leardini et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",doi,10.1186/1743-0003-11-136,Scopus,Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation,"Leardini A., Lullini G., Giannini S., Berti L., Ortolani M., Caravaggi P.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia

Studies 1 and 2 suggest that females experience greater presence and more aggressive thoughts from game play when a gender match between self and game character exists. Studies 2 and 3 indicate that playing against a human opponent (rather than a computer) increases aggressive thoughts. Finally, although Studies 1, 2, and 3 indicate that playing as a female against a male opponent increases aggressive thoughts, Studies 1 and 2 suggest that playing as a male against a female opponent consistently and significantly decreases aggressive thoughts.",doi,10.1111/j.1468-2958.2006.00279.x,anderson2010,Human Communication Research,"Eastin, M.",2006,NA,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,"Video Games And Aggressive Thoughts, Feelings, And Behavior In The Laboratory And In Life.","Two studies examined violent video game effects on aggression-related variables. Study 1 found that real-life violent video game play was positively related to aggressive behavior and delinquency. The relation was stronger for individuals who are characteristically aggressive and for men. Academic achievement was negatively related to overall amount of time spent playing video games. In Study 2, laboratory exposure to a graphically violent video game increased aggressive thoughts and behavior. In both studies, men had a more hostile view of the world than did women. The results from both studies are consistent with the General Affective Aggression Model, which predicts that exposure to violent video games will increase aggressive behavior in both the short term (e.g., laboratory aggression) and the long term (e.g., delinquency).

,Video Material And Epilepsy,"Summary: Nine patients who had epileptic attacks while playing computer games were studied in the laboratory. Patients had an EEG recorded as well as their response to intermittent photic stimulation (IPS) at flash rates of 1–60 fps. In addition, pattern sensitivity was assessed in all patients by a gratings pattern. Only 2 patients had no previous history of convulsions, and only 2 had a normal basic EEG. All but 1 were sensitive to IPS, and all but 1 were pattern sensitive. Most patients were male, but although this appears to conflict with previously published literature results regarding the sex ratio in photosensitivity, it was due to the male predominance of video game usage. We compared our results with those reported in the literature. Diagnosing video game epilepsy requires performing an EEG with IPS and pattern stimulation. We propose a standard method of testing.

,Violent Video Game Play Impacts Facial Emotion Recognition,"This study assessed the speed of recognition of facial emotional expressions (happy and angry) as a function of violent video game play. Color photos of calm facial expressions morphed to either an angry or a happy facial expression. Participants were asked to make a speeded identification of the emotion (happiness or anger) during the morph. Typically, happy faces are identified faster than angry faces (the happy-face advantage). Results indicated that playing a violent video game led to a reduction in the happy face advantage. Implications of these findings are discussed with respect to the current models of aggressive behavior. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",doi,10.1002/ab.20191,Scopus,Aggressive Behavior,"Kirsh S.J., Mounts J.R.W.",2007,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Violent Video Game Players And Non-Players Differ On Facial Emotion Recognition,"Violent video game playing has been associated with both positive and negative effects on cognition. We examined whether playing two or more hours of violent video games a day, compared to not playing video games, was associated with a different pattern of recognition of five facial emotions, while controlling for general perceptual and cognitive differences that might also occur. Undergraduate students were categorized as violent video game players (n=83) or non-gamers (n=69) and completed a facial recognition task, consisting of an emotion recognition condition and a control condition of gender recognition. Additionally, participants completed questionnaires assessing their video game and media consumption, aggression, and mood. Violent video game players recognized fearful faces both more accurately and quickly and disgusted faces less accurately than non-gamers. Desensitization to violence, constant exposure to fear and anxiety during game playing, and the habituation to unpleasant stimuli, are possible mechanisms that could explain these results. Future research should evaluate the effects of violent video game playing on emotion processing and social cognition more broadly. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",doi,10.1002/ab.21602,Scopus,Aggressive Behavior,"Diaz R.L., Wong U., Hodgins D.C., Chiu C.G., Goghari V.M.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia

This article reports an experiment designed to test key hypotheses concerning the short term impact of exposure to violent video games on young women, a population that has received relatively little attention in this research literature. Results were that brief exposure to a violent video game increased aggressive behavior. Mediational analyses suggested that the violent video game effect on aggression was not mediated by instrumental aggressive motivation, but was partially mediated by revenge motivation.

,Violent Video Games And Anger As Predictors Of Aggression.,"Considerable research has demonstrated that playing violent video games can increase aggression. The theoretical framework upon which a good deal of this research has rested is known as the General Aggression Model (GAM; [Anderson, C. A., & Bushman, B. J. (2002). Human aggression. Annual Review of Psychology, 53, 27–51]). The current study tested an assumption of the GAM by examining if the dispositional trait of anger moderated the relation between violent video games and aggression. A total of 167 undergraduate students (79 females, 88 males) first completed a measure of anger and were then randomly assigned to play either a non-violent or violent video game. After the video game play period, participants completed ambiguous story stems in order to assess aggression. Consistent with predictions of the GAM, anger significantly moderated the effect of video game violence on aggression. Specifically, participants who were angry were more affected by violent video games than participants who were not angry.",doi,10.1016/j.jrp.2007.02.005,anderson2010,Journal of Research in Personality,"Giumetti, G.

,Violent Video Games And Hostile Expectations: A Test Of The General Aggression Model.,"Research conducted over several decades has shown that violent media increase aggression. It is now time to move beyond the question of whether violent media increase aggression to answering the question why violent media increase aggression. The present research tested whether violent video games produce a hostile expectation bias—the tendency to expect others to react to potential conflicts with aggression. Participants (N = 224) played either a violent or nonviolent video game. Next, they read ambiguous story stems about potential interpersonal conflicts. They were asked what the main character will do, say, think, and feel as the story continues. People who played a violent video game described the main character as behaving more aggressively, thinking more aggressive thoughts, and feeling more angry than did people who played a nonviolent video game.

,Violent Video Games: Specific Effects Of Violent Content On Aggressive Thoughts And Behavior.,"This chapter presents three experimental studies, one correlational study, and a meta-analysis tested key hypotheses concerning the short-term and long-term impact of exposure to violent video games. Experiment 1 found that violent video games in general increase the accessibility of aggressive thoughts. Experiments 2 and 3 found that playing violent video games increased aggression, even when arousal and affect were controlled. Experiments 2 and 3 also found that trait hostility and trait aggression were positively related to laboratory aggression. Furthermore, there was correlational evidence of a link between repeated exposure to violent video games and trait aggressiveness. Mediational analyses suggested that the trait effects and the violent video game effects on laboratory aggression were partially mediated by revenge motivation. The correlational study uncovered links among habitual exposure to violent video games, persistent aggressive cognitions, and self-reported aggressive behavior. The meta-analyses revealed significant effects of violent video games on aggressive behavior, affect, and cognition; on cardiovascular arousal; and on prosocial behavior.",doi,10.1016/S0065-2601(04)36004-1,anderson2010,Advances in Experimental Social Psychology,"Anderson, C.

,Virtual Learning Environments For Culture And Intercultural Competence,"The authors review six virtual learning environments built to support the acquisition of cultural knowledge and communication skills: ATL, BiLAT, Croquelandia, Second China, TLCTS, and VECTOR. Each leverages modern 3D video game engine technology which allows high-fidelity simulation of new cultural settings, including representations of buildings, streets, art work, dress, voice, gestures, and more. To bring more realism to simulated cultural interactions, several of the systems are driven by artificial intelligence (AI) models of culture, communication, and emotion. Additionally, several rely on narrative-based techniques to place the target culture in context and enhance motivation of those using the systems.

,Virtual Reality As Means To Improve Physical Fitness Of Individuals At A Severe Level Of Intellectual And Developmental Disability,"Individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) are in need of effective and motivating physical fitness training programs. The aim was to test the effectiveness of a virtual reality (VR)-based exercise program in improving the physical fitness of adults with severe IDD when implemented by on-site caregivers. A research group (N= 20; mean age ± standard deviation = 47.9 ± 8.6 years; severe IDD level) was matched for age, IDD level and functional abilities with a comparison group (N= 24, mean age = 46.2 ± 9.3 years; severe IDD level). An 8-week fitness program consisting of 2-3 30-min sessions per week included game-like exercises provided by the IREX/GX video capture VR system. Changes in physical fitness were monitored by changes in heart rate at rest. A significant (P< 0.005) reduction in heart rate was demonstrated for the research group. No change in heart rate was monitored in the comparison group. Despite statistically significant improvements in heart rate, the results are not strong enough functionally to claim that this program improved physical fitness of individuals with severe intellectual disability. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.ridd.2010.01.010,Scopus,Research in Developmental Disabilities,"Lotan M., Yalon-Chamovitz S., Weiss P.L.T.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia

,What Does Touch Tell Us About Emotions In Touchscreen-Based Gameplay,"The increasing number of people playing games on touch-screen mobile phones raises the question of whether touch behaviors reflect players' emotional states. This prospect would not only be a valuable evaluation indicator for game designers, but also for real-time personalization of the game experience. Psychology studies on acted touch behavior show the existence of discriminative affective profiles. In this article, finger-stroke features during gameplay on an iPod were extracted and their discriminative power analyzed. Machine learning algorithms were used to build systems for automatically discriminating between four emotional states (Excited, Relaxed, Frustrated, Bored), two levels of arousal and two levels of valence. Accuracy reached between 69% and 77% for the four emotional states, and higher results (~89%) were obtained for discriminating between two levels of arousal and two levels of valence. We conclude by discussing the factors relevant to the generalization of the results to applications other than games. © 2012 ACM.",doi,10.1145/2395131.2395138,Scopus,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,"Gao Y., Bianchi-Berthouze N., Meng H.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,What Is The Identity Of A Sports Spectator?,"Despite the prominence of sports in contemporary society, little is known about the identity and personality traits of sports spectators. With a sample of 293 individuals, we examine four broad categories of factors that may explain variability in the reported amount of time spent watching sports. Using individual difference regression techniques, we explore the relationship between sports spectating and physiological measures (e.g., testosterone and cortisol), clinical self-report scales (ADHD and autism), personality traits (e.g., NEO ""Big Five""), and pastime activities (e.g., video game playing). Our results indicate that individuals who report higher levels of sports spectating tend to have higher levels of extraversion, and in particular excitement seeking and gregariousness. These individuals also engage more in complementary pastime activities, including participating in sports and exercise activities, watching TV/movies, and playing video games. Notably, no differences were observed in the clinical self-report scales, indicating no differences in reported symptoms of ADHD or autism for spectators and non-spectators. Likewise, no relationship was seen between baseline concentrations of testosterone or cortisol and sports spectating in our sample. These results provide an assessment of the descriptive personality dimensions of frequent sports spectators and provide a basic taxonomy of how these traits are expressed across the population. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.paid.2011.10.048,Scopus,Personality and Individual Differences,"Gregory Appelbaum L., Cain M.S., Darling E.F., Stanton S.J., Nguyen M.T., Mitroff S.R.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia

,Why Health Care Needs Design Research: Broadening The Perspective On Communication In Pediatric Care Through Play,"Today’s pediatric health care lacks methods to tap into the emotional state of hospitalized pediatric patients (age 4-6 years). The most frequently used approaches were developed for adults and fail to acknowledge the importance of imaginary experiences and the notion of play that may appeal to children. The scope of this article is to introduce a new design-oriented method of gathering information about the emotional state of pediatric patients using an experimental computer game called the Child Patient game (CPgame). The CPgame was developed at a Danish hospital, and the results of the preliminary tests show that games could serve as a system in which children are willing to express their emotions through play. The results are based on two comparative analyses of the CPgame through which it is possible to identify three different types of players among the patients playing the game. Furthermore, the data reveal that pediatric patients display a radically different play pattern than children who are not in hospital. The inquiry takes an interdisciplinary approach; it has obvious health care-related objectives and seeks to meet the urgent need for new methods within health care to optimize communication with young children. At the same time, design research (i.e., the development of new knowledge through the development of a new design) heavily impacts the method. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",doi,10.1080/10410236.2014.917220,Scopus,Health Communication,"Knutz E., Ammentorp J., Kofoed P.-E.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Young Adults’ Media Use And Attitudes Toward Interpersonal And Institutional Forms Of Aggression.,"Links between media violence exposure and favorable attitudes toward interpersonal violence are well established, but few studies have examined whether associations extend to include favorable attitudes toward institutional forms of aggression. Studies on this topic have not assessed multiple forms of media use and statistically controlled for individual characteristics likely to influence attitudes beyond sociodemographic information. In this study, undergraduate students (N=319) aged 18–20 years (56% male) completed a survey assessing media use (number of hours per week spent playing videogames, watching movies/TV shows, watching TV sports) and attitudes toward interpersonal violence, punitive criminal justice policies, and different types of military activities (preparedness/defense and aggressive intervention). Greater number of hours spent watching TV contact sports was associated with more favorable attitudes toward military preparedness/defense, aggressive military intervention, and punitive criminal justice policies among men independently of parental education, lifetime violence exposure within the home and community, aggressive personality, and constrained problem solving style. Greater number of hours spent watching violent movies/TV was associated with more favorable attitudes toward military preparedness/defense among men and with more favorable attitudes toward interpersonal violence and punitive criminal justice policies among women, but these associations became non-significant when adjusting for covariates.

,"""Survivor"" Torches ""Who Wants To Be A Physician?"" In The Educational Games Ratings War","We recently developed an educational game for reviewing respiratory physiology in a large classroom. The ""Who Wants to be a Physician?"" game encouraged medical students to be active participants in the learning process. An evaluation of the game documented that students enjoyed the active format, and the students reported that the game enhanced their ability to understand and retain information. However, the evaluation also revealed that the game had limitations. Specifically, the students recommended the use of multiple-choice questions to match the Medical Board Examination format and to speed up the game (i.e., cover more topics). The students also wanted to increase their level of participation and interaction. Finally, we wanted to emphasize the benefits of peer instruction as a collaborative learning tool. To address these limitations, we designed a new game, ""Survivor."" Survivor incorporated multiple-choice questions and emphasized peer instruction and a capacity to gather information and solve novel problems. In addition, participation was increased by including the student audience in the game. Finally, an evaluation instrument was utilized to assess the effectiveness of this instructional tool in an academic setting. As a result of these improvements, the evaluation documents that the newly developed tool is a more effective educational game that couples fun and creative excitement with proven and effective educational concepts.",pmid,11850325,Scopus,American Journal of Physiology - Advances in Physiology Education,"Howard M.G., Collins H.L., DiCarlo S.E.",2002,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,[Association Between Level Of Intelligence And Heart Rate Variability].,Earlier we discovered that heart rate variability was associated with the level of intelligence. The purpose of this study is to confirm this association using more reliable method and to define more precisely the frequency band within which the amplitude of the heart rate modulations is related to intelligence. 13 males (aged 14 to 17) were the study subjects. The total score of the computer game Tetris was taken as a general measure of the intelligence level. Heart rate was recorded electrocardiographically both at rest and during playing Tetris. Frequency analysis of heart rate was carried out with digital Fourier transformation. Correlation analysis showed that there was positive association between the level of intelligence and the amplitude of heart rate modulation at the frequencies 0.30 and 0.15 modulations per RR interval. This association is closer for the heart rate at rest than for the heart rate during mental work and for the frequency 0.30 than for the 0.15 modulations per RR interval.,pmid,21961308,pubmed,Rossiiskii fiziologicheskii zhurnal imeni I.M.

,3D Cpr Game Can Improve Cpr Skill Retention.,"Adequate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) skill is essential in improving survival rate of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). However, the skill deteriorates rapidly following CPR training. We developed a computer game by using 3-Dimensional virtual technology (3-D CPR game) for laypersons in the purpose to improve skill retention. As the testing phase, a randomized control trial, in which we recruited 97 freshman medical students who had no prior CPR training experience, was used to test its effect on 3-month CPR Skill retention. The usability of the game was also tested using a 33 item questionnaire rated with 5-point Likert scale. Three months after the initial CPR training, the retention rate of CPR skill in the game group was significantly higher compared with the control (p&amp;lt;0.05) and the average score on 4 dimensions of usability were 3.99-4.05. Overall, using 3-D CPR game in improving CPR skill retention is feasible and effective.",pmid,26262276,pubmed,Studies in health technology and informatics,"Li, Jia; Xu, Yimin; Xu, Yahong; Yue, Peng; Sun, Liu; Guo, Ming; Xiao, Shuqin; Ding, Shu; Cui, Yanyan; Li, Shulan; Yang, Qiuying; Chang, Polun; Wu, Ying",2016,NA,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,A Preliminary Exploration Of The Effects Of A 6-Week Interactive Video Dance Exercise Program In An Adult Population.,"The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of a 6-week interactive video dance game (IVDG) program on adult participants' cardiorespiratory status and body mass index (BMI). Twenty-seven healthy adult participants attended IVDG sessions over a 6-week period. Participants completed pre- and post-testing consisting of a submaximal VO(2) treadmill test, assessment of resting heart rate (RHR) and blood pressure (BP), BMI, and general health questionnaires. Data were analyzed using descriptives, paired t-tests to assess pre-to post-testing differences, and one-way ANOVAs to analyze variables among select groups of participants. Questionnaire data was manually coded and assessed. Twenty participants attended at least 75% of available sessions and were used in data analysis. Mean BMI decreased significantly (from 26.96 kg/m(2) to 26.21 kg/m(2); 2.87%) and cardiorespiratory fitness measured by peak VO(2) increased significantly (from 20.63 ml/kg/min to 21.69 ml/kg/min; 5.14%). Most participants reported that the IVDG program was a good workout, and that they were encouraged to continue or start an exercise routine. Forty percent reported improvements in sleep, and nearly half stated they had or were considering purchasing a home version of a video dance game. Interactive video dance game is an effective and enjoyable exercise program for adults who wish to decrease their BMI and improve components of cardiorespiratory fitness.",pmid,22163175,pubmed,Cardiopulmonary physical therapy journal,"Mejia-Downs, Anne; Fruth, Stacie J; Clifford, Anne; Hine, Stephanie; Huckstep, Jeremy; Merkel, Heidi; Wilkinson, Hilary; Yoder, Jason",2012,NA,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,A Randomized Field Trial Of Acindes: A Child-Centered Training Model For Children With Chronic Illnesses (Asthma And Epilepsy),"A randomized field trial of a child-centered model of training for self- management of chronic illnesses was conducted of 355 Spanish-speaking school-aged children, between 6 and 15 years old, with moderate to severe asthma and epilepsy, in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The model, based on play techniques, consists of five weekly meetings of 8-10 families, with children's and parents' groups held simultaneously, coordinated by specially trained teachers and outside the hospital environment. Children are trained to assume a leading role in the management of their health; parents learn to be facilitators; and physicians provide guidance, acting as counselors. Group activities include games, drawings, stories, videos, and role-playing. Children and parents were interviewed at home before the program and 6 and 12 months after the program, and medical and school records were monitored for emergency and routine visits, hospitalizations, and school absenteeism. In asthma and epilepsy, children in the experiment showed significant improvements in knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors compared to controls (probability of experimental gain over controls = .69 for epilepsy and .56 for asthma, with σ2 = .007 and .016, respectively). Parent participants in the experiment had improved knowledge of asthma (39% before vs. 58% after) and epilepsy (22% before vs. 56% after), with a probability of gain = .62 (σ2 = .0026) with respect to the control group. Similar positive outcomes were found in fears of child death (experimental 39% before vs. 4% after for asthma, 69% before vs. 30% after for epilepsy), as well as in disruption of family life and patient-physician relationship, while controls showed no change. Regarding clinical variables, for both asthma and epilepsy, children in the experimental group had significantly fewer crises than the controls after the groups (P = .036 and P = .026). Visits to physicians showed a significant decrease for those with asthma (P = .048), and emergency visits decreased for those with epilepsy (P = .046). An 18-item Children Health Locus of Control Scale (CHLCS) showed a significant increase in internality in experimental group children with asthma and epilepsy (P &lt; .01), while controls did not change or performed worse 12 months after the program. School absenteeism was reduced significantly for those with asthma and epilepsy (for the group with asthma, fall/winter P = .006, and spring P = .029; for the group with epilepsy, P = .011). Conclusion. The program was successful in improving the health, activity, and quality of life of children with asthma and epilepsy. The data suggested that an autonomous (Piagetian) model of training is a key to this success, reinforcing children's autonomous decision making.",pmid,10856009,Scopus,Journal of Urban Health,"Tieffenberg J.A., Wood E.I., Alonso A., Tossutti M.S., Vicente M.F.",2e3,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,A Randomized Prospective Study Of The Use Of Ipads In Reducing Anxiety During Cast Room Procedures.,"Cast room procedures can be a source of anxiety for children. Various techniques, including music therapy, have been evaluated as a way to ease this anxiety. The use of iPads as a form of distraction during cast room procedures has not previously been evaluated and was the purpose of the current study. 146 children and adolescents who underwent cast room procedures during June- August 2015 were randomly assigned to one of three groups: no-iPad, iPad with video, or iPad with game. Patient heart rates were measured using a pulse oximeter in the waiting room, before the procedure, during the procedure, and after the procedure. Mean values for each group were calculated at each time interval and compared both between groups and within groups over time. There were no significant differences in baseline (waiting room) heart rate between the no-iPad and iPad groups. When compared with the no-iPad group, there was a trend toward decreased heart rate in the video group (p=0.13) and a significant increase in heart rate in the game group (p=0.026) before the procedure. There were no significant decreases in heart rate within any of the groups when comparing the waiting room heart rates with the during procedure heart rates. There was a significant difference between the no-iPad and video groups (p=0.047) when comparing the change in heart rate from baseline to before the procedure, with a decreased heart rate observed in the video group. The results of this study show a significant decrease in heart rate when transitioning from the waiting room to the cast room while watching videos on the iPad. iPad-based video delivery appears to decrease anxiety prior to cast room procedures. iPad-based game play is difficult to assess as elevations in heart rate prior to the procedure are presumed to be related to game play and confound the observed effect it may have on anxiety related to the procedure.",pmid,27528849,pubmed,The Iowa orthopaedic journal,"Ko, Justine S; Whiting, Zachariah; Nguyen, Cynthia; Liu, Raymond W; Gilmore, Allison",2017,NA,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Active Video/Arcade Games (Exergaming) And Energy Expenditure In College Students.,"Video games have become increasingly popular among young adults. The purpose of this pilot study was to determine if interactive video/arcade games, requiring physical activity to play, increase the energy expenditure (EE) and heart rate (HR) of young adults enough to elicit a training response. Thirteen male and female participants 26.6 ± 5.7 years of age were in the study. Participants were familiarized with equipment and allowed to practice with three games: (1) moving and striking lighted pads, (2) riding a bike to increase the pace of a race car, and (3) boxing against a video simulated opponent. A portable metabolic cart and HR monitor were attached to participants to measure baseline and exercise values. Participants could play any of the three games for 30 minutes while metabolic and HR data were collected. Exercise data were compared to baseline measures, and the 3 games were compared for EE. Paired sample t-tests showed baseline and exercise values differed for HR (t(12) = -18.91, p < 0.01), and EE (t(12) = -15.62, p < 0.01). The boxing game provided the highest VO2 (17.47 ± 4.79 ml·kg(·-1)min(-1)). Participants achieved 60% or better of their HR reserve (162.82 ± 10.78 beats·min(-1),) well within the ACSM guidelines for a training HR. Caloric expenditure during the 30-minute exercise session (226. 07 ± 48.68) is also within the ACSM recommendations for daily physical activity. Thus, interactive video/arcade games that require physical activity to play can be utilized as part of an overall aerobic exercise program.",pmid,20407622,pubmed,International journal of exercise science,"Siegel, Shannon R; L Haddock, Bryan; Dubois, Andrea M; Wilkin, Linda D",2017,NA,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Competitive Active Video Games: Physiological And Psychological Responses In Children And Adolescents.,"Recent strategies to reduce sedentary behaviour in children include replacing sedentary screen time for active video games. Active video game studies have focused principally on the metabolic consumption of a single player, with physiological and psychological responses of opponent-based multiplayer games to be further evaluated. To determine whether adding a competitive component to playing active video games impacts physiological and psychological responses in players. Sixty-two healthy Caucasian children and adolescents, nine to 14 years years of age, completed three conditions (8 min each) in random order: treadmill walking, and single and opponent-based Kinect active video games. Affect, arousal, rate of perceived exertion, heart rate and percentage of heart rate reserve were measured for each participant and condition. Kinect conditions revealed significantly higher heart rate, percentage of heart rate reserve, rate of perceived exertion and arousal when compared with treadmill walking (P<0.001). Opponent-based condition revealed lower values for the rate of perceived exertion (P=0.02) and higher affect (P=0.022) when compared with single play. Competitive active video games improved children's psychological responses (affect and rate of perceived exertion) compared with single play, providing a solution that may contribute toward improved adherence to physical activity. Parmi les récentes stratégies en vue de réduire les comportements sédentaires chez les enfants, soulignons le remplacement du temps d’écran sédentaire par des jeux vidéo actifs. Les études sur ce type de jeux ont surtout porté sur la consommation métabolique en mode solo. Les réponses physiologiques et psychologiques de jeux en mode multijoueur comportant des adversaires n’ont pas encore été évaluées. Déterminer si l’ajout d’un élément compétitif aux jeux vidéo actifs influe sur les réponses physiologiques et psychologiques chez les joueurs. Soixante-deux enfants et adolescents blancs en bonne santé de neuf à 14 ans ont effectué trois conditionnements de huit minutes chacun, dans un ordre aléatoire : marche sur tapis roulant et jeux vidéo actifs Kinect en mode solo et multijoueur (Microsoft Corporation, États-Unis). Les chercheurs ont mesuré l’affect, l’éveil, le taux d’effort perçu, la fréquence cardiaque et le pourcentage de réserve de fréquence cardiaque de chaque participant et de chaque conditionnement. Le conditionnement Kinect a suscité une augmentation significative de la fréquence cardiaque, du pourcentage de réserve de fréquence cardiaque, d’effort perçu et d’éveil par rapport à la marche sur tapis roulant (P<0,001). Le conditionnement contre un adversaire révélait des valeurs plus faibles de taux d’effort perçu (P=0,02) et un affect plus élevé (P=0,022) que le jeu en mode solo. Les jeux vidéo actifs compétitifs donnent de meilleures réponses psychologiques chez les enfants (affect et taux d’efforts perçu) que le jeu en mode solo.

,Computerised Biofeedback Games: A New Method For Teaching Stress Management And Its Use In Irritable Bowel Syndrome,"Objectives: To develop and test a computer biofeedback game designed to teach deep relaxation to patients with a stress related disorder and to assess whether relaxation can improve symptomatic episodes. ■ Study design and setting: An open, prospective, single centre study. Department of Gastroenterology, Royal Free Hospital, London. ■ Subjects: Forty patients with irritable bowel syndrome refractory to conventional medical treatment. ■ Main outcome measures: Development of a computer aided biofeedback apparatus directed at the gut for teaching relaxation to patients with irritable bowel syndrome. The patients' ability to complete a computer game involving biofeedback modulated by a physiological loop that related changes in stress (monitored by electrodermal activity) to animated computer graphics. The degree to which deep relaxation was achieved was measured numerically by a progressive reduction in the sensitivity level of the biofeedback loop. The success of relaxation in ameliorating physical symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome was assessed by daily diaries in which global and weighted bowel symptom scores were entered. ■ Results: A computer biofeedback game based on animated gut imagery was successfully developed. Most patients learned to achieve progressively deeper levels of relaxation after four 30 minute biofeedback sessions (mean difference in sensitivity level 2.0 (95% confidence interval 0.96 to 2.93), p<0.001). Use of 'dosed' relaxation when bowel symptoms were troublesome was helpful in 50% of patients. It reduced the global symptom score (mean difference 0.5 (0.02 to 0.32), p<0.04) and the bowel symptom score (mean difference 0.8 (0.04 to 1.58), p<0.04). At long term follow up, 64% of patients who had been helped by dosed relaxation continued to use the technique, although they had had no further contact with the hospital. ■ Conclusions: This computer biofeedback game taught deep relaxation rapidly and effectively. Half the patients with refractory irritable bowel syndrome found the technique helpful on most occasions on which it was used. Computer biofeedback games may offer a simple, inexpensive strategy for managing other stress related medical disorders.",pmid,9881312,Scopus,Journal of the Royal College of Physicians of London,"Leahy A., Clayman C., Mason I., Lloyd G., Epstein O.",1998,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Decreased Ventral Anterior Cingulate Cortex Activity Is Associated With Reduced Social Pain During Emotional Support.,"People feel psychological pain when they are excluded, and this pain is often attenuated when emotional support is received. It is therefore likely that a specific neural mechanism underlies the detection of social exclusion. Similarly, specific neural mechanisms may underlie the beneficial effects of emotional support. Although neuroimaging researchers have recently examined the neural basis of social pain, there is presently no agreement as to which part of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is involved in the perception and modulation of social pain. We hypothesized that activity in those brain regions that are associated with social pain would be correlated with decrements in social pain induced by emotional support. To examine the effects of emotional support on social pain caused by exclusion, we conducted an fMRI study in which participants played a virtual ball-tossing game. Participants were initially included and later excluded from the game. In the latter half of the session from which participants were excluded, participants received emotionally supportive text messages. We found that emotional support led to increased activity in the left lateral/medial prefrontal cortices and some temporal regions. Those individuals who experienced greater attenuation of social pain exhibited lower ventral ACC and higher left lateral prefrontal cortex activation. These results suggest that the ventral ACC underlies social pain, and that emotional support enhances prefrontal cortex activity, which in turn may lead to a weakened affective response.",pmid,19562631,Scopus,Social neuroscience,"Onoda K., Okamoto Y., Nakashima K., Nittono H., Ura M., Yamawaki S.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Do Exergames Allow Children To Achieve Physical Activity Intensity Commensurate With National Guidelines?,"The purpose of this study was to determine if two popular exergames, Wii Fit™ and EA Sports Active™, both games for the Nintendo Wii™ console, help children achieve intensity consistent with recommended physical activity guidelines. Thirty children (19 males and 11 females, Mean age = 9.4 ± 1.8 years) participated in this study by playing each game during one research session. During the session participants wore a heart rate monitor and accelerometer to measure exercise intensity. Perceived exertion (RPE) was measured with the children's run/walk OMNI scale. All three measures of exercise intensity (heart rate, accelerometer counts, and RPE) found that the EA Sports Active™ game session elicited higher exercise intensity. However, heart rate data found both games to achieve moderate intensity (65-68% age-predicted HRmax). When using heart rate as an indicator of exercise intensity it appears that both exergames were of sufficient intensity to achieve physical activity guidelines. Future studies should continue to investigate the utility of exergaming in helping children to become more physically active.",pmid,27182367,pubmed,International journal of exercise science,"Perron, Rachel M; Graham, Courtney A; Feldman, Jamie R; Moffett, Rebecca A; Hall, Eric E",2017,NA,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Educational Intervention By Computer In Childhood Asthma: A Randomized Clinical Trial Testing The Use Of A New Teaching Intervention In Childhood Asthma,"To affect asthma-related knowledge, behavior, and morbidity, researchers tested a new educational intervention for children with asthma: an asthma-specific computer game called Asthma Command, which was specifically designed for this study. Sixty-five children with moderately severe asthma were randomly assigned to one of two groups, and 54 completed the study. Both groups were seen approximately six times during the 1 year of the study. Control subjects (n = 29) played routine computer games. Experimental subjects (n = 25) played Asthma Command. Compared with children in the control group, experimental subjects showed improvement in knowledge about asthma (P < .001), behavior related to the management of asthma (P < .008), and a trend toward the reduction of acute visits due to asthma (P < .13). Children in the experimental group also scored higher on the assessment of behaviors related to the management of asthma that were specifically addressed by the intervention provided by Asthma Command (P < .01). Differences between the control and experimental groups showed a greater improvement in the experimental group in 21 (84%) of the 25 outcome variables in the study (P = .004, Sign test). The study indicates that an asthma-specific computer game can significantly affect knowledge and behavior and may potentially affect morbidity in childhood asthma.",pmid,3510016,Scopus,Pediatrics,"Rubin D.H., Leventhal J.M., Sadock R.T., Letovsky E., Schottland P., Clemente I., McCarthy P.",1986,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia

,Physical Load Imposed On Soccer Players During Small-Sided Training Games,"Aim. The aim of this study was to examine the kinematical, physiological and technical load imposed on soccer players during three typical small-sided 3-a-side training games carried out in an artificial grass 33×20 m surface. Methods. Kinematic analysis was carried out with a bidimen-sional photogrammetric video system. Heart rate was recorded at 5 s intervals using Polar Accurex Plus heart rate monitors and expressed in relation to individual maximal heart rate (HRmax). Technical parameters were registered using a specifically designed notation sheet. Results. The overall intensity of these three small-sided games was superior than the experienced during competitive matches. Distance covered (747-749 vs 638 m) and mean heart rate (173 vs 166 b·min-1) were higher (P&lt;0.05) in the drills without goalkeepers. The inclusion of goalkeepers reduced the tempo of the game as players performed less (P&lt;0.05) high-intensity running and increased (P&lt;0.05) low-intensity activities. Time spent exercising at intensities between 76-85 % HRmax was lower (P&lt;0.05) in the game without goals, whereas the presence of goalkeepers reduced (P&lt;0.05) activities performed exceeding 86% HRmax. Conclusion. The results of this study suggest that small-sided games can be used effectively to develop the specific endurance capacity of football players. The integration of these drills by coaches during the regular training schedule can help replicating the demands experienced during real match-play.",pmid,18427410,Scopus,Journal of Sports Medicine and Physical Fitness,"Mallo J., Navarro E.",2008,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Psychophysiological Interrelations And Reactivity Characteristics In Hypertensives.,"Two hundred three patients with essential hypertension (20- to 55-year-old men) were examined initially and at the end of a 1-year follow-up. Clinical, psychological, and psychophysiological methods were used. In the psychophysiological assessment, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), heart rate, and respiratory rate were recorded at rest and during various emotional stressors. Patients who exhibited a greater increase in blood pressure during psychological stress, in addition to an inherited predisposition to essential hypertension, had higher levels of assertiveness and interpersonal conflict. The differences in cardiovascular response to various emotional stressors depended on the psychological features of the hypertensive patients. An SBP increase during the performance of mental arithmetic correlated with anxiety level, whereas a DBP increase was associated with assertiveness. Changes in SBP and DBP during a stressful computer game correlated with the level of competitiveness and conflict. Hypertensive patients who exhibited an increase in blood pressure during the follow-up were characterized initially by a greater DBP increase during emotional stress and a longer recovery period.",pmid,3243219,Scopus,Health Psychology,"Aivazyan T.A., Zaitsev V.P., Khramelashvili V.V., Golanov E.V., Kichkin V.I.",1988,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Race And Cardiovascular Reactivity: A Neglected Relationship,"The magnitude of the cardiovascular response to stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. Psychological stress procedures have received increased usage as an alternative to expensive physical (exercise) stress procedures. In the present investigation, 213 healthy, black or white, male or female children between the ages of 6 and 18 years were exposed to the psychological stress of a video game. The video game challenge was administered by a black or a white experimenter and was played under three levels of increasing stress, 1) personal challenge, 2) experimenter's challenge, and 3) experimenter’s challenge accompanied by a financial incentive, while blood pressure and heart rate were monitored. Results indicated that the video games provoked significant and incremental cardiovascular reactivity across the games. Black children demonstrated significantly greater reactivity than white children; the racial difference was more reliably observed for systolic and diastolic blood pressure than for heart rate. Furthermore, the race of the experimenter exerted a significant effect and often interacted with the race of the child, such that greater reactivity occurred in same-race pairings than in mixed-race pairings. These results suggest that reactivity is affected by an individual's race and social milieu and that reactivity may be one mechanism responsible for the greater prevalence of hypertension among blacks. © 1986 American Heart Association, Inc.",pmid,3770868,Scopus,Hypertension,"Murphy J.K., Alpert B.S., Moes D.M., Somes G.W.",1986,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Racial Differences In Endothelin-1 At Rest And In Response To Acute Stress In Adolescent Males,"Blacks exhibit greater vasoconstriction-mediated blood pressure (BP) increases in response to stress than do whites. Endothelin-1 (ET-1), a potent vasoconstrictive peptide, has been proposed as having a role in racial differences in stress reactivity. We evaluated the hemodynamic and plasma ET- 1 levels of 41 (23 whites, 18 blacks, mean age 18.6 years) normotensive adolescent males at rest and in response to a video game challenge and forehead cold stimulation. Measurements were performed at catheter insertion and before and immediately after the 2 stressors, which were separated by 20- minute rest periods. Blacks exhibited higher absolute levels of diastolic blood pressure, total peripheral resistance index, or both in response to catheter insertion and to the video game challenge and during recovery from video game challenge and cold stimulation (P<0.05 for all). Blacks exhibited higher absolute levels of ET-1 at every evaluation point (P<0.05 for all) and greater increases in ET-1 in response to both stressors (ps<0.05). These findings suggest that altered endothelial function may be involved in racial differences in hemodynamic reactivity to stress and possibly in the development of essential hypertension.",pmid,10720585,Scopus,Hypertension,"Treiber F.A., Jackson R.W., Davis H., Pollock J.S., Kapuku G., Mensah G.A., Pollock D.M.",2e3,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Social Support As A Moderator Of Cardiovascular Reactivity In Women: A Test Of The Direct Effects And Buffering Hypotheses,"This study examines the possibility that social support operates as a moderator of cardiovascular reactivity in women.Two models by which social support may operate were examined: The direct effects and buffering models. Twenty-six subjects were exposed to four conditions while playing a video game: two levels of stress (low, high) and two levels of social support (alone, together). Blood pressure and heart rate were monitored continuously. Ratings of stress were obtained for each condition. Results indicated that the support manipulation produced significant main effects for diastolic blood pressure and stress ratings, with lower diastolic blood pressure and ratings observed in the ""together"" condition, and that the interaction between support and stress produced lower reactivity for the cardiovascular measures in the high stress (but not the low stress) condition. No interaction was found for the stress ratings. We conclude that the results provide support for both the buffering and direct effects models. Implications concerning the (within-subjects) design of the study and the stress ratings are discussed. © 1995 by American Psychosomatic Society.",pmid,7732154,Scopus,Psychosomatic Medicine,"Gerin W., Milner D., Chawla S., Pickering T.G.",1995,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,The Association Of Race And Sex To The Pressure Natriuresis Response To Stress,"Objective: Sympathetic nervous system activation promoting sodium retention has long been recognized to play a significant role in the development and maintenance of salt-sensitive hypertension. The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of race and sex on the pressure natriuresis response to prolonged behavioral stress in youth. Methods: The 190 subjects included 94 boys (41 African American, 53 Caucasian) and 96 girls (44 African American, 52 Caucasian) of similar age (17-19 years). The stress test was composed of a one hour competitive video game task preceded and followed by two-hour rest periods. Blood pressure (BP) was obtained at 15 minute intervals and sodium excretion (UNaV) was measured hourly. The general linear model was used to model the effects of race, sex, and their interaction on the variables of interest. Results: Caucasians, compared to African Americans, had a greater change in UNaV (F[1,183]=5.28, P=.0227), as did boys compared to girls (F[1,183]=5.72, P=.0178), with no interaction between race and sex. The race-by-sex interaction was significant for the change in systolic BP (F[1,183]=5.66, P=.0184), with Caucasian girls showing a smaller change than the other three race/sex groups. Conclusion: African Americans have a reduced natriuretic response to stress, which may be a marker or mechanism for the development of salt-sensitive hypertension in this population.

Male regional-level table tennis players were asked to empathize with players in a very important contest by watching two video scenarios of a table tennis game in two separate sessions. The videos presented two inverted scenarios in which score gaps gradually increased or decreased. Competitive anxiety, selfconfidence (Study 1), and goal involvement states (Study 2) were measured before each point. Cognitive and somatic anxieties decreased linearly during the increasing scenario, but increased nonlinearly in the decreasing scenario. Mastery-avoidance goals decreased nonlinearly in the increasing scenario, increased nonlinearly in the decreasing scenario, and displayed a negative hysteresis pattern. These findings offer new insights into the dynamics of psychological momentum and suggest new avenues of research. © 2010 Human Kinetics, Inc.",pmid,20587824,Scopus,Journal of Sport and Exercise Psychology,"Gernigon C., Briki W., Eykens K.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,"The Effects Of Fifa 2015 Computer Games On Changes In Cognitive, Hormonal And Brain Waves Functions Of Young Men Volunteers.","Computer games have attracted remarkable attentions in general publics with different cultures and their effects are subject of research by cognitive neuroscientists. In the present study, possible effects of the game Fifa 2015 on cognitive performance, hormonal levels, and electroencephalographic (EEG) signals were evaluated in young male volunteers. Thirty two subjects aged 20 years on average participated mutually in playing computer game Fifa 2015. Identification information and general knowledge about the game were collected. Saliva samples from the contestants were obtained before and after the competition. Perceptive and cognitive performance including the general cognitive health, response delay, attention maintenance, and mental fatigue were measured using PASAT test. EEG were recorded during the play using EEG device and analyzed later using QEEG. Simultaneously, the players' behavior were recorded using a video camera. Saliva cortisol levels were assessed by ELISA kit. Data were analyzed by SPSS program. The impact of playing computer games on cortisol concentration of saliva before and after the game showed that the amount of saliva plasma after playing the game has dropped significantly. Also the impact of playing computer games on mental health, before and after the game indicated that the number of correct answers has not changed significantly. This indicates that sustained attention has increased in participants after the game in comparison with before that. Also it is shown that mental fatigue measured by PASAT test, did not changed significantly after the game in comparison to before that. The impact of game on changes in brain waves showed that the subjects in high activity state during playing the game had higher power of the EEG signals in most of the channels in lower frequency bands in compared to normal state. The present study showed that computer games can positively affect the stress system and the perceptual-cognitive system. Even though this impact was not significant in most cases, the changes in cognitive and hormonal test and also in brain waves were visible. Hence, due to the importance of this matter, it is necessary to create control systems in selecting the types of games for playing.",pmid,26904177,pubmed,Basic and clinical neuroscience,"Aliyari, Hamed; Kazemi, Masoomeh; Tekieh, Elaheh; Salehi, Maryam; Sahraei, Hedayat; Daliri, Mohammad Reza; Agaei, Hassan; Minaei-Bidgoli, Behrouz; Lashgari, Reza; Srahian, Nahid; Hadipour, Mohammad Mehdi; Salehi, Mostafa; Ranjbar Aghdam, Asghar",2016,NA,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,User Stress Detection In Human-Computer Interactions.,"The emerging research area of Affective Computing seeks to advance the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) by enabling computers to interact with users in ways appropriate to their affective states. Affect recognition, including the use of psychophysiologcal measures (e.g. heart rate), facial expressions, speech recognition etc. to derive an assessment of user affective state based on factors from the current task context, is an important foundation required for the development of Affective Computing. Our research focuses on the use of three physiological signals: Blood Volume Pulse (BVP), Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) and Pupil Diameter (PD), to automatically monitor the level of stress in computer users. This paper reports on the hardware and software instrumentation development and signal processing approach used to detect the stress level of a subject interacting with a computer, within the framework of a specific experimental task, which is called the 'Stroop Test'. For this experiment, a computer game was implemented and adapted to make the subject experience the Stroop Effect, evoked by the mismatch between the font color and the meaning of a certain word (name of a color) displayed, while his/her BVP, GSR and PD signals were continuously recorded. Several data processing techniques were applied to extract effective attributes of the stress level of the subjects throughout the experiment. Current results indicate that there exists interesting similarity among changes in those three signals and the shift in the emotional states when stress stimuli are applied to the interaction environment.",pmid,15850118,pubmed,Biomedical sciences instrumentation,"Zhai, Jing; Barreto, Armando B; Chin, Craig; Li, Chao",2005,NA,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,"Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance - United States, 2015","Problem: Priority health-risk behaviors contribute to the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among youth and adults. Population-based data on these behaviors at the national, state, and local levels can help monitor the effectiveness of public health interventions designed to protect and promote the health of youth nationwide. Reporting Period Covered: September 2014-December 2015. Description of the System: The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) monitors six categories of priority health behaviors among youth and young adults: 1) behaviors that contribute to unintentional injuries and violence; 2) tobacco use; 3) alcohol and other drug use; 4) sexual behaviors related to unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; 5) unhealthy dietary behaviors; and 6) physical inactivity. In addition, YRBSS monitors the prevalence of obesity and asthma and other priority health behaviors. YRBSS includes a national school-based Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) conducted by CDC and state and large urban school district school-based YRBSs conducted by state and local education and health agencies. This report summarizes results for 118 health behaviors plus obesity, overweight, and asthma from the 2015 national survey, 37 state surveys, and 19 large urban school district surveys conducted among students in grades 9-12. Results: Results from the 2015 national YRBS indicated that many high school students are engaged in priority health-risk behaviors associated with the leading causes of death among persons aged 10-24 years in the United States. During the 30 days before the survey, 41.5% of high school students nationwide among the 61.3% who drove a car or other vehicle during the 30 days before the survey had texted or e-mailed while driving, 32.8% had drunk alcohol, and 21.7% had used marijuana. During the 12 months before the survey, 15.5% had been electronically bullied, 20.2% had been bullied on school property, and 8.6% had attempted suicide. Many high school students are engaged in sexual risk behaviors related to unintended pregnancies and STIs, including HIV infection. Nationwide, 41.2% of students had ever had sexual intercourse, 30.1% had had sexual intercourse during the 3 months before the survey (i.e., currently sexually active), and 11.5% had had sexual intercourse with four or more persons during their life. Among currently sexually active students, 56.9% had used a condom during their last sexual intercourse. Results from the 2015 national YRBS also indicated many high school students are engaged in behaviors associated with chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes. During the 30 days before the survey, 10.8% of high school students had smoked cigarettes and 7.3% had used smokeless tobacco. During the 7 days before the survey, 5.2% of high school students had not eaten fruit or drunk 100% fruit juices and 6.7% had not eaten vegetables. More than one third (41.7%) had played video or computer games or used a computer for something that was not school work for 3 or more hours per day on an average school day and 14.3% had not participated in at least 60 minutes of any kind of physical activity that increased their heart rate and made them breathe hard on at least 1 day during the 7 days before the survey. Further, 13.9% had obesity and 16.0% were overweight. Interpretation: Many high school students engage in behaviors that place them at risk for the leading causes of morbidity and mortality. The prevalence of most health behaviors varies by sex, race/ethnicity, and grade and across states and large urban school districts. Long-term temporal changes also have occurred. Since the earliest year of data collection, the prevalence of most healthrisk behaviors has decreased (e.g., riding with a driver who had been drinking alcohol, physical fighting, current cigarette use, current alcohol use, and current sexual activity), but the prevalence of other behaviors and health outcomes has not changed (e.g., uicide attempts treated by a doctor or nurse, smokeless tobacco use, having ever used marijuana, and attending physical education classes) or has increased (e.g., having not gone to school because of safety concerns, obesity, overweight, not eating vegetables, and not drinking milk). Monitoring emerging risk behaviors (e.g., texting and driving, bullying, and electronic vapor product use) is important to understand how they might vary over time. Public Health Action: YRBSS data are used widely to compare the prevalence of health behaviors among subpopulations of students; assess trends in health behaviors over time; monitor progress toward achieving 21 national health objectives for Healthy People 2020 and one of the 26 leading health indicators; provide comparable state and large urban school district data; and help develop and evaluate school and community policies, programs, and practices designed to decrease health-risk behaviors and improve health outcomes among youth.",pmid,27280474,Scopus,MMWR Surveillance Summaries,"Kann L., McManus T., Harris W.A., Shanklin S.L., Flint K.H., Hawkins J., Queen B., Lowry R., Olsen E.O., Chyen D., Whittle L., Thornton J., Lim C., Yamakawa Y., Brener N., Zaza S.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,A Method To Evaluate Emotions In Educational Video Games For Children,"Although several evaluation analyses have recently been proposed to assess the user or player experience of playing a video game, we found the need for these to be adapted when we wanted to apply them to young children. However, young children are unable to spend a long time grading many attributes or indexes after playing. Thus, selecting the most important aspects to be analyzed is required in order to perform a non-time consuming and significant evaluation method to be used with children. Hence, this work is focused on designing an evaluation method to assess emotions when young children (3-5 years old) play a video game. In particular, we are interested in educational video games because of the importance that emotion has in motivation, which in turn is highly important in education. Although the method presented follows the pre-test, test and post-test classic structure, the activities carried out in each of these phases have been modified to, firstly, include no elements which require reading-writing skills, which are as yet undeveloped at this age and, secondly, to limit the emotional impact that children can suffer when they are aware that they are being evaluated. We have applied the proposed method in a sample of 39 children playing the educational video game ""Ato's Adventure"", which was in its final development phases, obtaining very promising results both for the analysis method and for the video game. © J.UCS.",eid,2-s2.0-84882967322,Scopus,Journal of Universal Computer Science,"Padilla-Zea N., López-Arcos J.R., González Sánchez J.L., Gutiérrez Vela F.L., Abad-Arranz A.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Adaptive Strategies: A Novel Game-Theoretic Analysis For Autonomous Distributed Systems In Dynamic Environments,"We propose a new concept of an adaptive strategy, and we consider its robustness against other strategies. On average, the adaptive strategy achieves a higher payoff than other strategies. The strength of a strategy is defined as an adaptive measure calculated on the basis of a payoff obtained through interactions among agents. An agent interacts with other agents by selecting various strategies in computer networks. For the adaptive strategy, we give a formal definition of the adaptive measure of how well it behaves against other strategies. In order to demonstrate a performance of the adaptive strategy, we present a calculation example of the adaptive measure for the iterated prisoner's dilemma with three simple strategies. In the examplee, Trigger strategy is found to be the best strategy when we evaluate it by the adaptive measure, even if All-D (always defect) strategy achieves the highest expected payoff. Furthermore, we investigate the adaptive strategies for a self-repairing network consisting of agents with spatial strategies. According to simulations, under some conditions, the strategies obtaining the highest adaptive measures do not correspond to those with the highest averaged resources. The significance of the adaptive strategies is considered with a statistical analysis. The adaptive measure enables us to evaluate the behaviors of the adaptive strategies against those of other strategies. In addition, we discuss some open problems for polishing a notion of the adaptive strategies. © 2014.",eid,2-s2.0-84898626702,Scopus,"International Journal of Innovative Computing, Information and Control","Tokümitsu M., Ishida A.Y.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,All Just Fun And Games? Men And Media Violence,"Decades of research have documented associations between violent video game use and a host of negative outcomes including aggression, desensitization to violence, decreased empathy and prosocial behavior, and increased hostile attribution bias. Boys' and men's involvement in violent video gaming is pronounced and increasing. These factors, as well as the changing content of video games, present cause for concern regarding the potentially widespread impact of violent video games. The present chapter summarizes the hormonal and neurobiological aspects of aggression in males as well as the impact of violent video game use on these factors. Negative outcomes, including relational problems, impact on the children of gamers, and internet gaming disorder are considered, as are prevention and intervention efforts addressing these issues. © 2015 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

,Behavioral Presence Test In Threatening Virtual Environments,"Presence, the impression of being existent in artificially created places, is an important factor for achieving maximum experience in virtual environments (VEs) and hence in their use for experiments or therapy. To date, most clinical studies have used selfreport questionnaires or physiological measures to appraise the degree of presence. Some studies that have tested behavioral scales have used a single VE, required additional equipment, or did not test psychometric properties during immersion in the VR. The current study described and tested an operationalized, easy-to-use scale of presence, the Behavior Presence Test in Threatening VEs (BPTT), through the observation of overt behavior exhibited by a sample of 40 participants during immersion in five different threatening virtual situations. The BPTT was compared with standard subjective and physiological measures of presence and anxiety. The VEs resulted in clear increases in anxiety and arousal. Most importantly, findings demonstrated the consistency, reliability and validity of the BPTT. Video game experience did not seem to have any impact on presence or on participants' behavior. The test is a step forward in creating an objective assessment of presence during the virtual reality experience and without the need for additional equipment. Future work should focus on developing broader tests suitable for use in any threatening or nonthreatening VEs. ©2012 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",eid,2-s2.0-84866547801,Scopus,Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments,"Malbos E., Rapee R.M., Kavakli M.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,"Citizenship, Freedom, And The Family: Public Access Through Private Modalities","During the spring of 2005, early childhood education specialist Mindy Holohan was traveling with her family of four on a road trip to visit her children's grandparents in Chicago. Midway through the trip, Holohan notes, her six-year-old daughter looked out her window and noticed a ""rectangular box of light fl oating in mid-air, fl ashes of color darting across its surface-foreign yet familiar.""1 After observing that the television in the passing car ""looked like magic, "" the child and her mother began playing a game of ""How many TVs can we fi nd in cars?"" Later, as her daughter fell asleep, Holohan found herself with a growing sense of anxiety as she thought about the presence of portable televisions and DVD players in automobiles. It was not the threat to physical safety that primarily concerned Holohan-although she does mention the ""sacred reverence"" we each should have while driving-but rather the threat it represented to her family's (and other families') social dynamics. After recalling the road trips she had taken as a child with her father, Holohan observed that only in the ""sacred space"" of the car's interior had she ever felt able to ask her father life's ""big questions."" In effect, Holohan mused, not only would such mobile media make ubiquitous what should be dosed out in small portions, but they would ultimately lead to the disappearance of a sublime arena for family interaction and ""informal education."" Holohan warns us that driving should never be equated with sitting on the living room couch as even a drive through the neighborhood provides ""an opportunity to glimpse our environment outside of ourselves, to refl ect on an experience that is uniquely human.""2 The space of mobility is here an arena worthy of argument. Holohan's essay, to the degree that it is an example of a genre of refl ections on the value and use of portable DVD players-especially as used in cars-is signifi cant in a number of ways. First, on perhaps the most basic level, the article is a representative anecdote of the general cultural anxiety that consistently accompanies the growing use of any new medium (or new use of an existing medium). As Douglas Thomas and Marita Sturken put it, new communication technologies and new uses of existing technologies have been historically accompanied by both utopian claims concerning how they will improve our shared human condition and dystopian fears ""that actual human connection has been irretrievably lost.""3 More signifi cantly, however, and I will pursue this concern throughout the chapter, Holohan's comments represent one side of a public debate over media use that ultimately concerns the contours of what Toby Miller has referred to as the ""well-tempered self, "" that manageable, cultural subject formed and governed through institutions and discourses.4 Given that the automobile and information technologies complicate the meanings of public and private (rather than having a solely destructive infl uence), as Mimi Sheller and John Urry point out in the opening epigraph, public debates over these technologies are, in effect, also arguments over what it means to be ""in public"" and how one is to behave publicly. As they are arguments, the meaning, indeed, changes over time. While television since its inception has been understood as a technology through which individuals come to understand ideological norms and disciplinary images, automobiles-because of the ways they are regulated and disciplined by government rules, institutions, and public discourse-are also implicated in webs of ideological meaning. Hence, both television monitors and automobiles simultaneously act as individualizing prosthetics and purveyors of ideological norms and the regulations of govern-mentality. As a result, the public discussion over the costs/benefi ts of their joint usage should tell us something about contemporary values and norms of citizenship. The link between technologies of mobility and communication quite rightly has taken center stage in many contemporary critical projects.5 As Jeremy Packer puts it, the discourse surrounding mobility and the safety of mobile subjects ultimately concerns the safety, security, and good health of the citizen: ""How we conduct ourselves as mobile subjects and how we construct mobilizations is related to how we enable ourselves as citizens, neighbors, and intellectuals.""6 For instance, in a reading of mass mediated representations of the introduction of the Segway, James Hay and Packer think through the ways ""communication and transportation have been and are being conjugated and linked"" and discussed in political terms of freedom and governance.7 In general, technologies of physical movement and technologies of communication/information movement (e.g., CB radios, cell phones) are discussed both in terms of individual ""freedom"" and in terms of public safety/public responsibility. Packer and Hay moreover suggest that investigations of ""the portability of media and communication technologies"" and ""the material attachment of these technologies to technologies of transport"" are linked to discussions of what matters to a culture in terms of the well-behaved citizen.8 Citizenship is not ""dead"" or in decline; the public is not dead; however, our understanding of each and their interconnections have been altered by public/private modalities. Perhaps we could speak, then, of ""modalities of citizenship"" rather than citizenship itself. Given the multiple ties between the cultural understandings of our means of physical mobility (e.g., the way automobiles are understood ideologically and culturally) and metaphoric mobility (e.g., the ways media may be seen as ""extensions of humanity"" in space and time), the public discourse surrounding the use of television/DVD players within cars leads to discussions about the appropriate behavior of citizens in general. Moreover, given the large degree to which portable and mobile DVD players are utilized by children-highly regulated and protected citizens-it is also the case that the discourse surrounding the use of television/DVD players in cars tells us something about our contemporary expectations of, or battles over, proper child rearing. In effect, by investigating the discourse surrounding portable DVD players in cars, I provide a critical snapshot of our understanding of the appropriate ways in which citizens and budding citizens are expected to employ these particular mediated ""prosthetic"" devices as well as the ways these prosthetics are seen as shaping their ""users."" In the spirit of the introduction (by Daniel Brouwer and Robert Asen) to this volume, I want to stress that this snapshot is a framing of the values expected of citizens and their behavior. Moreover, the valence of these values is a mixed bag, encouraging the critic (here, me) to provide a reading that works according to my own concerns about how a collective people should behave. © 2010 by The University of Alabama Press.

,Comparison Of Rates Of Perceived Exertion Between Active Video Games And Traditional Exercise,"Background: Research regarding the Nintendo Wii™ has focused on rehabilitation and balance benefits as well as energy expenditure for games such as boxing and tennis. There is a gap, however, in the literature regarding perceived exertion of the Wii™ compared to other modes of exercise. Research question: The purpose of this laboratory-based study was to compare perceived exertion on the Nintendo Wii™ and two traditional modes of exercise: the treadmill and cycle ergometer. It was expected that the Wii™ would show lower ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) values. Type of study: A repeated measures design was used. Methods: Five healthy males (average age = 21.4 years) and seven females (average age = 22.1 years) completed three 20 minute exercise sessions in random order, one each using the cycle ergometer, the treadmill and the Nintendo Wii Fit Plus™. Exercise intensity was fixed at 65% (± 5 bpm) of each participant's age predicted maximum heart rate. Ratings of perceived exertion and HR were measured every minute. Additionally overall RPE was collected at the end of each trial. Results: Repeated measures analysis of variance confirmed that although exercise intensity was consistent across the three exercise methods, overall RPE was lowest for the Nintendo Wii™ (9.50) followed by the treadmill (9.92) and finally the cycle ergometer (11.08), F (1,11) = 10.17, p&lt;0.01. Conclusions: When compared to certain traditional exercise modalities the Nintendo Wii Fit Plus™ was perceived to require less effort.

,Contemporary Art Center Córdoba,"Architecture constantly nourishes itself with images hidden in our memory, ideas which become sharp and clear and unexpectedly mark the beginning of a project. Perhaps this is why the echo of the Hispano-lslamic culture, which is still latent in Cordoba, has subconsciously signified more than a footnote to our proposal. In the face of the homogeneity imposed by our global civilisation, in all aspects of life, the Centre of Contemporary Art aspires to interpret a very different western culture, going beyond the cliche of this expression so frequently used. Distrusting the supposed efficacy and flexibility of a neutral and universal container, nowadays commonly used, allows us to imagine a building closely linked to a place and to a distant memory, where every space is individually shaped, and to a time which can transform itself and expand in sequence with different dimensions, uses and spatial qualities. We have always been admirers of the hidden geometric laws through which those artists, artisans and master builders of a remote Islamic past were capable of creating, the multiple and isotropic spaces within the Mosque; a building facetted with vaults and muqarna windows, permutations of ornamental motifs with lattice windows, paving and ataurique decorations, or the rules and narrative rhythms implicit in the poems and tales of Islamic tradition. Like those literary structures which feature a story within a story, often within yet another- a story without an end -we conceived the project as beginning with a system, a law generated by a repeating geometric pattern, that would originate in a hexagonal shape, which then in turn contains three different types of rooms, of 150 m2, 90 m2, and 60 m2. Like a combinatorial game, the permutations of these three areas would generate sequences of different spaces that can possibly come to create a single exhibition area. The artists' workshops on the ground floor and the laboratories on the upper floor are located adjacent to the exhibition halls, to the point where there is no strict difference between them: artistic works can be exhibited in the workshops while the exhibition halls can also be used as areas for artistic production. The assembly room - the black box-is designed as a stage area suitable for theatrical productions, conferences, film screenings, or even for audiovisual exhibitions. The Centre of Contemporary Art is not a centralised organism: its centre moves from one area to another, it is everywhere. It is designed as a sequence of rooms linked to a public walkway, where the different functions of the building come together. Conceived as a crossroads and meeting place, it is a communal area for exhibitions and exchange of ideas, to view an installation, see exhibitions, visit the cafe, use the mediateque, wait for the start of a show in the black box, or perhaps gaze at the Guadalquivir river. The materials coalesce to suggest the character of an art factory, which pervades the entire project. Throughout the interior, walls and slabs of concrete and continuous concrete floors establish a spatial area capable of being transformed at individual points using different forms of intervention. A network of electrical, digital, audio and lighting infrastructures creates the possibility of multiple views and connections everywhere. Outside, the building aspires to express itself through one material: GRC prefabricated panels that at the same time clad the opaque and perforated facades, or make up the flat and sloping roofs of the halls. The industrialised concept of the system as well as the conditions of impermeability, insulation and lightness of the material, contribute to guarantee the precision and rationality of its execution but also play a part in the interconnected concept that governs the whole project. The facade that faces onto the river, a true mask that protagonizes the exterior facade of the building, is conceived as a screen perforated by several polygonal openings with LED-type monochromatic maps behind them. With an appropriate computer programme, video signals will generate images and texts that will be reflected on the river's surface and enable installations specifically conceived for the place. During the day, natural light will filter through the perforations and penetrate the interior covered walkway. In the Centre for Contemporary Art, artists, visitors, experts, researchers and the public, will meet as in a contemporary zouk, without an obvious spatial hierarchy. It will be a centre for creative artistic processes that will closely link the architectural space with the public: an open laboratory where architecture attempts to provoke new modes of expression. Some of the most recent artistic proposals linked to the most recent technologies appear to move away from materiality and submerge themselves in a virtuality disconnected from a concrete place, but perhaps through it, disagreeing with this interpretation - which has become a commonplace - we are convinced that the building itself, the Guadalquivir river, the present and the past of Cordoba, will not simply be a casual circumstance but, as it has been for us as well, will be the start of a dialogue, agreement, or perhaps rejection. For are these not also emotions that underlie the search for all artistic expression?.",eid,2-s2.0-84876875512,Scopus,Space,Sobejano N.,2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Continuing Medical Education Cardiovascular Response Of Marathoners To Mental Challenge,"The effects of long-distance running on cardiovascular responses to mental stress were measured in a group of 12 male marathoners and compared with a group of age-matched healthy males. The stress tests consisted of a video game, a reaction time test, and a 90-second cold pressor test. The marathoners were a well-trained group that ran more than 69 miles per week and had significantly lower resting heart rates (HR) (49.4 ± 13.4 beats/min, P ≤.01) and higher stroke volume indexes (SVI) (63.5 ± 17.5 ml, P ≤.01) than the control group (HR, 65.3 ± 13.8 beats/min; SVI, 45.6 ± 12.8 ml). Resting blood pressure (BP) for the marathoners was 119/75 ± 10/6 mm Hg and 119/73 ± 11/5 mm Hg for the comparison group. The average BP increase was 21/13 mm Hg for the marathoners and 19/13 mm Hg for the aged-matched group. Two marathoners were found to be hypertensive.

,Development Of Believable Bots In Videogames Capable Of Learning During Runtime,"In this paper we show that, thanks to the features of Continuous-Time Recurrent Neural Network (CTRNNs), whose neurons act at different activation level of time, the controller of a bot is capable of learning during runtime in the UT2004 videogame environment without changing any of the network parameters. This behaviour has been described in simple forms of life (e.g. examples of the small nematode worm C. elegans, evidence for the formation of associations between temperatures and food has been known for quite some time) and, in this paper, we adapt these ideas applying them to a current commercial video game. The particular experimental conditions are as following: A bot is evolved in a task where it needs to search and discriminate its base camp and the enemy's camp and associate them with the altitude where the camp is, depending on its experience. The task requires either instrumental or classical conditioned response to be learned. In the last part of the paper is analytically analyzed the best- evolved agent's behaviour and, also, it is explained how some ideas and methodologies that come from models of biological theory, can be easily adapted to the control of virtual characters or ""bots"", i.e. synthetic agents with human behaviour. © 2014 by IJAI (CESER PUBLICATIONS).",eid,2-s2.0-84901338983,Scopus,International Journal of Artificial Intelligence,"Castillo L.F., Bedia M.G., Isaza G., Velez J., Seron F.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Digital Gaming And Language Learning: Autonomy And Community,"The relationship between digital game play and second language (L2) learning is a particularly tricky issue in East Asia. Though there is an emerging presence of Chinese online games, many more young people are playing the English- or Japanese-language versions of the most popular commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) video games. In other words, most Chinese gamers are playing L2 digital games in their leisure time. Informed by research on out-of-class L2 learning, this paper discusses findings from an exploratory study investigating L2 gaming and learning practices in young people's everyday lives. Drawing on rich data from gaming sessions, stimulated recall, focus group discussion, individual interviews and online discussion forums, this paper argues that gamers exercise autonomy by managing their gameplay both as leisure and learning practices in different dimensions (location, formality, locus of control, pedagogy and trajectory). At the same time, gameplay-as-learning practices are supported by wider communities of digital gamers who take on roles as language teachers and advisers. The paper suggests that activities in these dimensions mediated learning autonomously and from community, and discusses the research and pedagogical implications for L2 gaming and learning. © Alice Chik.",eid,2-s2.0-84901217961,Scopus,Language Learning and Technology,Chik A.,2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Eammo: An Environmental Agent Model For Multiple Objects,"Many conventional object-oriented models suffer problems in the representation of multiple objects. A multiple object is an object with multiple aspects, autonomy, and pro-activeness. This paper proposes a new agent model which applies the agent-oriented paradigm to represent multiple objects. This agent model consists of three types of agents as follows: (1) an upper-agent which describes an autonomous and dynamic object; (2) a lower-agent which describes a reactive and static object; and (3) an environmental-agent which describes the environment of the other agents. As an example, we model soccer players (a kind of multiple objects) in EAMMO. Three kinds of soccer agents are constructed with different powers. We simulate the soccer games to confirm the effectiveness of our model. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.",eid,2-s2.0-0032138529,Scopus,Information and Software Technology,"Ito N., Nakagawa K., Hotta T., Du X., Ishii N.",1998,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Ecological Dynamics Of Strategic Species In Game World,"This paper presents an ecological model system of a population of game players, called Game World. Each player plays against its neighbors according to a strategy encoded on a chromosome. Selection and reproduction procedures are applied to the players, resulting in the next generation. Players with the same strategy form a strategic species. Ecological dynamics are created by changes in the relations between groups of different species and show a diversity of spatial and temporal phenomena. The game is a variant of the Prisoner's Dilemma. The ecological dynamics under different environments were studied. The simulation produces interesting phenomena, for example, a phase-transition from an antagonistic society to a cooperative one and an intermittent explosion/extinction of societies.",eid,2-s2.0-0026994255,Scopus,Fujitsu Scientific and Technical Journal,"Adachi Nobue, Matsuo Kazuhiro",1992,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia

,Emotional Gaming,"In recent years, research on the psychology of gaming has examined the negative and positive outcomes of playing video games. Thus far, a variety of affective phenomena have been investigated. In this chapter we will continue this exploration by examining the emotions elicited by the act of playing video games. Because the study of emotions must rely on different type of methods, including subjective self-reports (e.g., description of feelings), neuropsychophysiological measurements (e.g. electromyography, skin conductance, heart rate, event-related potentials, functional magnetic resonance imaging), biological markers (e.g. cortisol, testosterone) and behaviours (e.g., facial expressions), we will cover all these distinct methods. We will explore how dimensional and categorical models of emotions have been used to identify the emotional responses of players, including their enjoyment experience. Expanding upon past research findings we will also discuss the social implications of gaming and suggest areas for future research. © 2013 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",eid,2-s2.0-84897293913,Scopus,Psychology of Gaming,"Madeira F., Arriaga P., Adrião J., Lopes R., Esteves F.",2013,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Emotionally Expressive Agents,"The ability to express emotions is important for creating believable interactive characters. To simulate emotional expressions in an interactive environment, an intelligent agent needs both an adaptive model for generating believable responses, and a visualization model for mapping emotions into facial expressions. Recent advances in intelligent agents and in facial modeling have produced effective algorithms for these tasks independently. In this paper, we describe a method for integrating these algorithms to create an interactive simulation of an agent that produces appropriate facial expressions in a dynamic environment. Our approach to combining a model of emotions with a facial model represents a first step towards developing the technology of a truly believable interactive agent, which has a wide range of applications from designing intelligent training systems to video games and animation tools.",eid,2-s2.0-0032591828,Scopus,"Computer Animation, Conference Proceedings","El-Nasr Magy Seif, Ioerger Thomas R., Yen John, House Donald H., Parke Frederic I.",1999,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia

Most existing methodologies to teach people with ASD to recognize expressions use still images, and do not take into account that facial expressions have movement. We propose a new approach that uses state of the art technology to solve the problem and to improve interactivity. It is based on an avatar-user interaction model with real time response, which builds upon the patient-therapist relationship: it is designed to be used by the therapist and the patient.

,Framework Of Controlling 3D Virtual Human Emotional Walking Using Bci,"A Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is the device that can read and acquire the brain activities. A human body is controlled by Brain-Signals, which considered as a main controller. Furthermore, the human emotions and thoughts will be translated by brain through brain signals and expressed as human mood. This controlling process mainly performed through brain signals, the brain signals is a key component in electroencephalogram (EEG). Based on signal processing the features representing human mood (behavior) could be extracted with emotion as a major feature. This paper proposes a new framework in order to recognize the human inner emotions that have been conducted on the basis of EEG signals using a BCI device controller. This framework go through five steps starting by classifying the brain signal after reading it in order to obtain the emotion, then map the emotion, synchronize the animation of the 3D virtual human, test and evaluate the work. Based on our best knowledge there is no framework for controlling the 3D virtual human. As a result for implementing our framework will enhance the game field of enhancing and controlling the 3D virtual humans’ emotion walking in order to enhance and bring more realistic as well. Commercial games and Augmented Reality systems are possible beneficiaries of this technique. © 2015 Penerbit UTM Press.

,Games Of Drones: The Uneasy Future Of The Soldier-Hero In Call Of Duty: Black Ops Ii,"In this article, I argue that the first-person shooter video game, Call of Duty: Black Ops II, reflects the U.S. military's transition as it reimagines the soldier's role in war. In the age of drone technology, this role shifts from a position of strength to one of relative weakness. Although video games that feature future combat often ""function as virtual enactments and endorsements for developing military technologies,"" Black Ops II offers a surprisingly complex vision of the future of drones and U.S. soldiers (Smicker 2009: 107). To explore how the game reflects a contemporary vision of the U.S. military, I weave together a close textual reading of two levels in Black Ops II with actual accounts from drone pilots and politicians that illuminate the nature of drone combat. Although there are moments in Black Ops II in which avatars combat enemies with first-hand firepower, the experience of heroic diegetic violence is superseded by a combat experience defined by powerlessness, boredom, and ambiguous pleasure. The shift of the soldier from imposing hero to a banal figure experiences its logical conclusion in Unmanned, an independent video game that foregrounds the mundane, nonviolent nature of drone piloting. Instead of training soldiers to withstand emotionally devastating experiences of death and violence first-hand (or to physically enact such violence), games like Black Ops II and Unmanned train actual and potential soldiers to tolerate monotony and disempowerment. © The author(s), 2014.",eid,2-s2.0-84904970496,Scopus,Surveillance and Society,Andersen C.,2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia

,Limits Of Economic And Strategic Rationality For Agents And Ma Systems,"AI adoption of the game-theoretic paradigm although motivated and productive, suffers from basic limits for modelling autonomous agents and MA systems. First, we briefly restate game-theory's role for DAI and MAS: the introduction of formal prototypical social situations (""games""); the use of formal and sound notions, a self-interested view of autonomous agents, etc. Then, a number of criticisms, that have an impact on modelling intelligent social/individual action, are examined: the economicist interpretation of rationality; its instrumentalist conception, which leaves implicit the ends of agents' choices; the consequent multiple equilibria allowed by the theory; the context-unboundedness of rationality. Some contributions for a more heterarchic, context-bounded, architecture of rational agent are given, and a goal-based strategy, as distinct from a strictly utilitarian principle of decision-making, is proposed. Troubles of game-theory with multi-agent systems and in particular with modelling ""cooperation"" are outlined. Finally, some limits inherent in the notion of ""incentive engineering"" are pointed out. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

No study has compared Wii play to a bout of physical activity, assessed ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) or hedonics (liking) of Wii play. Purpose: To determine if VO2, heart rate (HR), RPE and liking of playing Nintendo Wii Sports Boxing was greater than sedentary video game play and treadmill walking in adults. Methods: Twelve healthy males (N=6) and females (N=6) (31.5 ± 12.4 yeas old) had their HR and VO2 assessed during four, 10-minute conditions: rest, walking on a treadmill at 2.5 miles·hr-1, playing a sedentary video game, and playing Wii Sports Boxing. RPE (Borg scale) and liking were assessed during the treadmill walking and video game conditions. Results: Average HR (121.2 ± 12.4 beats·min-1 Wii, 94.1 ± 13.4 beats·min-1 next greatest), VO2 (15.4 ± 4.5 ml·kg-1·min-1 Wii, 10.4 ± 0.9 ml·kg-1·min-1 next greatest), RPE (13.3 ± 1.7 Wii, 9.8 ± 1.7 next greatest) and liking (9.1 ± 1.0 cm Wii, 5.6 ± 3.2 cm next greatest) were significantly greater for Nintendo Wii (P≤0.001 for all) than all other conditions.

,Prediction Of Resting Cardiovascular Functioning In Youth With Family Histories Of Essential Hypertension: A 5-Year Follow-Up,"Two hundred forty-six children (96 Whites, of whom 51 were males; 150 African-Americans, of whom 69 were males) with a familial history of essential hypertension (EH) were re-evaluated 5 years after an initial evaluation. During the initial visit, anthropometric, demographic, and resting cardiovascular (CV) parameters (designated initial baseline levels) were assessed. These CV parameters (systolic and diastolic blood pressure [BP], heart rate, cardiac output index [CI], and total peripheral resistance index [TPRI]) were also measured during postural challenge, a video game challenge, and a cold pressor task. At follow-up, resting CV parameters were again evaluated, and designated as follow-up resting levels. Moderate temporal stability (r range = .43-.56) was observed for all resting CV parameters. Mean stress responses for each CV parameter for all 3 stressors during the initial visit were positively related to the respective CV follow-up resting level. BP stress responses to postural change and video game challenge were found to be significant independent predictors of future resting BP after controlling for standard EH risk factors. Follow-up resting CI was not predicted by any stress responses, whereas follow-up resting TPRI was predicted by TPRI responses to the video game after controlling for standard EH risk factors. These results contrast with those from an earlier 1-year follow-up, where stress responses for neither CI nor TPRI predicted follow-up resting levels. It appears that, as children get older, TPRI stress responses play a stronger role in vasoconstrictive function.",eid,2-s2.0-0000141459,Scopus,International Journal of Behavioral Medicine,"Treiber F.A., Turner J.R., Davis H., Strong W.B.",1997,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Quaternions - Correcting For Geometric Distortion In Dynamic Seismic And Satellite Testing,"Seismic testing sometimes requires significant roll, pitch, and yaw rotations from their MDOF vibration test systems when reproducing certain reference waveform vectors on seismic tables that are associated with particular seismic environments. When these reference waveforms (typically accelerations) are used for such testing, significant rotational motion of the test system's shake table can occur. As a result, the X, Y, and Z control transducers that are mounted on the surface of the table will no longer be aligned with the world (fixed) coordinate system as the table rotates about X, Y, and Z, but rather with respect to the shake table's body (moving) coordinate system. This lack of alignment with respect to the world coordinate system in turn causes geometric distortion in the output of the control accelerometers that are required to control such MDOF tests. These errors can cause further errors in the control system's ability to reproduce the motion specified by the test's reference waveforms with respect to the world coordinate system as required by the seismic test specifications. Similar problems can also occur in other such applications of MDOF testing with reference acceleration waveforms that similarly produces significant roll, pitch, or yaw rotations with their tests. This article presents methods based on the use of quaternions to correct the resulting control transducer measurement distortions. Quaternions are also used widely in physics, guidance and control, kinematics, robotics, autonomous cars, video games, and general graphics applications.",eid,2-s2.0-84950269816,Scopus,Sound and Vibration,Underwood M.A.,2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia

Our algorithm applied to video source from IPCAM and WEBCAM would be the TRNG, and be the PRNG when applied to a MPEG-1 videochip. When applying NIST SP 800-22 Rev.1a 15 statistics tests to the random numbers generated from our single source algorithm, 98% random numbers generated from IPCAM and WEBCAM can pass 15 statistical tests, but only 72.7% random numbers generated from a MPEG-1 videochip can pass 15 statistical tests. However, once adopting our dual-source algorithm on the MPEG-1 videochip to obtain random numbers, the passing rate against 15 statistical tests will rise up to 98%.

,Sequentially Dependent Meta-Constraint Satisfaction Problem: An Application To Video Games,"A Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) consists in a sequence of variables holding a domain of possible values and relations among these variables called constraints. A meta-CSP can be seen as a metaproblem whose decomposition leads to a set of CSPs. The meta-variables correspond to sub-problems of the original problem, and a meta-constraint is a relation among those meta-variables. Meta-CSPs find many applications in industry, usually in processes that involve time and actions such as the control of a robot, a manufacturing process, or the scheduling of any common activity. In this paper, we introduce the notion of Sequentially Dependent Meta-CSP (SD Meta-CSP), which extends the meta-CSP in order to support applications where a dependency between sub-problems is mandatory. In this case, the meta-CSP is decomposed into a set of sub-problems {Pi, Pi+1, . . . , Pn}, but the instance of the sub-problem Pi+1 sequentially depends on the solution of the sub-problem Pi . In this work we provide a formal definition for the SD Meta-CSPs, a framework to handle it, and we illustrate its applicability to video games. In particular, we model and implement agents as SD Meta-CSPs able to autonomously play two classic games: Ms. Pac-Man and Super Mario Bros.",eid,2-s2.0-84923933033,Scopus,Romanian Journal of Information Science and Technology,"Soto R., Crawford B., Monfroy E., Paredes F.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Lydia

Since the muscular endurance training in the training mode requires the user to keep the same posture, the computing mode for consumed calories in the training mode and game mode was different. A comparison curve was made based on several training records and history data to analyze the exercise condition of the user.

,Tangible Influence: Towards A New Interaction Paradigm For Computer Games,"As AI techniques become more widespread in computer games, and the area of synthetic characters matures, avatars in such computer games also tend to gain autonomy and become more clever. However, this autonomy may bring also some change in the interaction between users and game characters. Players may become less in charge of their characters and lose the power of complete motion or behavior control. On the other hand, characters may become more clever exhibiting much more interesting autonomous actions and behaviors. This paper presents, defines and discusses the concept of ""influence"", as an alternative to ""direct"" control of game characters, describing how influence can be achieved in computer games. To illustrate the notion of ""influence"" we will present a game called FantasyA where players interact with it by influencing the emotions of they semi-autonomous avatars using a tangible interface called SenToy.

Efforts to increase physical activity can include active video games. While many active video games demonstrate exertion levels commensurate with light to moderate exercise, it is unclear whether these games can meet requirements for vigorous activity. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the active video game, Dance Dance Revolution (DDR), can provide vigorous exercise in a wide range of adults. Twelve adults (18 to 53 yrs, BMI 18 to 37) were studied while playing DDR at an advanced level. Metabolic measures were collected during a 30 min game-play protocol at the advanced ""Heavy"" level of difficulty. Mean values achieved were the following: 8 METs, heart rate 157 beats·min-1, and energy expenditure 9 kcal·min-1. DDR is played similarly to that of interval type exercise where each game-song is followed by a brief rest period. Subjects reported that DDR is fun, and that the competitive nature of playing with others is enjoyable.

,Interactive Learning For Sequential Decisions And Predictions,"Sequential prediction problems arise commonly in many areas of robotics and information processing: e.g., predicting a sequence of actions over time to achieve a goal in a control task, interpreting an image through a sequence of local image patch classifications, or translating speech to text through an iterative decoding procedure.    Learning predictors that can reliably perform such sequential tasks is challenging. Specifically, as predictions influence future inputs in the sequence, the data-generation process and executed predictor are inextricably intertwined. This can often lead to a significant mismatch between the distribution of examples observed during training (induced by the predictor used to generate training instances) and test executions (induced by the learned predictor). As a result, naively applying standard supervised learning methods—that assume independently and identically distributed training and test examples—often leads to poor test performance and compounding errors: inaccurate predictions lead to untrained situations where more errors are inevitable.    This thesis proposes general iterative learning procedures that leverage interactions between the learner and teacher to provably learn good predictors for sequential prediction tasks. Through repeated interactions, our approaches can efficiently learn predictors that are robust to their own errors and predict accurately during test executions. Our main approach uses existing no-regret online learning methods to provide strong generalization guarantees on test performance.    We demonstrate how to apply our main approach in various sequential prediction settings: imitation learning, model-free reinforcement learning, system identification, structured prediction and submodular list predictions. Its efficiency and wide applicability are exhibited over a large variety of challenging learning tasks, ranging from learning video game playing agents from human players and accurate dynamic models of a simulated helicopter for controller synthesis, to learning predictors for scene understanding in computer vision, news recommendation and document summarization. We also demonstrate the applicability of our technique on a real robot, using pilot demonstrations to train an autonomous quadrotor to avoid trees seen through its onboard camera (monocular vision) when flying at low-altitude in natural forest environments.    Our results throughout show that unlike typical supervised learning tasks where examples of good behavior are sufficient to learn good predictors, interaction is a fundamental part of learning in sequential tasks. We show formally that some level of interaction is necessary, as without interaction, no learning algorithm can guarantee good performance in general.",pq_id,1461396137,proquest_dt,NA,"Ross, Stephane",2013,THES,Ph.D.,reviewer1,Lydia
,Modeling Behavior And Variation For Crowd Animation,"The simulation of crowds of virtual characters is needed for applications such as films, games, and virtual reality environments. These simulations are difficult due to the large number of characters to be simulated and the requirement for synthesizing realistic human-like motion efficiently. This thesis focuses on two problems: how to search through and select motion clips of behaviors so that human-like motion can be generated for multiple characters interactively, and how to model and synthesize variation in motion data.    Given a collection of blendable segmented motion clips derived from motion capture or keyframed animation, this thesis explores novel ways to apply heuristic search algorithms to generate goal-driven navigation motion for virtual humanlike characters. Motion clips are organized and interconnected through a behavior graph that encodes the possible actions of a character. A planning approach is used to search over these possible actions to efficiently generate motion. This technique works well for synthesizing animations of multiple characters navigating autonomously in large dynamic environments.    In addition, this thesis introduces a novel planning approach based on precomputation that is more efficient than traditional forward search methods. We present a technique for precomputing large and diverse trees, and describe a backward search method used during runtime to solve planning queries. This new approach allows us to develop an interactive animation system that supports a large number of characters simultaneously.    Finally, this thesis addresses the issue of motion variation. Current state-of-the-art crowd simulations often use a few specific motion clips or repeated cycles of a particular motion to continuously animate multiple characters. The idea of synthesizing the subtle variations in motion data has been largely unexplored, as previous work considers variation to be an additive noise component. This thesis instead uses a data-driven approach and applies learning techniques to this problem. Given a small number of input motions, we model the data with a Dynamic Bayesian Network, and synthesize new spatial and temporal variants that are statistically similar to the inputs.",pq_id,304864473,proquest_dt,NA,"Lau, Manfred Chung Man",2009,THES,Ph.D.,reviewer1,Lydia
,Motivation And Discourse In A Literate Environment: A Case Study Of A Young Adult Library,"This case study of the Young Adult section of a public library employed the Self-Determination Theory and discourse analysis to determine the elements of the social context that contribute to adolescents’ motivation to read and write, and how the needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness are met as expressed through three adolescents’ literate identities. The two key elements for motivation were found—access to preferred genre and social interaction--while the adolescents demonstrated different needs satisfaction independently and in relationship to the Young Adult section and school contexts. Adolescents’ use of online text was dominated by three types of text—social networking, gaming, and other sites. Teens were found to use the text in their live discourse in five ways: reference, authority, experience, expression, and instrument. This discourse at the computers built friendships and explored sexual identities. The author questions whether incorporation of out-of-school literacies is possible on a broad scale if they are to maintain their attached discourses and meet the teens’ expectations to be prepared for the workplace.",pq_id,304918628,proquest_dt,NA,"Berg, Margaret A.",2009,THES,Ph.D.,reviewer1,Lydia
,Probabilistic Distributed Control,"Algorithms must not only allow autonomous entities to work together to accomplish some desired task, but it is often advantageous to must do so in a distributed manner. The latter criterion is critical. As the number of autonomous entities increases, it becomes increasingly unwieldy to coordinate them with a centralized controller due to scalability issues.    The natural question is thus ""What distributed control algorithm can we use for this purpose?"" As it turns out, in 1964 the mathematician M.L. Tsetlin devised a very elegant solution, which he called the Gur Game, to bring about ""optimality"" in a population of finite state automata without using a centralized controller. What is remarkable about his methodology is that it so closely parallels what we are trying to accomplish now with networks of computing entities. It is because of this that we have chosen to further investigate how the Gur Game can realize distributed control. Since the Gur Game works in a probabilistic manner, we will use the phrase ""probabilistic distributed control"" to describe this work. Indeed, it is the thesis of this dissertation that the Gur Game is an effective means to achieve probabilistic distributed control in many network applications.    In this dissertation, our first application of the Gur Game is to the problem of adjusting the resolution of active entities in ad hoc networks, such as sensor networks. We next present an extension of the Gur Game that we call the Hierarchical Gur Game. This Hierarchical Gur Game addresses some scalability issues associated with the baseline (flat) Gur Game. We next study how the Gur Game can be used in the domain of power control for ad hoc networks. Next, we examine the concept of the Gur Game duty cycle. Following that we explore what happens when we break the original Gur Game into separate, smaller games. We also demonstrate how allowing gurs to be mobile helps provide robustness in a tree hierarchy network. Finally, we analyze the Gur Game theoretically.",pq_id,304653068,proquest_dt,NA,"Iyer, Ranjit",2008,THES,Ph.D.,reviewer1,Lydia
,Rain In Vision And Graphics.,"Rain produces sharp intensity fluctuations in images and videos which severely degrade the performance of outdoor vision systems. Removing the visual effects of rain is therefore important in order to make outdoor vision robust to rain. In contrast, in graphics, rain effects are desirable as they are often used to convey scene emotions in movies and in other graphics applications, such as games, to enhance realism. Developing efficient algorithms for realistic rendering of rain effects is however challenging. This thesis, studies rain from the perspective of vision and graphics. We have two main goals - (1)to understand the visual appearance of rain and (2)to develop efficient algorithms both for handling its effects in vision and for its realistic rendering in graphics. We begin by modeling the visual appearance of rain. We describe the appearance by modeling the photometric intensities produced by individual raindrops and the space-time correlation produced by the motion of a large number of rain drops. We then use these appearance models to develop two complementary approaches to handle the effects of rain on vision systems. The first approach uses a post-processing algorithm for detection and removal of rain from videos that have already been captured. In the second approach we use our appearance model to show that the unique physical properties of rain--its small size, high velocity and spatial distribution--makes its visibility depend strongly on camera parameters. This dependence is used to reduce the visibility of rain during image acquisition by judiciously selecting camera parameters. Conversely, camera parameters can also be chosen to enhance the visibility of rain. This ability can be used to develop an inexpensive and portable camera-based rain gauge that provides instantaneous rain-rate measurements. In graphics, we have developed two models for realistic rendering of rain. In the first model we consider the complex appearance patterns produced by close by raindrops. We show that these patterns are produced due to the rapid shape distortions (i.e. oscillations) that a raindrop undergoes as it falls and develop a physics-based model to faithfully render these complex appearance patterns. This model is then used to develop an efficient algorithm for rendering rain in images and videos. In the second work, we focus on realistic rendering of material-dependent splashing of raindrops. Here we measure raindrop splashes for 22 different realworld materials. These measurements are then used to build a compact stochastic model that accurately captures the material and inclination dependent splashing behavior of raindrops. Additionally, it allows a user to render physically plausible splashes for novel materials that have not been measured. These two methods have advanced the state of the art algorithms for rendering rain. We believe that this thesis presents a new approach for modeling dynamic weather effects and has opened new avenues for research in vision and graphics.",pq_id,33473591,proquest_dt,NA,"Garg, Kshitiz",2008,THES,NA,reviewer1,Lydia
,Synthesis Of Strategies For Non-Zero-Sum Repeated Games,"There are numerous applications that involve two or more self-interested autonomous agents that repeatedly interact with each other in order to achieve a goal or maximize their utilities. This dissertation focuses on the problem of how to identify and exploit useful structures in agents’ behavior for the construction of good strategies for agents in multi-agent environments, particularly non-zero-sum repeated games.   This dissertation makes four contributions to the study of this problem. First, this thesis describes a way to take a set of interaction traces produced by different pairs of players in a two-player repeated game, and then find the best way to combine them into a strategy. The strategy can then be incorporated into an existing agent, as an enhancement of the agent's original strategy. In cross-validated experiments involving 126 agents for the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, Iterated Chicken Game, and Iterated Battle of the Sexes, my technique was able to make improvement to the performance of nearly all of the agents. Second, this thesis investigates the issue of uncertainty about goals when a goal-based agent situated in a nondeterministic environment. The results of this investigation include the necessary and sufficiency conditions for such guarantee, and an algorithm for synthesizing a strategy from interaction traces that maximizes the probability of success of an agent even when no strategy can assure the success of the agent. Third, this thesis introduces a technique, Symbolic Noise Detection (SND), for detecting noise (i.e., mistakes or miscommunications) among agents in repeated games. The idea is that if we can build a model of the other agent’s behavior, we can use this model to detect and correct actions that have been affected by noise. In the 20th Anniversary Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma competition, the SND agent placed third in the “noise” category, and was the best performer among programs that had no ""slave"" programs feeding points to them. Fourth, the thesis presents a generalization of SND that can be wrapped around any existing strategy. Finally, the thesis includes a general framework for synthesizing strategies from experience for repeated games in both noisy and noisy-free environments.",pq_id,304564235,proquest_dt,NA,"Au, Tsz-Chiu",2008,THES,Ph.D.,reviewer1,Lydia

,Cortisol Fluctuates With Increases And Decreases In Negative Affect.,"Prior studies have reported cortisol secretion to be primarily influenced by negative affect, but less is known about cortisol activity during states of activation involving increased positive affect and decreased negative affect. On separate days, 30 healthy young men experienced: an activating and humorous video; a speech stressor; and a resting control period. Cortisol was measured in saliva before and after each 30-min mood induction. Positive affect (activation) was increased similarly by both the video and the speech compared to rest (p < .0001). Negative affect increased during the speech and decreased during the video (p < .001). Cortisol increased only during the speech (p < .0001). Following the video, however, cortisol was decreased significantly (p < .0001). Rest day cortisol revealed no differences across periods (p > .1). These results suggest that the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis is a dynamic system influenced by changes in negative affect irrespective of the experience of generalized activation.",no_id,nagy2015_7,nagy2015,Psychoneuroendocrinology,"Buchanan, T.

,"Individual Differences Affect Hormonal Responses To A Team- Based Violent Videogame Competition, But Not In Solitary Play.","Testosterone levels have been shown to increase in response to interpersonal challenge, and winners of these challenges have been shown to exhibit testosterone increases and cortisol decreases post challenge, whereas losers show decreases in testosterone and increases in cortisol. These challenge responses are thought to facilitate behaviors instrumental in gaining and maintaining status in human and primate dominance hierarchies. However, the vast majority of human studies designed to test this hypothesis have been based on one-on-one competitions, often viewed by teammates or other spectators. The latter introduces an additional social evaluative component to the challenge, on top of the one-on-one competition. It is possible the hormonal responses associated with the challenge response are related to the facilitating or debilitating response to the presence of others and not to the challenge per se. Moreover, few studies have evaluated the challenge response during coalitional competition, which has been important during human evolutionary history. In this study, a violent videogame was used to simulate competition in three different social contexts. The first two were social and consisted of two matches back-to- back. The first match was among the three members of 24 experimentally induced teams, the winner of which then competed against the winner from a different team. In the teammates present condition (12 teams), all teammates remained and observed the winner’s second match, replicating the conditions common to sporting events. In the teammates absent condition (12 teams), teammates were dismissed following the first match and thus were not present during the winner’s match. The third condition was non- social (n = 25); the goal was to remove the social context from the competition, allowing an unconfounded one-on-one challenge response. Further, extroversion, social phobia,social dominance orientation, and a measure of in-group moral reasoning were administered to assess if individual differences on these social dimensions were related to competitors’ social challenge response. In the one-on-one condition, individual differences did not predict hormone levels, nor did testosterone increase for winners but winners had lower pre- and post-match cortisol levels than losers. In the social conditions, better video game performance was associated with higher cortisol, but was not related to testosterone. However, in general cortisol showed decreases across the first match, with individuals who scored highly on the in-group measure showing greater decreases in cortisol. Similarly individuals scoring highly on social phobia showed higher pre-match cortisol which decreased less in the teammates present condition and more in the teammates absent condition. Moreover, extraverts from the teammate’s present condition showed similar cortisol response to the introverts, but extraverts in the absent condition showing lower cortisol than introverts pre-match and post-match. Due to insufficient power, detailed examination of these individual differences effects were not possible for the second match, but there were across match differences in mean hormone levels. Players in the teammate’s present condition had higher testosterone and higher cortisol during the second match than did players in the teammates absent condition. In conclusion, the social conditions, pre- and post-match hormonal responses varied with individual differences in social phobia, extroversion/introversion, and in- group orientation, patterns that were not observed in the non-social condition. Moreover, contrasting the social conditions with the silent condition shows that individuals were mounting a similar stress response to either winning in the social conditions or losing in the silent condition. Otherwise, the null findings from the silent condition are novel and suggest that testosterone changes in response to winning are only relevant with an audience, without which status is irrelevant.",no_id,nagy2015_27,nagy2015,NA,"Oxford, J.

The instrument used in this study was a behavioral coding form used by Silvern et al. (1983a, 1983b) to score the aggressive and prosocial behavior of each subject during a baseline condition and after each treatment condition (i.e., television viewing and video game play in the first study, and competitive and cooperative video game play in the second study). A time sampling method to analyze the video tape recorded play behavior of pairs of subjects was used by two judges with an interrater reliability of .85 or higher. The sample included 26 white, males who were 6- and 7-years old. All subjects participated in the baseline and treatment conditions. Data were analyzed using an analysis of variance repeated measures design. Separate analyses of variance were performed for object and physical aggression. A significant difference was found for object aggression F (2, 50) = 6.06, p < .01. A Sheffe post hoc comparison was performed to determine the origin of the significant difference. This post hoc procedure revealed that the object aggression scores were found to be significantly higher in the baseline condition than in the competitive treatment condition.

The testosterone response to the competition is different in each sex; the cortisol response is the same. Results show that male testosterone rose before the video contest, as if in anticipation of the competition. However, the male Ss did not show the expected postmatch response; male winners' testosterone were no higher than that of male losers. Unlike male testosterone, female testosterone generally decreased throughout the experiment. Trends in testosterone and cortisol are parallel in women, but not in men.

,1-Year Stability And Prediction Of Cardiovascular Functioning At Rest And During Laboratory Stressors In Youth With Family Histories Of Essential Hypertension,"Blood pressure (BP), heart rate, cardiac index, and total peripheral resistance index were measured at rest and in response to postural change, forehead cold stimulation, and a video game challenge in a sample of 128 White and 155 African-American normotensive youth with family histories of essential hypertension (EH). These measurements were readministered 1 year later (12.5 ± 3.2 months). Moderate temporal stability was observed for all resting and absolute stress responses. Reliability estimates for reactivity change scores were lower, although some were within acceptable ranges. African-American youth exhibited greater BP and peripheral resistance index reactivity to forehead cold on both evaluations. After controlling for various anthropometric and demographic parameters and the pertinent previous year's resting cardiovascular (CV) parameter, mean video game systolic blood pressure (SBP) responses were predictive of resting SBP whereas absolute forehead cold and video game diastolic responses predicted resting diastolic blood pressure (DBF) 1 year later. Mean video game DBP responses were also predictive of resting peripheral resistance index after controlling for significant demographic and anthropometric measures.

,A Behavioral Test Of Accepting Benefits That Cost Others: Associations With Conduct Problems And Callous-Unemotionality,"Background: Youth with conduct problems (CP) often make decisions which value self-interest over the interests of others. Self-benefiting behavior despite loss to others is especially common among youth with CP and callous-unemotional traits (CU). Such behavioral tendencies are generally measured using self- or observer-report. We are unaware of attempts to measure this tendency with a behavioral paradigm. Methods/Principal Findings: In our AlAn's (altruism-antisocial) game a computer program presents subjects with a series of offers in which they will receive money but a planned actual charity donation will be reduced; subjects decide to accept or reject each offer. We tested (1) whether adolescent patients with CP (n = 20) compared with adolescent controls (n = 19) differed on AlAn's game outcomes, (2) whether youths with CP and CU differed significantly from controls without CP or CU, and (3) whether AlAn's game outcomes correlated significantly with CP and separately, CU severity. Patients with CP and CU compared with controls without these problems took significantly more money for themselves and left significantly less money in the charity donation; AlAn's game outcomes were significantly correlated with CU, but not CP. Conclusions/Significance: In the AlAn's game adolescents with conduct problems and CU traits, compared with controls without CP/CU, are disposed to benefit themselves while costing others even in a novel situation, devoid of peer influences, where anonymity is assured, reciprocity or retribution are impossible, intoxication is absent and when the ""other"" to be harmed is considered beneficent. AlAn's game outcomes are associated with measures of CU. Results suggest that the AlAn's game provides an objective means of capturing information about CU traits. The AlAn's game, which was designed for future use in the MRI environment, may be used in studies attempting to identify the neural correlates of self-benefiting decision-making. © 2012 Sakai et al.",doi,10.1371/journal.pone.0036158,Scopus,PLoS ONE,"Sakai J.T., Dalwani M.S., Gelhorn H.L., Mikulich-Gilbertson S.K., Crowley T.J.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia

Emotions sit at the heart of a game player’s level of engagement. They are evoked across many of the components that facilitate gameplay including the interface, the player’s avatar, non-player characters and narrative. Understanding the role of emotion in creating truly immersive and believable environments is critical for game designers. After discussing a taxonomy of emotion, this paper will present a systematic literature review of designing for emotion in computer games.

,A Distributed Admission Control Model For Qos Assurance In Large-Scale Media Delivery Systems,"Conventional admission control models incur some performance penalty. First, admission control computation can overload a server that is already heavily loaded. Also, in large-scale media systems with geographically distributed server clusters, performing admission control on each cluster can result in long response latency, if the client request is denied at one site and has to be forwarded to another site. Furthermore, in prefix caching, initial frames cached at the proxy are delivered to the client before the admission decisions are made. If the media server is heavily loaded and, finally, has to deny the client request, forwarding a large number of initial frames is a waste of critical network resources. In this paper, a novel distributed admission control model is presented. We make use of proxy servers to perform the admission control tasks. Each proxy hosts an agent to coordinate the effort. Agents reserve media server's disk bandwidth and make admission decisions autonomously based on the allocated disk bandwidth. We develop an effective game theoretic framework to achieve fairness in the bandwidth allocation among the agents. To improve the overall bandwidth utilization, we also consider an aggressive admission control policy where each agent may admit more requests than its allocated bandwidth allows. The distributed admission control approach provides the solution to the stated problems incurred in conventional admission control models. Experimental studies show that our algorithms significantly reduce the responce latency and the media server load. © 2005 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TPDS.2005.141,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,"Xia Z., Hao W., Yen I.-L., Li P.",2005,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,A Fuzzy-Rule-Based Driving Architecture For Non-Player Characters In A Car Racing Game,"Videogame-based competitions have been the target of considerable interest among researchers over the past few years since they provide an ideal framework in which to apply soft computing techniques. One of the most popular competitions is the Simulated Car Racing Competition which, thanks to the realism implemented by recent car simulators, provides an excellent test bed for the application of autonomous driving techniques. The present work describes the design and implementation of a car controller able to deal with competitive racing situations. The complete driving architecture consists of six simple modules, each one responsible for a basic aspect of car driving. Three modules use simple functions to control gear shifting, steering movements, and pedal positions. A fourth manages speed control by means of a simple fuzzy system. The other two modules are in charge of (i) adapting the driving behaviour to the presence of other cars, and (ii) implementing a basic 'inter-lap' learning mechanism in order to remember key track segments and adapt the speed accordingly in future laps. The controller was evaluated in two ways. First, in runs without adversaries over several track designs, our controller allowed some of the longest distances to be covered in a set time in comparison with data from other previous controllers, and second, as a participant in the 2009 Simulated Car Racing Competition which it ended up winning. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",doi,10.1007/s00500-011-0691-6,Scopus,Soft Computing,"Onieva E., Pelta D.A., Milanés V., Pérez J.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,A Game-Theoretic Approach For Elastic Distributed Data Stream Processing,"Distributed data stream processing applications are structured as graphs of interconnected modules able to ingest high-speed data and to transform them in order to generate results of interest. Elasticity is one of the most appealing features of stream processing applications. Itmakes it possible to scale up/down the allocated computing resources on demand in response to fluctuations of the workload. On clouds, this represents a necessary feature to keep the operating cost at affordable levels while accommodating user-defined QoS requirements. In this article, we study this problem from a game-theoretic perspective. The control logic driving elasticity is distributed among local control agents capable of choosing the right amount of resources to use by each module. In a first step, we model the problem as a noncooperative game in which agents pursue their self-interest. We identify the Nash equilibria and we design a distributed procedure to reach the best equilibrium in the Pareto sense. As a second step, we extend the noncooperative formulation with a decentralized incentive-based mechanism in order to promote cooperation by moving the agreement point closer to the system optimum. Simulations confirm the results of our theoretical analysis and the quality of our strategies. © 2016 ACM.",doi,10.1145/2903146,Scopus,ACM Transactions on Autonomous and Adaptive Systems,Mencagli G.,2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,A Game-Theoretic Power Control Mechanism Based On Hidden Markov Model In Cognitive Wireless Sensor Network With Imperfect Information,"Wireless sensor networks are utilized in medical area to gather multimedia information from multiple sources, such as video streams, images, voice, heartbeat and blood pressure data, which call for higher bandwidth and more available spectrum. Whereas, today's radio spectrum is very crowded for rapid increasing popularities of various wireless applications. Hence, wireless sensor networks utilizing the advantages of cognitive radio technology, namely cognitive wireless sensor network (CWSN), is a promising solution for spectrum scarcity problem. A major challenge in CWSN is maximizing its network lifetime by appropriate power control mechanism. To solve the distributed power control issues in CWSN with imperfect information, a game-theoretic power control mechanism based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is proposed according to the difference and independence of channel sensing results among users of cognitive wireless sensor network (UCWSNs). UCWSNs can use HMM to infer whether its competitors take part in the game, which improves the information accuracy of game and leads to an optimal transmission power. Moreover, to meet the QoS (Quality of Service) of UCWSNs for multimedia information, a utility function based on the tradeoff of signal to interference plus noise ratio and power efficiency is defined for the power control game. Simulation results indicate that the game-theoretic power control mechanism based on HMM can not only improve the power efficiency, but also meet the target SINR better compared with other methods. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",doi,10.1016/j.neucom.2016.03.104,Scopus,Neurocomputing,"Zhu J., Jiang D., Ba S., Zhang Y.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia

,A Human-Machine-Interface Integrating Low-Cost Sensors With A Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation System For Post-Stroke Balance Rehabilitation,"A stroke is caused when an artery carrying blood from heart to an area in the brain bursts or a clot obstructs the blood flow to brain thereby preventing delivery of oxygen and nutrients. About half of the stroke survivors are left with some degree of disability. Innovative methodologies for restorative neurorehabilitation are urgently required to reduce long-term disability. The ability of the nervous system to reorganize its structure, function and connections as a response to intrinsic or extrinsic stimuli is called neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity is involved in post-stroke functional disturbances, but also in rehabilitation. Beneficial neuroplastic changes may be facilitated with non-invasive electrotherapy, such as neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) and sensory electrical stimulation (SES). NMES involves coordinated electrical stimulation of motor nerves and muscles to activate them with continuous short pulses of electrical current while SES involves stimulation of sensory nerves with electrical current resulting in sensations that vary from barely perceivable to highly unpleasant. Here, active cortical participation in rehabilitation procedures may be facilitated by driving the non-invasive electrotherapy with biosignals (electromyogram (EMG), electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculogram (EOG)) that represent simultaneous active perception and volitional effort. To achieve this in a resource-poor setting, e.g., in low- and middle-income countries, we present a low-cost human-machine-interface (HMI) by leveraging recent advances in off-the-shelf video game sensor technology. In this paper, we discuss the open-source software interface that integrates low-cost off-the-shelf sensors for visual- auditory biofeedback with non-invasive electrotherapy to assist postural control during balance rehabilitation. We demonstrate the proof-of- concept on healthy volunteers. © 2016 Journal of Visualized Experiments.",doi,10.3791/52394,Scopus,Journal of Visualized Experiments,"Kumar D., Das A., Lahiri U., Dutta A.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,A Land Surface Model Incorporated With Soil Freeze/Thaw And Its Application In Game/Tibet,"Land surface process is of great importance in global climate change, moisture and heat exchange in the interface of the earth and atmosphere, human impacts on the environment and ecosystem, etc. Soil freeze/thaw plays an important role in cold land surface processes. In this work the diurnal freeze/thaw effects on energy partition in the context of GAME/ Tibet are studied. A sophisticated land surface model is developed, the particular aspect of which is its physical consideration of soil freeze/ thaw and vapor flux. The simultaneous water and heat transfer soil sub-model not only reflects the water flow from unfrozen zone to frozen fringe in freezing/thawing soil, but also demonstrates the change of moisture and temperature field induced by vapor flux from high temperature zone to low temperature zone, which makes the model applicable for various circumstances. The modified Picard numerical method is employed to help with the water balance and convergence of the numerical scheme. Finally, the model is applied to analyze the diurnal energy and water cycle characteristics over the Tibetan Plateau using the Game/Tibet datasets observed in May and July of 1998. Heat and energy transfer simulation shows that: (i) There exists a negative feedback mechanism between soil freeze/thaw and soil temperature/ground heat flux; (ii) during freezing period all three heat fluxes do not vary apparently, in spite of the fact that the negative soil temperature is higher than that not considering soil freeze; (iii) during thawing period, ground heat flux increases, and sensible heat flux decreases, but latent heat flux does not change much; and (iv) during freezing period, soil temperature decreases, though ground heat flux increases. © Science in China Press 2006.",doi,10.1007/s11430-006-2028-3,Scopus,"Science in China, Series D: Earth Sciences","Hu H., Ye B., Zhou Y., Tian F.",2006,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,A Longitudinal Study In Youth Of Heart Rate Variability At Rest And In Response To Stress,"Background: Few longitudinal studies have examined ethnic and sex differences, predictors and tracking stabilities of heart rate variability (HRV) at rest and in response to stress in youths and young adults. Methods: Two evaluations were performed approximately 1.5 years apart on 399 youths and young adults (189 European Americans [EAs] and 210 African Americans [AAs]; 190 males and 209 females). HRV was measured at rest and during a video game challenge. Results: AAs showed significantly higher resting root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) of normal R-R intervals and high-frequency (HF) power than EAs (ps < 0.01). Females displayed larger decrease of RMSSD and HF during video game challenge than males (ps < 0.05). These ethnic and sex differences were consistent across 1.5 years. No significant sex difference of resting HRV or ethnic difference of HRV response to stress was observed. In addition to age, ethnicity or sex, baseline resting HRV or HRV response to stress are predictors of the corresponding variables 1.5 years later (ps < 0.01). Furthermore, weight gain indexed by either body mass index or waist circumference predicts declined resting HRV levels during follow up (ps < 0.05). Tracking stabilities were high (> 0.5) for resting HRV, but relatively low (< 0.3) for HRV in response to stress. Conclusion: AAs show higher resting HRV than EAs, and females display greater HRV response to stress than males; and these ethnic and sex differences are consistent across 1.5 years. Resting HRV declines with weight gain. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

,A Metacognitive Strategy For Reducing Disruptive Behavior In Children With Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders: Gofar Pilot,"BACKGROUND: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are often characterized by disruptive behavior problems and there are few effective interventions available. GoFAR is a novel, 3-part intervention designed to improve self-regulation and adaptive living skills of children with FASD by improving metacognitive control of emotions and arousal.METHODS: The intervention has 3 components: (i) GoFAR: a ""serious game"" designed to teach a metacognitive control strategy in a computer game environment; (ii) parent training on child behavioral regulation; and (iii) Behavior Analog Therapy (BAT) sessions, a practical application of the metacognitive learning methodology by parent and child in the context of learning adaptive skills. The learning strategy (FAR) teaches the child to Focus and make a plan, Act out the plan, and Reflect back on the plan. Thirty families were randomized to 3 groups: (i) GoFAR (n = 10); (ii) FACELAND (n = 10); or (iii) CONTROL (n = 10). The 2 intervention groups, GoFAR and FACELAND, used computer games to instruct children. Both groups also received 5 sessions of parent training followed by 5 sessions of joint parent/child therapy (BAT). Assessment of disruptive behavior, including frequency of temper tantrums, frustration tolerance, impulsivity, destructiveness, aggression, and maintaining attention were carried out before enrollment at Mid-Treatment, when game play and parent training were completed, and finally, after completing the BAT sessions.RESULTS: Parental report of disruptive behavior overall was significantly reduced in the GoFAR group after the first components, game play and parent training, and after the BAT sessions in the FACELAND group with no changes in the CONTROL group over time.CONCLUSIONS: The GoFAR(®) game was well received by children and effective in teaching the required skills. Mastering the FAR metacognitive strategy was associated with a reduction in disruptive behaviors in children with FASD suggesting that effective interventions can improve outcomes for this high-risk group.

,A Mixed Reality System For Kansei-Based Co-Design Of Highly-Customized Products,"We designed a new Computer-Aided Design tool that can be easily and intuitively used by non-expert designers, like users of the products being designed. The target application is the design of highly-customized products together with the final users, more specifically the design of walking assistive devices with mobility-impaired people. The tool has simultaneously been developed with an ad-hoc protocol for an accurate evaluation of the satisfaction of users, through questionnaires and psychophysiological measurements. In fact, costly and complex technical products such as walking assistance devices require ad-hoc design processes to address the specific needs of each user. The characterization of user requirements in the early stage of design remains difficult due to their subjective and communication gap between the user and the designer. To overcome these issues, we propose a new modular digital toolbox that allows co-design between users and designers. The tool is a combination of a mixed reality hardware/software system and kansei (or affective) engineering techniques. The hardware consists of modular Tangible User Interfaces (TUIs), custom-made by 3D printing and powered by a 3D game engine. The interactive content is displayed in mixed reality, simultaneously to the user and the designer. Kansei data of the users are collected through questionnaires and psychophysical measurements during multiple collaboration phases. ©2016-Society for Design and Process Science.All rights reserved.",doi,10.3233/jid-2016-0013,Scopus,Journal of Integrated Design and Process Science,"Arrighi P.-A., Maurya S., Arai K., Moriya K., Mougenot C.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,A Motivational Model Of Video Game Engagement,"More Americans now play video games than go to the movies (NPD Group, 2009). The meteoric rise in popularity of video games highlights the need for research approaches that can deepen our scientific understanding of video game engagement. This article advances a theory-based motivational model for examining and evaluating the ways by which video game engagement shapes psychological processes and influences well-being. Rooted in self-determination theory (Deci & Ryan, 2000; Ryan & Deci, 2000a), our approach suggests that both the appeal and well-being effects of video games are based in their potential to satisfy basic psychological needs for competence, autonomy, and relatedness. We review recent empirical evidence applying this perspective to a number of topics including need satisfaction in games and short-term well-being, the motivational appeal of violent game content, motivational sources of postplay aggression, the antecedents and consequences of disordered patterns of game engagement, and the determinants and effects of immersion. Implications of this model for the future study of game motivation and the use of video games in interventions are discussed. © 2010 American Psychological Association.",doi,10.1037/a0019440,Scopus,Review of General Psychology,"Przybylski A.K., Rigby C.S., Ryan R.M.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,A Multi-Component Social Skills Intervention For Children With Asperger Syndrome: The Junior Detective Training Program,"Background: The study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a new multi-component social skills intervention for children with Asperger syndrome (AS): The Junior Detective Training Program. This 7-week program included a computer game, small group sessions, parent training sessions and teacher handouts. Method: Forty-nine children with AS were recruited to participate and randomly assigned to intervention (n = 26) or wait-list control (n = 23) conditions. Results: Relative to children in the wait-list group, program participants showed greater improvements in social skills over the course of the intervention, as indicated by parent-report measures. Teacher-report data also confirmed that children receiving the intervention made significant improvements in social functioning from pre- to post-treatment. Treatment group participants were better able to suggest appropriate emotion-management strategies for story characters at post-intervention than at pre-intervention, whereas control participants were not. However, there was no difference in the improvements made by children in the intervention and control conditions on facial expression and body-posture recognition measures. Follow-up data suggested that treatment gains were maintained by children at 5-months post-intervention. Conclusions: The Junior Detective Training Program appeared to be effective in enhancing the social skills and emotional understanding of children with AS. Limitations and suggestions for future research are discussed. © 2008 The Authors.",doi,10.1111/j.1469-7610.2008.01920.x,Scopus,Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry and Allied Disciplines,"Beaumont R., Sofronoff K.",2008,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,A New Rfid-Based And Ontological Recreation System For Blind People,"More than five million people are blind in China. Computer game should be attractive to them for leisure time, especially Mahjong. Ontology theory has been adopted to retrieve its knowledge and the low-cost RFID as the mediation between the blind player and computer. We designed an autonomous computer platform called Blind Mahjong Game (BMG), which includes 144 Mahjong tiles and voice prompt function. BMG comprises a plurality of Mahjong cubes (stuck RFID tag) their location in the Mahjong-selection tray or Mahjong-discard tray, a plurality of Chow-Pong-Kong-Win indicator cubes, a win frame, a tile frame, at least one RFID reader connected to BMG by USB port gateway to transmit an RF signal. As compared to current static or drab game for the blind, BMG has been certified by two patents in Taiwan which have shown that its software and hardware integrated novelty, progress and utilisation in the application of RFID technology for the blind.

,A Novel Educational Game For Teaching Emotion Identification Skills To Preschoolers With Autism Diagnosis,"Emotion recognition is essential in human communication and social interaction. Children with autism have been reported to exhibit deficits in understanding and expressing emotions. Those deficits seem to be rather permanent so intervention tools for improving those impairments are desirable. Educational interventions for teaching emotion recognition should occur as early as possible. It is argued that Serious Games can be very effective in the areas of therapy and education for children with autism. However, those computer interventions require considerable skills for interaction. Before the age of 6, most children with autism do not have such basic motor skills in order to manipulate a mouse or a keyboard. Our approach takes account of the specific characteristics of preschoolers with autism and their physical inabilities. By creating an educational computer game, which provides physical interaction with natural user interface (NUI), we aim to support early intervention and to enhance emotion recognition skills.",doi,10.2298/CSIS121212041,Scopus,Computer Science and Information Systems,"Christinaki E., Vidakis N., Triantafyllidis G.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,A Personal Approach: An Empirical Study Of The Process Of Studying My Son’s Problem With Computer Games,"This study explored the process of taking a personal approach to my son’s problems with computer games. As a psychology student, I should have been in a good position to explore the paradoxical emotions and this situation of conflict. Yet I was also aware that relating closely to the people we are studying has long been a taboo even in qualitative research. I nevertheless adopted a collaborative methodology in which I balanced a dual role of parent and researcher. Taking a personal approach, allowing intimate, reciprocal negotiation, I was not only able to put this taboo to the rare empirical test but also achieved an insight that would otherwise have not been available to me. By engaging in dialogue and encouraging the ability to object, a first-person plural (We), position was achieved in which an understanding of this situation developed and has transferred to our everyday lives. © The Author(s) 2015.",doi,10.1177/1609406915618048,Scopus,International Journal of Qualitative Methods,"Weir K., Costall A.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,"A Pilot Study Evaluating ""Dojo,"" A Videogame Intervention For Youths With Externalizing And Anxiety Problems","Objective: Externalizing problems, which are the main reason for youth referrals to mental health agencies, are highly persistent and predict a range of negative outcomes. Youths with externalizing problems are also frequently comorbid with anxiety. Among the most widely recognized evidence-based treatments is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Although CBT principles seem to be sound, effect sizes remain moderate, suggesting improvements could be made to this conventional treatment approach. The main premise of the current pilot study is to investigate the feasibility of implementing a videogame intervention (""Dojo"" [Gamedesk, Los Angeles, CA]) that incorporates CBT principles and aims to address the limitations of conventional CBT delivery models, with the ultimate goal of improving outcomes for this difficult-to-treat population. Materials and Methods: ""Dojo"" is an emotion management game that helps youths to recognize and control their physiological and emotional arousal. We explored the implementation and user experience of ""Dojo"" in a sample of eight adolescents in residential treatment for both externalizing and anxiety problems. Results: Participants attended all sessions without complaints. They evaluated ""Dojo"" very positively and exhibited high compliance during the training sessions. We encountered some problems with session scheduling and obtaining mentor reports. Quantitative data show the predicted decrease in three out of four measurements. Conclusions: The smooth implementation, high user satisfaction, high self-reported compliance during training sessions, and initial outcome results all indicate the high potential ""Dojo"" holds as an innovative intervention. If additional rigorously designed randomized controlled trials prove to be successful, ""Dojo"" can be a cost-effective way to engage high-risk youths in effective intervention. © Copyright 2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2015.",doi,10.1089/g4h.2014.0138,Scopus,Games for Health Journal,"Schuurmans A.A.T., Nijhof K.S., Vermaes I.P.R., Engels R.C.M.E., Granic I.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,A Study In Users' Physiological Response To An Empathic Interface Agent,"This paper presents a novel method for evaluating the impact of animated interface agents with affective and empathic behavior. While previous studies relied on questionnaires in order to assess the user's overall experience with the interface agent, we will analyze users' physiological response (skin conductance and electromyography), which allows us to estimate affect-related user experiences on a moment-by-moment basis without interfering with the primary interaction task. As an interaction scenario, a card game has been implemented where the user plays against a virtual opponent. The findings of our study indicate that within a competitive gaming scenario, (i) the absence of the agent's display of negative emotions is conceived as arousing or stress-inducing, and (ii) the valence of users' emotional response is congruent with the valence of the emotion expressed by the agent. Our results for skin conductance could also be reproduced by assuming a local rather than a global baseline. © 2006 World Scientific Publishing Company.",doi,10.1142/S0219843606000801,Scopus,International Journal of Humanoid Robotics,"Prendinger H., Becker C., Ishizuka M.",2006,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,A Training Simulation System With Realistic Autonomous Ship Control,"In this article we present a computational approach to developing effective training systems for virtual simulation environments. In particular, we focus on a Naval simulation system, used for training of conning officers. The currently existing training solutions require multiple expert personnel to control each vessel in a training scenario, or are cumbersome to use by a single instructor. The inability of current technology to provide an automated mechanism for competitive realistic boat behaviors thus compromises the goal of flexible, anytime, anywhere training. In this article we propose an approach that reduces the time and effort required for training of conning officers, by integrating novel approaches to autonomous control within a simulation environment. Our solution is to develop intelligent, autonomous controllers that drive the behavior of each boat. To increase the system's efficiency we provide a mechanism for creating such controllers, from the demonstration of a navigation expert, using a simple programming interface. In addition, our approach deals with two significant and related challenges: the realism of behavior exhibited by the automated boats and their real-time response to changes in the environment. In this article, we describe the control architecture we developed that enables the real-time response of boats and the repertoire of realistic behaviors we designed for this application. We also present our approach for facilitating the automatic authoring of training scenarios and we demonstrate the capabilities of our system with experimental results. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing, Inc.",doi,10.1111/j.1467-8640.2007.00318.x,Scopus,Computational Intelligence,"Nicolescu M., Leigh R., Olenderski A., Louis S., Dascalu S., Miles C., Quiroz J., Aleson R.",2007,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,A Very Fast Simulated Re-Annealing (Vfsa) Approach For Land Data Assimilation,"We develop a new data assimilation algorithm by employing a heuristic optimization approach named very fast simulated re-annealing (VFSA), which is capable of minimizing the cost function without using the adjoint model. The method is independent on model operator and observation operator, and has advantages in dealing with strong nonlinearities and discontinuities. Based on the VFSA algorithm, we design a land data assimilation scheme which can assimilate both the in situ measurement of soil moisture, and the passive microwave remote sensing observations into a land surface model. The scheme is tested with GAME-Tibet observations and TMI brightness temperature. Results show that it works successfully with strongly nonlinear land surface model, SiB2 and the radiative transfer model of moist soil. The cost value calculated from optimized initial state is much smaller and the bias from observations are also significantly reduced. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

,Acoustic Emissions From Active Cooling Solutions For Portable Devices,"Due to ever increasing consumer demand, today's marketplace is full of portable computing devices such as notebook computers, gaming machines, personal digital assistants, and smart phones. In each of these technologies, processing power and functionality levels are continuing to increase, resulting in increased thermal management issues. The former of these technologies already use an active cooling solution with a profile of 1015 mm while the latter two are quickly approaching the limits of passive cooling. Since a common characteristic in each of these technologies is the desire to reduce profile height, there exists a need to develop low profile cooling solutions that are capable of supporting this growing market. However, a prerequisite to developing such solutions is an accurate understanding of how the noise level characteristics of the driving fans scale with height. This paper experimentally addresses the acoustic scaling of low profile fans. The rotor heights range from 0.5 mm to 15 mm with diameters from 15 mm to 32 mm, giving an aspect ratio of height relative to diameter of 0.030.6. The results can be used as a foundation for the development of active cooling in mobile devices where both correlations for noise levels and basic design criteria are identified. © 2009 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TCAPT.2009.2027605,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Components and Packaging Technologies,"Walsh E., Walsh P., Punch J., Grimes R.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Active Video Games As An Exercise Tool For Children With Cystic Fibrosis,"Background: Active video games are used in many hospitals as exercise tools for children with cystic fibrosis. However, the exercise intensity associated with playing these games has not been examined in this population. Methods: Children with cystic fibrosis [n=30, aged 12.3 (2.6) years, 17 boys, BMI 17.7 (2.8) kg/m2] were recruited from outpatient clinics in Dublin hospitals. Age and gender matched control children were recruited from local schools. Oxygen consumption, metabolic equivalents (METs) calculated from resting V̇O2, and heart rate were measured while playing Nintendo Wii™ (Nintendo Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) Sports Boxing and Nintendo Wii Fit Free Jogging using a portable indirect calorimeter (Oxycon Mobile). Results: Playing Wii Boxing resulted in light intensity activity (2.46. METs) while playing Wii Fit Free Jogging resulted in moderate intensity physical activity (4.44. METs). No significant difference was seen between groups in the energy cost of playing active video games. Conclusion: Active video games are a useful source of light to moderate intensity physical activity in children with cystic fibrosis. © 2013 European Cystic Fibrosis Society.",doi,10.1016/j.jcf.2013.10.008,Scopus,Journal of Cystic Fibrosis,"O'Donovan C., Greally P., Canny G., McNally P., Hussey J.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Acute Cognitively Engaging Exergame-Based Physical Activity Enhances Executive Functions In Adolescents,"The study aimed to elucidate the influence of cognitive engagement comprised in an acute bout of exergame-based physical activity on executive functions (inhibition, cognitive flexibility) in adolescents. Therefore, the level of cognitive engagement and the intensity of physical activity were systematically varied across three experimental conditions. Sixty-five healthy male adolescents (13-16 years) were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (a) physical activity with high levels of cognitive engagement during active video gaming, (b) physical activity with low levels of cognitive engagement during active video gaming, (c) sedentary with low levels of cognitive engagement during passive video watching. Manipulation checks, including subjective and objective operationalizations of cognitive engagement, were applied. Executive functions were assessed before and after each condition using the D-KEFS design fluency test. Results showed that cognitive engagement, operationalized by subjects' ratings and heart rate variability, differed between conditions. The physical activity condition with a high level of cognitive engagement resulted in significantly better performance in cognitive flexibility compared to conditions with low levels of cognitive engagement. Regarding benefits for executive functions in male adolescents, the results indicate that acute physical activity with high cognitive engagement could be more efficient than physical activity of the same intensity with low cognitive engagement. Even though further evidence is needed, these results extend previous research and suggest a methodological approach for measuring cognitive engagement. © 2016 Benzing et al.

,Acute Effects Of Violent Video-Game Playing On Blood Pressure And Appetite Perception In Normal-Weight Young Men: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"Watching television and playing video game being seated represent sedentary behaviours and increase the risk of weight gain and hypertension. We investigated the acute effects of violent and non-violent video-game playing on blood pressure (BP), appetite perception and food preferences. Forty-eight young, normal-weight men (age: 23.1±1.9 years; body mass index: 22.5±1.9 kg/m 2) participated in a three-arm, randomized trial. Subjects played a violent video game, a competitive, non-violent video game or watched TV for 1 h. Measurements of BP, stress and appetite perception were recorded before a standardized meal (∼300 kcal) and then repeated every 15 min throughout the intervention. Violent video-game playing was associated with a significant increase in diastolic BP (Δ±s.d.=+7.5±5.8 mm Hg; P=0.04) compared with the other two groups. Subjects playing violent video games felt less full (P=0.02) and reported a tendency towards sweet food consumption. Video games involving violence appear to be associated with significant effects on BP and appetite perceptions compared with non-violent gaming or watching TV. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",doi,10.1038/ejcn.2013.180,Scopus,European Journal of Clinical Nutrition,"Siervo M., Sabatini S., Fewtrell M.S., Wells J.C.K.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Acute Nk1 Receptor Antagonist Administration Affects Reward Incentive Anticipation Processing In Healthy Volunteers,"The primary brain structures of reward processing are mainly situated in the mid-brain dopamine system. The nucleus accumbens (NAc) receives dopaminergic projections from the ventral tegmental area and works as a key brain region for the positive incentive value of rewards. Because neurokinin-1 (NK1) receptor, the cognate receptor for substance P (SP), is highly expressed in the NAc, we hypothesized that the SP/NK1 receptor system might play a role in positive reward processing in the NAc in humans. Therefore, we conducted a functional MRI (fMRI) study to assess the effects of an NK1 receptor antagonist on human reward processing through a monetary incentive delay task that is known to elicit robust activation in the NAc especially during gain anticipation. Eighteen healthy adults participated in two series of an fMRI study, taking either a placebo or the NK1 receptor antagonist aprepitant. Behavioural measurements revealed that there was no significant difference in reaction time, hit rate, or self-reported effort for incentive cues between the placebo and aprepitant treatments. fMRI showed significant decrease in blood oxygenation-level-dependent signals in the NAc during gain anticipation with the aprepitant treatment compared to the placebo treatment. These results suggest that SP/NK1 receptor system is involved in processing of positive incentive anticipation and plays a role in accentuating positive valence in association with the primary dopaminergic pathways in the reward circuit. © CINP 2013.",doi,10.1017/S1461145712001678,Scopus,International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology,"Saji K., Ikeda Y., Kim W., Shingai Y., Tateno A., Takahashi H., Okubo Y., Fukayama H., Suzuki H.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Acute Stress Increases Sex Differences In Risk Seeking In The Balloon Analogue Risk Task,"Background: Decisions involving risk often must be made under stressful circumstances. Research on behavioral and brain differences in stress responses suggest that stress might have different effects on risk taking in males and females. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study, participants played a computer game designed to measure risk taking (the Balloon Analogue Risk Task) fifteen minutes after completing a stress challenge or control task. Stress increased risk taking among men but decreased it among women. Conclusions/Significance: Acute stress amplifies sex differences in risk seeking; making women more risk avoidant and men more risk seeking. Evolutionary principles may explain these stress-induced sex differences in risk taking behavior. © 2009 Lighthall et al.",doi,10.1371/journal.pone.0006002,Scopus,PLoS ONE,"Lighthall N.R., Mather M., Gorlick M.A.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia

Psychological Bulletin, 130(3), 355–391.","This meta-analysis reviews 208 laboratory studies of acute psychological stressors and tests a theoretical model delineating conditions capable of eliciting cortisol responses. Psychological stressors increased cortisol levels; however, effects varied widely across tasks. Consistent with the theoretical model, motivated performance tasks elicited cortisol responses if they were uncontrollable or characterized by social-evaluative threat (task performance could be negatively judged by others), when methodological factors and other stressor characteristics were controlled for. Tasks containing both uncontrollable and social-evaluative elements were associated with the largest cortisol and adrenocorticotropin hormone changes and the longest times to recovery. These findings are consistent with the animal literature on the physiological effects of uncontrollable social threat and contradict the belief that cortisol is responsive to all types of stressors.

,Adaptive Tele-Therapies Based On Serious Games For Health For People With Time-Management And Organisational Problems: Preliminary Results,"Attention Deficit with Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is one of the most prevalent disorders within the child population today. Inattention problems can lead to greater difficulties in completing assignments, as well as problems with time management and prioritisation of tasks. This article presents an intelligent tele-therapy tool based on Serious Games for Health, aimed at the improvement of time management skills and the prioritisation of tasks. This tele-system is based on the use of decision trees within Django, a high-level Python Web framework. The technologies and techniques used were selected so as to boost user involvement and to enable the system to be easily customised. This article shows the preliminary results of the pilot-phase in an experiment performed to evaluate the use of adaptive tele-therapies within a group of typically developing children and adolescents aged between 12 and 19 years old without ADHD. To do so, we relied on the collection of parameters and the conduct of surveys for assessing time management skills, as well as measuring system usability and availability. The results of a time management survey highlighted that the users involved in the trial did not use any specific or effective time management techniques, scoring 1.98 and 2.30 out of 5 points in this area for ages under 15 and over 16 years old, respectively. The final calculations based on the usability questionnaire resulted in an average score of 78.75 out of 100. The creation of a customisable tool capable of working with different skills, in conjunction with the replication of the current study, may help to understand these users' needs, as well as boosting time management skills among teenagers with and without ADHD. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",doi,10.3390/ijerph110100749,Scopus,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"Frutos-Pascual M., Zapirain B.G., Zorrilla A.M.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Adolescent Girls' Energy Expenditure During Dance Simulation Active Computer Gaming,"Abstract The objective of this study was to determine the energy expended and intensity of physical activity achieved by adolescent girls while playing on a dance simulation game. Twenty adolescent girls were recruited from a local secondary school. Resting oxygen uptake V̇O2 and heart rate were analysed while sitting quietly and subsequently during ~30 min of game play, with 10 min at each of three increasing levels of difficulty. Energy expenditure was predicted from V̇O2 at rest and during game play at three levels of play, from which the metabolic equivalents (METS) of game playing were derived. Mean ± standard deviation energy expenditure for levels 1, 2, and 3 was 3.63 ± 0.58, 3.65 ± 0.54, and 4.14 ± 0.71 kcal min-1 respectively, while mean activity for each level of play was at least of moderate intensity (&gt; 3 METS). Dance simulation active computer games provide an opportunity for most adolescent girls to exercise at moderate intensity. Therefore, regular playing might contribute to daily physical activity recommendations for good health in this at-risk population. © 2010 Taylor &amp; Francis.",doi,10.1080/02640410903369935,Scopus,Journal of Sports Sciences,"Fawkner S.G., Niven A., Thin A.G., MacDonald M.J., Oakes J.R.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Affective Level Design For A Role-Playing Videogame Evaluated By A Brain–Computer Interface And Machine Learning Methods,"Game science has become a research field, which attracts industry attention due to a worldwide rich sell-market. To understand the player experience, concepts like flow or boredom mental states require formalization and empirical investigation, taking advantage of the objective data that psychophysiological methods like electroencephalography (EEG) can provide. This work studies the affective ludology and shows two different game levels for Neverwinter Nights 2 developed with the aim to manipulate emotions; two sets of affective design guidelines are presented, with a rigorous formalization that considers the characteristics of role-playing genre and its specific gameplay. An empirical investigation with a brain–computer interface headset has been conducted: by extracting numerical data features, machine learning techniques classify the different activities of the gaming sessions (task and events) to verify if their design differentiation coincides with the affective one. The observed results, also supported by subjective questionnaires data, confirm the goodness of the proposed guidelines, suggesting that this evaluation methodology could be extended to other evaluation tasks. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",doi,10.1007/s00371-016-1320-2,Scopus,Visual Computer,"Balducci F., Grana C., Cucchiara R.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Affective Moderators Of The Cardiovascular Response To Stress In Offspring Of Hypertensives,"The present study examined the influence of trait anxiety on the cardiovascular responses of normotensive offspring of hypertensives and normotensives. Forty-eight young adult males, half of whom were offspring of hypertensives (PH+), were exposed to an extended active coping stressor. This was a 1 hr shock avoidance procedure with avoidance made contingent on video-game performance. Trait anxiety status interacted with parental history of hypertension in predicting cardiovascular response. PH+ subjects who scored high on trait anxiety exhibited greater elevations of heart rate and forearm blood flow, and decreases in forearm vascular resistance than did PH+/low trait anxiety subjects or offspring of normotensives (PH-). Cardiovascular responses of PH+/low trait anxiety subjects did not differ significantly from those of PH- subjects. Results suggest affective factors may moderate cardiovascular responses of individuals at risk for hypertension. © 1992.",doi,10.1016/0022-3999(92)90023-U,Scopus,Journal of Psychosomatic Research,Miller S.B.,1992,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Aggression And Psychopathology In Adolescents With A Preference For Violent Electronic Games,"Associations between a preference for violent electronic games and adolescents' self-perceptions of problem behaviors and emotions were examined. It was predicted that a preference for violent games would be associated with negative externalizing characteristics, in particular aggressive emotions and behaviors, on the Youth Self-Report (YSR), a standardized self-report measure of adolescent problem behaviors. Thirty-two 11- through 15-year-olds (17 girls) listed and categorized favorite electronic games into one of six predetermined categories and completed the YSR. MANOVA revealed significant relationships between a preference for violent games and the Thought Problems subscale (P < .01) and YSR Total Score (P < .05), with trends noted for the Internalizing (P < .06) and Anxious-Depressed (P < .08) subscales. Expected relationships with externalizing behaviors, including aggression, were not found. However, across all YSR subscales, children with higher preference for violent games had more clinically significant elevations than those with low preference for violent games. On the Total Problems subscale, of the eight children receiving scores in the clinically significant range, six were in the High preference group (three boys and three girls). The failure to find the expected relationships between a preference for violent games and aggressive, externalizing behaviors is puzzling. It is possible that individuals with a preference for violent games may have high exposure to all forms of media violence. Their perceptions of their own behavior, in comparison, may not seem sufficiently aggressive to justify endorsement of problems in this area. Or, playing violent electronic games may promote a disconnection between the emotions normally associated with violence and violent acts. These explanations are consistent with a desensitization model where exposure to media violence decreases sensitivity to aggression. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",doi,10.1002/ab.90015,Scopus,Aggressive Behavior,"Funk J.B., Hagan J., Schimming J., Bullock W.A., Buchman D.D., Myers M.",2002,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Aggressive And Non-Violent Videogames: Short-Term Psychological And Cardiovascular Effects On Habitual Players,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the short-term effects on several physiological (arterial pressure and heart rate) and psychological (anxiety and aggressiveness) indexes of playing violent and non-violent videogames in young adults. The study was carried out on a sample of 22 male participants. Subjects invited to participate in the study were recruited from a videogame leisure club. Before and during playing either a violent or non-violent computer game, blood pressure and heart rate were measured. Before and after the game session, the subjects completed the State-Anxiety Inventory-Y (STAI-Y) and the Buss-Durkee Hostility Inventory. The results of the study showed a range of short-term effects of playing violent and non-violent videogames on arterial pressure and on the state anxiety of subjects, but not on hostility measurements. More specifically, the group that played the violent videogames showed a significant increase in the state anxiety score at the end of the game, as compared to the pre-game self-evaluation, and an increase in the systolic blood pressure while the subjects were playing as compared to pre- and post-game values. A decrease in diastolic blood pressure after playing any game was also found.

,Alternative Options For Prescribing Physical Activity Among Obese Children And Adolescents: Brisk Walking Supported By An Exergaming Platform [Opciones Alternativas Para Prescribir Actividad Física Entre Niños Y Adolescentes Obesos: Marcha Rápida Con El Apoyo De Videojuegos Activos],"Background: Physical inactivity has been identified as an important public health concern for children. An increasing sedentary way of life is directly related to obesity; hence, prevention and management of childhood obesity are commonly based on lifestyle interventions wherein increasing physical activity is one of the main targets. The use of exergames can be useful in promoting physical activity, but it is necessary more research. This study analyzes the effects of an exergaming platform that involves brisk walking, on perceived exertion, self-efficacy, positive expectations and satisfaction in a sample of clinically obese children, as compared with normal weight children. Physiological variables like heart rate, oxygen consumption and energy expenditure were also measured. Method: A total sample of 42 children was recruited. Children were randomized into those walking on a treadmill and those using a treadmill with the support of the exergaming platform (Wii-Fit). Results: The obese children scored significantly higher in expectations and satisfaction in the exergame condition but not in self-efficacy, perceived exertion or physiological measures. Conclusions: These results suggest that this exergaming platform could be a tool to assist obese children in the practice of brisk walking as part of a programme designed to treat obesity. © 2015, Grupo Aula Medica S.A.

,An Agent-Based Modelling Approach To Build Up Educational Digital Games For Kindergarten And Primary Schools,"Most of the educational materials, such as the exercises contained in activity books or the Montessori-like games that are commonly used in kindergartens and primary schools share a common deep structure and have similar features. Capturing these commonalities in an explanatory model leads to a general framework that may be useful to develop games engine, in particular, digital games for children that enhance the learning and teaching experiences. In this paper, we analyze the structure of above mentioned educational materials and propose to describe it in terms of interacting agents' model. Moreover, we present Block Magic and SNIFF, first two examples of educational Montessori-like games to better explain how this general framework can be employed in educational game development.

,An Analysis Of Physiological Signals As A Measure Of Task Engagement In A Multi-Limb-Coordination Motor-Learning Task.,"There is widespread agreement in the physical rehabilitation community that task engagement is essential to effective neuromuscular recovery. Despite this, there are no clear measures of such task engagement. This paper assesses the extent to which certain physiological measurements might provide a measure of task engagement. In previous studies, correlations between mental focus and certain physiological measurements have been observed in subjects performing tasks requiring mental effort. In this study, the authors analyzed whether these signals showed similar correlation when subjects performed a multi-limb-coordination motor-learning task. Subjects played a video game which required the use of both arms and one leg to play a simplified electronic drum set with varying difficulty. Heart rate (HR), skin conductance level (SCL), and facial electromyogram (EMG) were recorded while the subjects played. Analysis of the recordings showed statistically significant correlations relating task difficulty to SCL, HR and EMG amplitude in corrugator supercilii. No statistically significant correlation was observed between task difficulty and EMG in frontalis.",doi,10.1109/EMBC.2015.7318803,pubmed,Conference proceedings : ...

,An Assessment Of Emotional Reactivity To Frustration Of Goal Pursuit In Euthymic Bipolar I Disorder,"Affective disturbance is a central feature of bipolar disorder. Many investigators have hypothesized that euthymic people with bipolar disorder might display elevated emotional reactivity, but laboratory studies of emotional reactivity have had mixed results. Drawing on theories of bipolar disorder that emphasize dysregulation of goal pursuit, we hypothesized that people with bipolar disorder might be emotionally hyperreactive to frustration of goal pursuit. Forty-seven euthymic participants with bipolar disorder and 43 control participants played a computer game for a monetary reward. To induce frustration, we programmed the game to respond inconsistently to user input during two periods. The frustration induction was successful as measured by self-report, physiological responding, and facial behavior, but contrary to the hypothesis of emotional hyperreactivity in bipolar disorder, the bipolar and control groups were equally reactive to frustration. Future studies will benefit from more specific hypotheses about how emotion might be altered in bipolar disorder. © The Author(s) 2014.",doi,10.1177/2167702614555412,Scopus,Clinical Psychological Science,"Edge M.D., Lwi S.J., Johnson S.L.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia

,An Innovative Cycling Exergame To Promote Cardiovascular Fitness In Youth With Cerebral Palsy,"Objective: To evaluate the effects of an internet-platform exergame cycling programme on cardiovascular fitness of youth with cerebral palsy (CP). Methods: In this pilot prospective case series, eight youth with bilateral spastic CP, Gross Motor Functional Classification System (GMFCS) level III, completed a six-week exergame programme. Outcomes were obtained at baseline and post-intervention. The primary outcome measure was the GMFCS III-specific shuttle run test (SRT-III). Secondary outcomes included health-related quality of life (HQL) as measured by the KIDSCREEN-52 questionnaire, six-minute walk test, Wingate arm cranking test and anthropomorphic measurements. Results: There were significant improvements in the SRT-III (t=−2.5, p=0.04, d=0.88) post-intervention. There were no significant changes in secondary outcomes. Conclusion: An exergame cycling programme may lead to improvement in cardiovascular fitness in youth with CP. This study was limited by small sample size and lack of a comparison group.

,Analysis And Improvement Of Runoff Generation In The Land Surface Scheme Class And Comparison With Field Measurements From China,"The Canadian Land Surface Scheme (CLASS) is evaluated comprehensively using both site-specific data and observed hydrograph from the monsoon region of China. Two versions of CLASS, with and without hydrological modification allowing for interflow and baseflow, are used in this study. We modify standard CLASS for interflow generation using a field capacity threshold together with a spatial probability distribution function to represent sub-grid variability in soil field capacity. We also introduce a linear reservoir at the bottom of the third CLASS soil layer to model the baseflow. The 1998-99 HUBEX/GAME (HUaihe river Basin EXperiment/Monsoon Asian GEWEX Experiment) IOP (Intensive Observation Period) data set is used in this study. CLASS is driven by observed atmospheric forcing in a stand-alone mode. Both standard and modified versions of CLASS are first evaluated using the observed hydrograph at the outlet of the Shiguanhe sub-basin, part of the Huaihe River Basin in China, and soil moisture measurements at three sites over the sub-basin. The two versions are further validated for their ability to simulate net radiation, sensible and latent heat fluxes, ground heat flux, and soil temperature and moisture over four measurement sites with different land covers in the Huaihe River Basin. The total runoff in the Shiguanhe sub-basin simulated by the two versions is similar to each other, and is in close agreement with the observed value. The main difference between the two versions is in the partitioning of runoff components among the surface runoff, interflow and baseflow. Modified CLASS simulates better both peak flows and flood timing. The two versions of CLASS give similar results for the net radiation, sensible and latent heat fluxes, ground heat flux, and soil temperature and moisture, which compare well with observations over the study sites. Our modification of standard CLASS thus leads to an improvement in runoff and hydrograph simulation, while preserving its existing positive features. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

,Anger Mediates The Effect Of Ostracism On Risk-Taking,"The present research tested the effects of being ostracized on risk-taking behavior and how emotional responses to ostracism mediate these effects. In two experiments, undergraduates were either ostracized or included during an Internet ball-toss game (Cyberball). In Experiment 1 (N = 52), ostracism increased self-reported risk-taking inclinations, and the relation between ostracism and risk-taking was mediated by feelings of anger, but not control. In Experiment 2 (N = 72), ostracism increased risky driving during a driving video game. The effect of ostracism on risk-taking was again mediated by post-ostracism anger (but not control or ostracism-induced sadness). This research suggests that anger elicited by ostracism may increase risk-taking. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",doi,10.1080/13669877.2014.1003320,Scopus,Journal of Risk Research,"Svetieva E., Zadro L., Denson T.F., Dale E., O’Moore K., Zheng W.Y.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Anger Suppression And Adiposity Modulate Association Between Adrb2 Haplotype And Cardiovascular Stress Reactivity,"Objectives: The purpose of this study was to examine how variation in the beta-2 adrenergic receptor gene (ADRB2), in combination with the moderating influences of race, body mass index (BMI), and anger expression style (anger-in, anger-out), affects blood pressure (BP) at rest and in response to acute laboratory stress. Methods: Four hundred fifty adolescents (mean age = 18.5 ± 2.7 years; 228 [124 males] whites and 222 [110 males] blacks completed two stressors (video game challenge, forehead cold pressor). Hemodynamic measures were taken before, during, and after each stressor. Stressors were separated by a 20-minute rest period. Results: Frequency of detrimental haplotype (Gly16/Glu27) carrier status was greater among whites than blacks (p < .05). A significant three-way interaction among haplotype, BMI, and race for resting systolic blood pressure (SBP) found the highest BP level to be among high BMI carriers, but only for whites. A separate three-way interaction was found to be significant for haplotype, anger-in and race such that high anger-in carriers showed the highest level of resting SBP (p < .05) and total peripheral resistance (TPR) (p < .05) and the greatest TPR reactivity to the cold pressor task (p < .01). Post hoc analyses revealed these interactions with anger-in were only present among blacks. No significant interactions with anger-out for either ethnic group were observed. Conclusions: This study demonstrates modulating influences of BMI and anger expression styles on ADRB2 gene associations with hemodynamic function at rest and in response to laboratory stress. These findings support the hypothesis that consideration of gene-environment interactions may better characterize the role of ADRB2 variation in the development of stress-induced essential hypertension.

,Anterior Insula Activity Reflects The Effects Of Intentionality On The Anticipation Of Aversive Stimulation,"If someone causes you harm, your affective reaction to that person might be profoundly influenced by your inferences about the intentionality of their actions. In the present study, we aimed to understand how affective responses to a biologically salient aversive outcome administered by others are modulated by the extent to which a given individual is judged to have deliberately or inadvertently delivered the outcome. Using fMRI, we examined how neural responses to anticipation and receipt of an aversive stimulus are modulated by this fundamental social judgment. We found that affective evaluations about an individual whose actions led to either noxious or neutral consequences for the subject did indeed depend on the perceived intentions of that individual. At the neural level, activity in the anterior insula correlated with the interaction between perceived intentionality and anticipated outcome valence, suggesting that this region reflects the influence of mental state attribution on aversive expectations. © 2014 the authors.",doi,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1126-14.2014,Scopus,Journal of Neuroscience,"Liljeholm M., Dunne S., O'Doherty J.P.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Appetitive And Defensive Arousal In Violent Video Games: Explaining Individual Differences In Attraction To And Effects Of Video Games,"Evidence surrounding the attraction to media violence is mixed and the effects of violent video game play on players varies across experimental participants. Differences in both may be explained by differences in experienced positive or negative arousal. This study utilizes the limited capacity model of motivated mediated message processing (LC4MP) and the motivation activation measure (MAM), which measures resting activation of the appetitive and aversive arousal systems, to explore the relationship between attraction to media violence, arousal, and aggression. In part 1, a questionnaire found that men and frequent players of violent games expected to enjoy violent games more than nonviolent games. In addition, participants whose scores on the MAM characterized them as risk takers (high scores on appetitive arousal and low scores on aversive arousal) indicated a stronger preference for violent games compared to the other three arousal types, which is in line with the LC4MP. In the experimental portion of the research, after playing a violent game, those participants characterized as risk avoidant (high on aversive arousal and low on appetitive arousal) were significantly less aggressive than all other arousal groups. Overall, results show that individual differences in the appetitive and aversive arousal systems can explain attraction to violent media. Furthermore, arousal resulting from violent video game play can be experienced as pleasant or aversive, and it is this experience of arousal that explains variations in aggressive responses to violent video games. © Taylor & Francis.",doi,10.1080/15213269.2014.888007,Scopus,Media Psychology,"Krcmar M., Farrar K.M., Jalette G., McGloin R.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Are Cardiovascular Responses To Behavioral Stressors A Stable Individual Difference Variable In Childhood?,"The present paper reports two studies which address the extent to which cardiovascular responses to behavioral stress can be conceptualised as a stable individual difference variable in children. In the first study, eighth grade girls (mean age = 14.2 yrs) who had participated in a study of the familial aggregation of cardiovascular responses to behavioral stress were asked to repeat the assessment protocol when they were in (he ninth grade (mean age = 15.1 yrs). Results showed that mean task‐induced increases in diastolic blood pressure and heart rate during serial subtraction, mirror image tracing, and isometric handgrip tasks were reliable across test sessions, particularly due to the reliable increases exhibited during the mirror image tracing task. In the second study, fifth grade boys (mean age = 10.4 yrs) who had participated in a previous experiment (Matthews & Jennings, 1984) of cardiovascular responses during a video game were tested in the ninth grade (mean age ‐ 14.0 yrs) in the protocol used in Study 1. Results showed that mean tusk‐induced increases in diastolic blood pressure and heart rate during video games were related to mean task‐induced increases during serial subtraction, mirror image tracing, and isometric handgrip tasks over three years Liter. The association for heart rate increases during the video game and isometric handgrip task was particularly impressive. These results suggest that task‐induced diastolic blood pressure and heart rate responses of children are stable over substantial periods of time and amiss important developmental transitions, and generalize across tasks requiring qualitatively different behavioral responses. Nonetheless, future research is needed in adults and children to further identify factors which influence the stability and generalizability of cardiovascular responses to behavioral stress.

,"Are Hospital Workers Healthy?: A Study Of Cardiometabolic, Behavioral, And Psychosocial Factors Associatedwith Obesity Among Hospital Workers","Objective: This study evaluated the cardiometabolic, behavioral, and psychosocial factors associated with weight status among hospital employees. Methods: A total of n=924 employees across the six hospitals in Texas participated in this cross-sectional study, 2012 to 2013. Association between weight status and waist circumference, blood pressure, biomarkers, diet, physical activity, sedentary behaviors, and psychosocial factors was assessed. Results: About 78.1% of employees were overweight/obese. Obese participants (body mass index [BMI] ≥30.0 kg/m2) had higher consumption of potatoes, fats, sugary beverages, and spent more time watching television, playing computer games, and sitting than those having normal weight. Being obese was positively associated with blood pressure, blood glucose, low-density lipoprotein, and negatively associated with highdensity lipoprotein. Finally, 78.8% of workers were dissatisfied with their worksite wellness with dissatisfaction being higher among obese employees. Being overweight (BMI 25.0 to 29.9 kg/m2) was positively associated with blood pressure, but not other variables. Conclusion: Understanding the risk profile of hospital workers is critical to developing effective interventions.

,Arterial Pulse Transit Time And Ecg-Initiated Transit Time: The Form Of The Conditioned Responses,"Arterial pulse transit time (PTT), ECG-initiated transit time (ECG-TT), and interbeat interval were recorded during a differential classical conditioning procedure with a commercial video game functioning as the unconditioned stimulus. In Experiment 1, subjects were presented with 20 acquisition trials. Both PTT and ECG-TT showed differential changes to the CS+ and CS-. The PTT CR took the form of a decrease in transit time, reaching maximum between 5 and 7 beats after CS onset, and the ECG-TT response was biphasic, consisting of an initial lengthening from baseline during the first three beats after CS onset followed by a decrease below baseline, reaching maximum at Beats 8–10. Experiment 2 is a replication of Experiment 1 using 40 acquisition trials. PTT and ECG-TT CRs were similar to those observed in Experiment 1 and persisted during the 40 trials. The PTT decrease from baseline during Beats 5–7 was significant, as were the deceleratory and acceleratory ECG-TT components. © 1984, Psychonomic Society, Inc..

,Ascending Aortic Tear With Severe Aortic Regurgitation Following Rugby Injury,Blunt ascending aortic injuries are rare in clinical practice. Aortic valve regurgitation is an uncommon consequence of closed chest injury. It is caused by either ruptured valve cusp or when subadventitial rupture of the ascending aorta causes prolapse of subjacent valve cusp. Most of the blunt aortic injuries are secondary to high speed motor vehicle accident or falls from significant height. We report on a 33-year-old man who sustained an injury during a rugby game and presented with severe aortic regurgitation secondary to subadventitial rupture of ascending aorta on a background of asymptomatic dilated aortic root.

,"Attitude Generalization: Similarity, Valence, And Extremity","Attitude generalization was explored as a function of object similarity and attitude valence and extremity. Participants in a computer game formed attitudes toward positive and negative, mild or extreme stimuli. How well these attitudes generalized to similar, novel stimuli was then examined. Visual similarity to game targets affected categorization of novel stimuli, such that greater resemblance resulted in more similar classification. However, generalization varied by valence and extremity. Negative attitudes generalized more than positive attitudes, requiring less resemblance for a novel target to be classified as negative. This pattern was more obvious with extreme attitudes than mild attitudes. That is, extreme attitudes were more influential and given more weight than mild attitudes. Also, specific conditions were identified under which positive attitudes proved more influential than negative attitudes. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

,Automatic Recognition Of Non-Acted Affective Postures,"The conveyance and recognition of affect and emotion partially determine how people interact with others and how they carry out and perform in their day-to-day activities. Hence, it is becoming necessary to endow technology with the ability to recognize users' affective states to increase the technologies' effectiveness. This paper makes three contributions to this research area. First, we demonstrate recognition models that automatically recognize affective states and affective dimensions from non-acted body postures instead of acted postures. The scenario selected for the training and testing of the automatic recognition models is a body-movement-based video game. Second, when attributing affective labels and dimension levels to the postures represented as faceless avatars, the level of agreement for observers was above chance level. Finally, with the use of the labels and affective dimension levels assigned by the observers as ground truth and the observers' level of agreement as base rate, automatic recognition models grounded on low-level posture descriptions were built and tested for their ability to generalize to new observers and postures using random repeated subsampling validation. The automatic recognition models achieve recognition percentages comparable to the human base rates as hypothesized. © 2011 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TSMCB.2010.2103557,Scopus,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B: Cybernetics","Kleinsmith A., Bianchi-Berthouze N., Steed A.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Autonomic Characteristics Of Defensive Hostility: Reactivity And Recovery To Active And Passive Stressors,"The autonomic characteristics of hostility and defensiveness were assessed in 55 male undergraduates based on composite Cook Medley Hostility (Chost) and Marlowe Crowne Social Desirability (MC) scores to create 4 groups: Defensive Hostile (DH; high MC, high Chost), High Hostile (HH; low MC, high Chost), Defensive (Def; high MC, low Chost) and Low Hostile (LH; low MC, low Chost). All subjects engaged in a video game (VG) and hand cold pressor (CP) task. Cardiovascular responses in DH subjects were predicted to show enhanced sympathetic α and β-adrenergic activity and the least vagal control compared to others across tasks. DH and LH men showed significant heart rate reactivity to the CP task compared to HH men. LH men showed significant reductions in high frequency power (vagal assessment) to the tasks compared to HH men.

,Bayesian Learning In Negotiation,"Negotiation has been extensively discussed in game-theoretic, economic and management science literatures for decades. Recent growing interest in autonomous interacting software agents and their potential application in areas such as electronic commerce has give increased importance to automated negotiation. Evidence both from theoretical analysis and from observations of human interactions suggests that if decision makers can somehow take into consideration what other agents are thinking and furthermore learn during their interactions how other agents behave, their payoff might increase. In this paper, we propose a sequential decision-making model of negotiation, called Bazaar.

,Behavioral And Physiological Correlates Of Goal-Directed Behavior,"The effects of a task complexity system, defined by a match or mismatch between subject's ability and task requirements, and goal setting on performance of a computer-based game were investigated in two studies using a 3x2x2 (Complexity System x Goal x Teial) design. In the first trial, undergraduate students (90 in Study 1 and 72 in Study 2) played the game under a low, balanced, or high task complexity system condition. The low complexity task system condition was characterized by high ability on the part of the subject coupled with low task demands. The reverse describes the high complexity task system condition. The balanced task complexity system condition matched subjects' ability with demands of the task. In the second trial, the same students either set performance goals or were told to do their best as they played the game. We concluded that balanced task complexity systems elicited active coping with task demands. Goal setting, however, altered the subjects' patterns of autonomic and behavioral responses. Across the goal and task complexity system conditions, performance outcomes were consistent with patterns of autonomic response. When parasympathetic withdrawal was accompanied by sympathetic overbalance, performance was lower. Performance was lower: (a) in the unbalanced task complexity systems when goals were self-set and (b) in the balanced systems when do-your-best goals were applied. When parasympathetic dominance was evident, performance was higher. Performance was higher: (a) in balanced task complexity systems when goals were self-set and (b) in the unbalanced systems when do-your-best goals were applied. Implications for these findings are discussed, and avenues for future research are outlined. © 1993, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

,"Behavioral Response Demands, Cardiovascular Reactivity, And Essential Hypertension","Psychophysiologic reactions to behavioral challenges were examined in men aged 55 or less with no prior history of cardiovascular disorder. Three age-matched groups of twelve were recruited through factory screening: mild hypertensives (blood pressure in the range 175/105-145/90 persisting on retest), transient hypertensives (blood pressure above criterion on screening, falling on retest), and normotensives. Clinical examination, a laboratory rest session and period of blood pressure self-monitoring were followed by a laboratory stress session. The latter involved performance of two tasks demanding active behavioral coping (the Stroop interference task and video game) and one passive condition (a distressing movie). Mild hypertensives showed significantly greater pressor reactions (both in absolute and percentage terms) than normotensives to tasks requiring active behavioral coping, but not to the passive condition. The transient hypertension group produced heightened reactions in diastolic but not systolic pressure. Greater heart rate and pulse transit time reactions were also observed in the transient group, suggesting that exaggerated cardiac responsiveness to active challenges may be characteristic of the prehypertensive profile. No differences were recorded in electrodermal or respiratory variables, or in self-reported tension. Exaggerated pressor responses were also associated with high scores on the Hostility and Direction of Hostility questionnaire, and an absence of coronary-prone behavior. Implications for the etiology of essential hypertension are considered.",doi,10.1097/00006842-198401000-00006,Scopus,Psychosomatic Medicine,"Steptoe A., Melville D., Ross A.",1984,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Being In The Zone: Physiological Markers Of Togetherness In Joint Improvisation,"Performers improvising together describe special moments of ‘being in the zone’ – periods of high performance, synchrony, and enhanced sense of togetherness. Existing evidence suggests a possible route for attaining togetherness – interpersonal synchrony, the fine-grained sensory-motor coordination that promotes social connectedness. Here, we investigated the physiological characteristics of togetherness using a practice from theater and dance, the mirror game. Pairs of expert improvisers jointly improvised synchronized linear motion, while their motion tracks and cardiovascular activity were continuously monitored. Players also provided dynamic ratings of togetherness while watching video recordings of their games. We identified periods of togetherness using kinematic and subjective markers and assessed their physiological characteristics. The kinematic and the subjective measures of togetherness showed some agreement, with more extensive game periods being marked by the subjective than the kinematic one. Game rounds with high rates of togetherness were characterized by increased players’ cardiovascular activity, increased correlation of players’ heart rates (HRs), and increased motion intensity. By comparing motion segments with similar motion intensity, we showed that moments of togetherness in the mirror game were marked by increased players’ HRs, regardless of motion intensity. This pattern was robust for the subjectively defined periods of togetherness, while showing a marginal effect for the kinematically defined togetherness. Building upon similar findings in flow research we suggest that the observed increase of players’ HRs during togetherness periods in the mirror game might indicate the enhanced engagement and enjoyment reported by performers going into ‘the zone.’ The suggested approach, combining temporal measurements of kinematic, physiological and subjective responses, demonstrates how the dynamics of spontaneously emerging dyadic states can be studied empirically. © 2015 Noy, Levit-Binunand Golland.",doi,10.3389/fnhum.2015.00187,Scopus,Frontiers in Human Neuroscience,"Noy L., Levit-Binun N., Golland Y.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Beta-Adrenergic Receptor Gene Polymorphisms And Cardiovascular Reactivity To Stress In Black Adolescents And Young Adults,"Cardiovascular reactivity to stress and β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) function may contribute to the development of hypertension. As Black Americans have an increased risk of hypertension, we evaluated associations between β1-AR (Arg389Gly) and β2-AR (Arg16Gly, Gln27Glu) gene variants and cardiovascular reactivity in 500 Black youth. Heart rate, preejection period, total peripheral resistance, and blood pressure reactivity were measured during cold and psychological stress. The Arg389Gly polymorphism in the β1-AR was associated with preejection period reactivity in males but not in females. The Arg16Gly polymorphism in the β2-AR was associated with diastolic blood pressure reactivity only during video game stress. An association between the Gln27Glu polymorphism in the β2-AR and vascular reactivity depended on sex. Thus, specific patterns of associations emerged between genetic variations in β-ARs and cardiovascular reactivity in young Blacks.

,Beyond Entertainment,"The percentage of older adults who are active gamers has increased tremendously in recent years. Although research shows that video games enhance physical and cognitive well-being in older adults, the role of video games in enhancing social interactions has been relatively understudied. We examined the habits, preferences, motivations, and outcomes of video gameplay among older and younger adults who play games with their family members. The findings reveal that sharing in video games does foster relationships and connections while producing positive emotions for both generations. As a consequence, game designers should take into consideration ways to enhance these social aspects of gameplay. © The Author(s) 2015.",doi,10.1177/1555412015602819,Scopus,Games and Culture,"Osmanovic S., Pecchioni L., Prof.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Biopad: Leveraging Off-The-Shelf Video Games For Stress Self-Regulation.,"This paper presents an approach to use commercial videogames for biofeedback training. It consists of intercepting signals from the game controller and adapting them in real-time based on physiological measurements from the player. We present three sample implementations and a case study for teaching stress self-regulation via an immersive car racing game. We use a crossover gaming device to manipulate controller signals, and a respiratory sensor to monitor the players' breathing rate. We then alter the speed of the car to encourage slow, deep breathing, in this way allowing players to reduce their arousal while playing the game. We evaluate the approach against an alternative form of biofeedback that uses a graphic overlay to convey physiological information, and a control condition (playing the game without biofeedback). Experimental results show that our approach can promote deep breathing during gameplay, and also during a subsequent task, once biofeedback is removed. Our results also indicate that delivering biofeedback through subtle changes in gameplay can be as effective as delivering them directly through a visual display. These results open the possibility to develop low-cost and engaging biofeedback interventions using a variety of commercial videogames to promote adherence.",doi,10.1109/JBHI.2017.2671788,pubmed,IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,"Wang, Zelun; Parnandi, Avinash; Gutierrez-Osuna, Ricardo",2017,NA,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Blend Shape Interpolation And Facs For Realistic Avatar,"Abstract: The quest of developing realistic facial animation is ever-growing. The emergence of sophisticated algorithms, new graphical user interfaces, laser scans and advanced 3D tools imparted further impetus towards the rapid advancement of complex virtual human facial model. Face-to-face communication being the most natural way of human interaction, the facial animation systems became more attractive in the information technology era for sundry applications. The production of computer-animated movies using synthetic actors are still challenging issues. Proposed facial expression carries the signature of happiness, sadness, angry or cheerful, etc. The mood of a particular person in the midst of a large group can immediately be identified via very subtle changes in facial expressions. Facial expressions being very complex as well as important nonverbal communication channel are tricky to synthesize realistically using computer graphics. Computer synthesis of practical facial expressions must deal with the geometric representation of the human face and the control of the facial animation. We developed a new approach by integrating blend shape interpolation (BSI) and facial action coding system (FACS) to create a realistic and expressive computer facial animation design. The BSI is used to generate the natural face while the FACS is employed to reflect the exact facial muscle movements for four basic natural emotional expressions such as angry, happy, sad and fear with high fidelity. The results in perceiving the realistic facial expression for virtual human emotions based on facial skin color and texture may contribute towards the development of virtual reality and game environment of computer aided graphics animation systems.Graphical Abstract: Realistic facial expressions of avatar. © 2015, 3D Research Center, Kwangwoon University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",doi,10.1007/s13319-015-0038-7,Scopus,3D Research,"Alkawaz M.H., Mohamad D., Basori A.H., Saba T.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Body In The Interactive Game: How Interface Embodiment Affects Physical Activity And Health Behavior Change,"Does the delivery platform for a health behavior game contribute to its effectiveness? With the growing popularity of interactive video games that combine physical exercise with gameplay, known as ""exergames,"" there has been a burgeoning interest in their impact on users' exercise attitudes and behavioral outcomes. This study examines how the level of user interface embodiment, the degree to which the user's body interacts with the game, affects the user's experience, game behavior, and intention for behavior change. We conducted a between-participants experiment in which participants (N = 119) played an exergame under one of the three levels of user interface embodiment (low, medium, and high). Our results revealed a significant positive main effect of user interface embodiment on user experience (i.e., the sense of being in the game, ""presence,"" and enjoyment); level of energy expenditure (change in heart rate); and intention to further engage in exergame-play exercise but not necessarily to increase exercise in the physical world. A further analysis revealed the mediating roles of user experience in the association between user interface embodiment and intention to repeat exergaming and a potential link between heart rate change and level of presence in the game. We conclude that type of interface is a key variable in this health communication environment, affecting user experience, behavior, and some intention for behavior change. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The current paper uses video game violence research as an example of how such issues may develop in a field. Despite decades of research, evidence on whether violent video games (VVGs) contribute to aggression in players has remained mixed. Concerns have been raised in recent years that experiments regarding VVGs may suffer from both “false positives” and “false negatives.” The current paper examines this issue in three sets of video game experiments, two sets of video game experiments on aggression and prosocial behaviors identified in meta-analysis, and a third group of recent null studies. Results indicated that studies of VVGs and aggression appear to be particularly prone to false positive results. Studies of VVGs and prosocial behavior, by contrast are heterogeneous and did not demonstrate any indication of false positive results. However, their heterogeneous nature made it difficult to base solid conclusions on them. By contrast, evidence for false negatives in null studies was limited, and little evidence emerged that null studies lacked power in comparison those highlighted in past meta-analyses as evidence for effects.

,Brain Maps Of Iowa Gambling Task,"Background: Somatic Marker Hypothesis (SMH), based on clinical observations, delineates neuronal networks for interpreting consciousness generation and decision-making. The Iowa gambling task (IGT) was designed to verify the SMH. However, more and more behavioral and brain imaging studies had reported incongruent results that pinpointed a need to re-evaluate the central representations of SMH. The current study used event-related fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) to examine neural correlates of anticipation vs. outcome, wins vs. losses, and differential decks' contingencies of IGT. Results: Behavioral results showed a prominent effect of frequency in driving choices. The insula and basal ganglia were activated during the anticipation phase while the inferior parietal lobule was activated during the outcome phase. The activation of medial prefrontal cortex was especially targeted during the high punishment contingencies. The data suggest that under uncertainty the normal decision makers can become myopic. Conclusion: The insula and basal ganglia might play a vital role in long-term guidance of decision-making. Inferior parietal lobule might participate in evaluating the consequence and medial prefrontal cortex may service the function of error monitoring. © 2008 Lin et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",doi,10.1186/1471-2202-9-72,Scopus,BMC Neuroscience,"Lin C.-H., Chiu Y.-C., Cheng C.-M., Hsieh J.-C.",2008,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Brain Natriuretic Hormone Predicts Stress-Induced Alterations In Diastolic Function,"Background: Mental stress (MS) reduces diastolic function (DF) and may lead to congestive heart failure with preserved systolic function. Whether brain natriuretic hormone (brain natriuretic peptide [BNP]) mediates the relationship of MS with DF is unknown.Methods: One hundred sixty individuals aged 30 to 50 years underwent 2-hour protocol of 40-minute rest, videogame stressor and recovery. Hemodynamics, pro-BNP samples and DF indices were obtained throughout the protocol. Separate regression analyses were conducted using rest and stress E/A, E' and E/E' as dependent variables. Predictor variables were entered into the stepwise regression models in a hierarchical fashion. At the first level, age, sex, race, height, body mass index, pro-BNP and left ventricular mass (LVM) were permitted to enter the models. The second level consisted of systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR). The final level contained cross-product terms of race by SBP, DBP and HR.Results: E/A ratio was lower during stress compared to rest and recovery (P &lt; 0.01). Resting E/A ratio was predicted by a regression model of age (-0.31), pro-BNP (0.16), HR (-0.40) and DBP (-0.23) with an R2 = 0.33. Stress E/A ratio was predicted by age (-0.24), pro-BNP (0.08), HR (-0.38) and SBP (-0.21) with total R2 = 0.22. Resting E' model consisted of age (-0.22), pro-BNP (0.26), DBP (-0.27) and LVM (-0.15) with an R2 = 0.29. Stress E' was predicted by age (-0.18), pro-BNP (0.35) and LVM (-0.18) with an R2 = 0.18. Resting E/E' was predicted by race (0.17, B. W) and DBP (0.24) with an R2 = 0.10. Stress E/E' consisted of pro-BNP (-0.36), height (-0.26) and HR (-0.21) with an R2 = 0.15.Conclusions: pro-BNP predicts both resting and stress DF, suggesting that lower BNP during MS may be a marker of diastolic dysfunction in apparently healthy individuals. © 2014 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",doi,10.1097/MAJ.0000000000000261,Scopus,American Journal of the Medical Sciences,"Choksy P., Davis H.C., Januzzi J., Thayer J., Harshfield G., Robinson V.J.B., Kapuku G.K.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Brand Logo Placements In Violent Games: Effects Of Violence Cues On Memory And Attitude Through Arousal And Presence,"With the general aggression model and presence (i.e., sense of ""being there"") theory as frameworks, this study investigates the effects of violence cues (blood and screams of pain) and players' individual differences in aggression (trait aggression) on brand logo memory and on attitude change in a violent first-person shooter game (Half-Life 2). Physiological arousal (skin conductance levels) was assessed during game play and participants reported their sense of presence in the game. Results indicate that violence cues influence brand logo memory through engagement and affect attitude change via arousal. Although physiological arousal led to positive change in brand attitude, it does not significantly influence logo memory. Conversely, although higher levels of spatial presence led to better logo memory, there was a corresponding reduction in attitude change for highly recognized brands. We consider the possibility that increased memory but negative attitude change with higher presence in violent video games could deter advertisers from placing their messages inside violent games. © 2011 American Academy of Advertising.

,Can A Virtual Patient Trainer Teach Student Nurses How To Save Lives-Teaching Nursing Students About Pediatric Respiratory Diseases,"Introduction: Virtual environments offer a variety of benefits and may be a powerful medium with which to provide nursing education. The objective of this study was to compare the achievement of learning outcomes of undergraduate nursing students when a virtual patient trainer or a traditional lecture was used to teach pediatric respiratory content. Methods: This was a randomized, controlled, posttest design. A virtual pediatric hospital unit was populated with four virtual pediatric patients having different respiratory diseases that were designed to meet the same learning objectives as a traditional lecture. The study began in Spring 2010 with 93 Senior I, baccalaureate nursing students. Students were randomized to receive either a traditional lecture or an experience with a virtual patient trainer. Students' knowledge acquisition was evaluated using multiple-choice questions, and knowledge application was measured as timeliness of care in two simulated clinical scenarios using high-fidelity mannequins and standardized patients. Results: Ninety-three students participated in the study, of which 46 were in the experimental group that received content using the virtual patient trainer. After the intervention, students in the experimental group had significantly higher knowledge acquisition (P = 0.004) and better knowledge application (P = 0.001) for each of the two scenarios than students in the control group. Conclusions: The purpose of this project was to compare a virtual patient trainer to a traditional lecture for the achievement of learning outcomes for pediatric respiratory content. Although the virtual patient trainer experience produced statistically better outcomes, the differences may not be clinically significant. The results suggest that a virtual patient trainer may be an effective substitute for the achievement of learning outcomes that are typically met using a traditional lecture format. Further research is needed to understand how best to integrate a virtual patient trainer into undergraduate nursing education.

,Cardiac And Metabolic Activity In Mild Hypertensive And Normotensive Subjects,"Heart rate, respiration, and metabolic activity were monitored at rest and during the mental challenge of a video game in 22 mild hypertensive and 53 normotensive young men. Subjects also completed the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire and the Jenkins Activity Survey. The mild hypertensive subjects displayed higher resting heart rates than the normotensives and larger magnitude heart rate increases to the video game. Although groups did not differ in resting respiratory activity, the metabolic rates tended to be higher in the mild hypertensives and they showed reliably greater increases in oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production during mental challenge. These data were subjected to a variety of interpretations. However, in the absence of psychophysiological assessment during physical exertion, and without direct measurement of cardiao output and arteriovenous oxygen differences, the present results did not permit a choice to be made between rival explanations, and they certainly cannot discount the hypothesis that some borderline hypertensives display excessive cardiac activity and tissue overperfusion during stress. The personality measures did not differentiate groups. However, correlational analyses within each group revealed that whereas systolic blood pressure was positively and significantly related to neuroticism in the mild hypertensive group, for the normotensive subjects the direction of correlation was reversed. In addition, scores on the Jenkins Activity Survey correlated positively with heart rate reactivity to the video game for the mild hypertensives, but not for the normotensives.

,Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Training In High School Using Avatars In Virtual Worlds: An International Feasibility Study,"Background: Approximately 300,000 people suffer sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) annually in the United States. Less than 30% of out-of-hospital victims receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) despite the American Heart Association training over 12 million laypersons annually to conduct CPR. New engaging learning methods are needed for CPR education, especially in schools. Massively multiplayer virtual worlds (MMVW) offer platforms for serious games that are promising learning methods that take advantage of the computer capabilities of today's youth (ie, the digital native generation). Objective: Our main aim was to assess the feasibility of cardiopulmonary resuscitation training in high school students by using avatars in MMVM. We also analyzed experiences, self-efficacy, and concentration in response to training. Methods: In this prospective international collaborative study, an e-learning method was used with high school students in Sweden and the United States. A software game platform was modified for use as a serious game to train in emergency medical situations. Using MMVW technology, participants in teams of 3 were engaged in virtual-world scenarios to learn how to treat victims suffering cardiac arrest. Short debriefings were carried out after each scenario. A total of 36 high school students (Sweden, n=12; United States, n=24) participated. Their self-efficacy and concentration (task motivation) were assessed. An exit questionnaire was used to solicit experiences and attitudes toward this type of training. Among the Swedish students, a follow-up was carried out after 6 months. Depending on the distributions, t tests or Mann-Whitney tests were used. Correlation between variables was assessed by using Spearman rank correlation. Regression analyses were used for time-dependent variables. Results: The participants enjoyed the training and reported a self-perceived benefit as a consequence of training. The mean rating for self-efficacy increased from 5.8/7 (SD 0.72) to 6.5/7 (SD 0.57, P<.001). In the Swedish follow-up, it subsequently increased from 5.7/7 (SD 0.56) to 6.3/7 (SD 0.38, P=.006). In the Swedish group, the mean concentration value increased from 52.4/100 (SD 9.8) to 62.7/100 (SD 8.9, P=.05); in the US group, the concentration value increased from 70.8/100 (SD 7.9) to 82.5/100 (SD 4.7, P<.001). We found a significant positive correlation (P<.001) between self-efficacy and concentration scores. Overall, the participants were moderately or highly immersed and the software was easy to use. Conclusions: By using online MMVWs, team training in CPR is feasible and reliable for this international group of high school students (Sweden and United States). A high level of appreciation was reported among these adolescents and their self-efficacy increased significantly. The described training is a novel and interesting way to learn CPR teamwork, and in the future could be combined with psychomotor skills training. © Filippo Castiglione.",doi,10.2196/jmir.1715,Scopus,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"Creutzfel dt J., Hedman L., Heinrichs L., Youngblood P., Felländer-Tsai L.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Cardiovascular And Metabolic Activity At Rest And During Psychological And Physical Challenge In Normotensives And Subjects With Mildly Elevated Blood Pressure,"Heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and respiratory and metabolic activity were recorded prior to and during mental arithmetic and a video game task in 20 young men with mildly elevated casual systolic blood pressures. Twenty‐five unambiguously normotensive young men were tested under the same protocol. For pretask baseline physiological activity, group differences emerged for all cardiovascular and metabolic variables; thus the elevated blood pressure group displayed not only higher resting cardiovascular levels than normotensive subjects, but higher levels of metabolic activity too. With regard to change in physiological activity from rest to task, the group with mildly elevated blood pressure showed reliably larger increases in heart rate to the mental arithmetic task than the normotensive subjects. These effects, however, were not paralleled by group differences in metabolic activity increase. Physiological measures were also taken prior to and during graded dynamic exercise. The subsequent calculation of individual heart rate‐oxygen consumption exercise regression lines allowed the comparison of actual and predicted heart rates during psychological challenge. The subjects with mildly elevated blood pressure displayed significantly greater discrepancies between actual and predicted heart rate values than normotensives during the psychological tasks in general and menta1 arithmetic in particular. Group differences in physiological activity during exercise largely reflected the pattern seen at rest. A possible exception here was systolic blood pressure. Not only were systolic blood pressure levels higher throughout the exercise phase for mildly elevated blood pressure subjects, but this group evidenced more of an increase from rest to exercise than the normotensives.

,Cardiovascular Effects In Adolescents While They Are Playing Video Games: A Potential Health Risk Factor?,"We analyzed heart rate (HR), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), oxygen consumption, and carbon dioxide production in 17 male adolescents during a racing simulation video game (VG) and compared to resting state (RS) and exercise testing (ET) measures. We were able to demonstrate a significant (p<.005) increase from RS to VG concerning HR (+13.1 bpm), SBP (+20.8 mmHg), and DBP (+12.1 mmHg) with SBP and DBP elevations exceeding 2 SD in all children and 14/17 children, respectively. The energy consumption during VG (max 1.71 kcal/min) was unaltered compared to RS and significantly lower compared to ET even at the starting strain of 25 W (1.94 kcal/min). Hemodynamic parameters tested demonstrated lower HR, unchanged SBP, and higher DBP during the VG compared with ET. Comparing all measured parameters it can be said that the relation of blood pressure and energy consumption during VG might not be favorable.

,Changes In Testosterone Mediate The Effect Of Winning On Subsequent Aggressive Behaviour,"Testosterone concentrations rise rapidly in the context of competitive interactions and remain elevated in winners relative to losers. Theoretical models suggest that this divergent neuroendocrine response serves to mediate future dominance behaviours. Although research in animal models provides compelling support for this model, evidence for its applicability to human social behaviour is limited. In the current study, men and women were randomly assigned to experience a series of victories or defeats, after which aggressive behaviour was assessed using a well-validated behavioural measure. Winning produced elevated testosterone concentrations relative to losing in men, but not women. More importantly, testosterone reactivity to competition mediated the effect of winning on subsequent aggressive behaviour in men, but not women. We discuss limitations of the current study (e.g., the status manipulation may have affected other variables not measured in the study including competitiveness and physical activity expended), as well as discuss a potential neural mechanism underlying the effect of testosterone reactivity on aggressive behaviour. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.psyneuen.2013.03.008,Scopus,Psychoneuroendocrinology,"Carré J.M., Campbell J.A., Lozoya E., Goetz S.M.M., Welker K.M.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Characterizing Mood Management As Need Satisfaction: The Effects Of Intrinsic Needs On Selective Exposure And Mood Repair,This study attempted to (a) extend traditional mood management theory research by investigating the influence of the intrinsic needs for competence and autonomy on selective exposure to video games and (b) test the influence of satisfying these needs on resultant mood repair. An experiment varied satisfaction of competence and autonomy needs using false feedback. Subjects then selected media that varied in level of user demand. Measures of need satisfaction were taken before and after media selection. Results demonstrated that (a) thwarted intrinsic needs significantly predict the choice of video games with different levels of user demand and (b) the satisfaction of these needs predicts enjoyment. Findings indicate that mood management can result from mood repair through need satisfaction. © 2012 International Communication Association.,doi,10.1111/j.1460-2466.2012.01649.x,Scopus,Journal of Communication,"Reinecke L., Tamborini R., Grizzard M., Lewis R., Eden A., David Bowman N.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Children's Spontaneous Emotional Expressions While Receiving (Un)Wanted Prizes In The Presence Of Peers.,"Although current emotion theories emphasize the importance of contextual factors for emotional expressive behavior, developmental studies that examine such factors are currently thin on the ground. In this research, we studied the course of emotional expressions of 8- and 11-year-old children after winning a (large) first prize or a (substantially smaller) consolation prize, while playing a game competing against the computer or a physically co-present peer. We analyzed their emotional reactions by conducting two perception tests in which participants rated children's level of happiness. Results showed that co-presence positively affected children's happiness only when receiving the first prize. Moreover, for children who were in the presence of a peer, we found that eye contact affected children's expressions of happiness, but that the effect was different for different age groups: 8-year-old children were negatively affected, and 11-year-old children positively. Overall, we can conclude that as children grow older and their social awareness increases, the presence of a peer affects their non-verbal expressions, regardless of their appreciation of their prize.",doi,10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01401,pubmed,Frontiers in psychology,"Visser, Mandy; Krahmer, Emiel; Swerts, Marc",2015,NA,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Children's Understanding Of Others' Emotional States: Inferences From Extralinguistic Or Paralinguistic Cues?,"The ability to infer the emotional states of others is central to our everyday interactions. These inferences can be drawn from several different sources of information occurring simultaneously in the communication situation. Based on previous studies revealing that children pay more heed to situational context than to emotional prosody when inferring the emotional states of others, we decided to focus on this issue, broadening the investigation to find out whether the natural combination of emotional prosody and faces (that is, paralinguistic cues) can overcome the dominance of situational context (that is, extralinguistic cues), and if so, at what age? In Experiment 1, children aged 3-9 years played a computer game in which they had to judge the emotional state of a character, based on two sources of information (that is, extralinguistic and paralinguistic) that were either congruent or conflicting. In Condition 1, situational context was compared with emotional prosody; in Condition 2, situational context was compared with emotional prosody combined with emotional faces. In a complementary study (Experiment 2) the same 3-year-olds performed recognition tasks with the three cues presented in isolation. Results highlighted the fundamental role of both cues, as a) situational context dominated prosody in all age groups, but b) the combination of emotional facial expression and prosody overcame this dominance, especially among the youngest and oldest children. We discuss our findings in the light of previous research and theories of both language and emotional development. © The Author(s) 2014.",doi,10.1177/0165025414535123,Scopus,International Journal of Behavioral Development,"Gil S., Aguert M., Bigot L.L., Lacroix A., Laval V.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,"Children, Video Games And Physical Activity: An Exploratory Study","Media consumption and video gameplay can contribute to a sedentary lifestyle. Nevertheless, video games may have the potential to actually enhance children's physical activity. Objective: To explore the potential of video games to contribute to children's health and physical activity. Study Group: Twelve British children (seven female, five male) aged 8-11 years. Methods'. Th children participated in daily video-game play during school lunch times for one week. Focus group interviews were employed, pre and post the game play week, to examine children's perceptions of video games in relation to physical activity and health. Physical activity was assessed during all game play periods using pedometry and heart rate monitoring. Results: Pre the game play period, all children reported that video games had a negative impact on health and physical activity. Post game play, children reported that active video gameplay was an attractive alternative to traditional forms of physical activity that might be more attractive to nonexercisers. The results during the gameplay period revealed that boys and girls accumulated 10% and 11% of the recommended number of steps/day for health and also engaged in an average of 11 minutes (or 46% of the monitoring period) sustained moderate to vigorous physical activity through active video gaming each day. Conclusions: Although video games have traditionally been regarded as a negative influence on children's physical activity, active video games may provide a viable alternative to traditional physical activity. Even a short duration of daily active video-game play can contribute significantly to children achieving the recommended daily volume of physical activity. © 2011, Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co.

,Chill-Inducing Music Enhances Altruism In Humans,"Music is a universal feature of human cultures, and it has both fascinated and troubled many researchers. In this paper we show through the Dictator Game that an individual's listening to preferred ""chill-inducing"" music may promote altruistic behavior that extends beyond the bounds of kin selection or reciprocal altruism. Participants were 22 undergraduate and postgraduate students who were divided into two groups, the In-group (IG) and the Out-group (OG), and they acted as dictators. The dictators listened to their own preferred ""chill-inducing"" music, to music they disliked, or to silence, and then played the Dictator Game. In this hypothetical experiment, the dictators were given real money (which they did not keep) and were asked to distribute it to the recipients, who were presented as stylized images of men and women displayed on a computer screen. The dictators played the Dictator Game both before and after listening to the music. Both male and female dictators gave more money after listening to their preferred music and less after listening to the music they disliked, whereas silence had no effect on the allocated amounts. The group to which the recipient belonged did not influence these trends. The results suggest that listening to preferred ""chill-inducing"" music promotes altruistic behavior. © 2014 Fukui and Toyoshima.",doi,10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01215,Scopus,Frontiers in Psychology,"Fukui H., Toyoshima K.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Cnt Nanobombs For Specific Eradication Of Cancer Cells: A New Concept In Cancer Theranostics.,"Whole extermination of cancerous cells/tissue seems no longer to be a dream. Exploiting advanced photoactive nanomaterials such as functionalized fullerenes and carbon nano-tubes (CNTs) can act as CNT nanobombs (CNT-NBs) when exposed to the near infrared (NIR) radiation. PEGylated CNTs tagged with an antibody/aptamer can target cancer cells. Once attached to cancer cells, the NIR emission (700-1100 nm), in which body tissues are mostly transparent, can be applied to CNT-NBs which can absorb the light and get heated up. The resultant enhanced temperature can abolish the cancer. Once stealth CNT-NBs are tagged with imaging moieties, it would be a matter of computer gaming for physician who can inject it for real time visualization and destruction of cancer by activation of the NIR laser. While, many nanosystems (NSs) are still in waiting list for clinical translation, our dreams may come true by applying stealth CNT-NBs against cancer.",doi,10.5681/bi.2011.028,pubmed,BioImpacts : BI,"Omidi, Yadollah",2013,NA,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Co-Constructing An Agent-Based Model To Mediate Land Use Conflict Between Herders And Foresters In Northern Thailand,"In conservation areas, land use conflicts frequently occur due to the increasing number of land resource managers and users who usually have different interests, objectives and perceptions. Sharing all these a priori legitimate differences is a prerequisite for better collective management of the land. The companion modelling approach is used to build a shared representation of interactions between vegetation dynamics, reforestation efforts and livestock grazing in a forest conservation area of northern Thailand. This article focuses on the participatory modelling process that led to the co-construction of an agent-based model. Sensitizing exercises on vegetation dynamics and an agent-based simulator associated with a role-playing game were the main tools used. The social interactions and decision-making processes observed during the gaming and simulation sessions were used to construct a set of rules implemented in a subsequent autonomous agent-based model. It will be used to simulate future land management scenarios with local stakeholders. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.",doi,10.1080/1747423X.2011.558596,Scopus,Journal of Land Use Science,"Dumrongrojwatthana P., Le Page C., Gajaseni N., Trébuil G.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Cognitive Improvement Of Schizophrenia Patients: Enhancing Cognition While Enjoying Computer-Aided Cognitive Training,"Cognitive deficits are a core symptom in schizophrenia, but until now controlled efficacy studies of cognitive training methods have shown inconclusive results. This study examined the effects of computer-aided cognitive training using motivational software that evokes positive emotions in patients suffering from schizophrenia. Forty patients were included: twenty of them received cognitive training; twenty received occupational therapy. Both before and after treatment, all patients were assessed with a battery of neuropsychological tests measuring executive functions, attention and verbal memory. Enhancing effects on executive functioning level and verbal memory could be found. At the same time, effects on positive and negative symptom levels could be observed. Changes in symptom levels and cognitive improvement were uncorrelated. Our findings imply that cognitive achievement of schizophrenia patients can be improved using pleasant and ""game-like"" cognitive training tasks. This may be due to a motivating effect and, to a greater extent, because these tasks cause enhanced processing.",doi,10.3371/CSRP.1.4.2,Scopus,Clinical Schizophrenia and Related Psychoses,"Trapp W., Hasmann A., Gallhofer B., Schwerdtner J., Guenther W., Dobmeier M.",2008,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Collaborative Framework Of An Intelligent Agent System For Efficient Logistics Transport Planning,"In modern logistics chain, planning system which been applied for supporting daily operations, is becoming more information-intensive and technologically-dependent. Due to the growing operational complexities, the planning system is not only required to focus on ensuring the feasibility of daily plan, but also be capable of manipulating conflict of interest (COI) by exploiting efficient negotiation. This paper addresses a challenge of hinterland transport planning caused by limited information sharing, lack of collaboration and COI. We design collaboration and decision-making mechanisms for the implementation of autonomous control by means of multi agent technology and hybrid heuristics. It aims at providing quality plan to achieve high level of performance and robustness in hinterland logistics. From a system point of view, a service oriented architecture is proposed to integrate agent paradigm with a web-based planning system. From an operational point of view, special attentions are paid on establishing multi-dimensional collaborations between different stakeholders under the support of game theoretic approach. Specifically, we define how planning activities are executed, which level of collaborations are incorporated and how benefits are achieved with a global point of view. Due to the NP-hard nature of the addressed problem, an integrated NGSA-II and simulated annealing algorithm is implemented for assisting decision making. The parameters associated with the algorithm are tuned based on the Taguchi method. Case and comparative study will be presented to validate the appropriateness and performance of the approach. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",doi,10.1016/j.cie.2016.12.044,Scopus,Computers and Industrial Engineering,"Feng F., Pang Y., Lodewijks G., Li W.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Computational Substrates Of Norms And Their Violations During Social Exchange,"Social norms in humans constrain individual behaviors to establish shared expectations within a social group. Previous work has probed social norm violations and the feelings that such violations engender; however, a computational rendering of the underlying neural and emotional responses has been lacking. We probed norm violations using a two-party, repeated fairness game (ultimatum game) where proposers offer a split of a monetary resource to a responder who either accepts or rejects the offer. Using a norm-training paradigm where subject groups are preadapted to either high or low offers, we demonstrate that unpredictable shifts in expected offers creates a difference in rejection rates exhibited by the two responder groups for otherwise identical offers. We constructed an ideal observer model that identified neural correlates of norm prediction errors in the ventral striatum and anterior insula, regions that also showed strong responses to variance-prediction errors generated by the same model. Subjective feelings about offers correlated with these norm prediction errors, and the two signals displayed overlapping, but not identical, neural correlates in striatum, insula, and medial orbito-frontal cortex. These results provide evidence for the hypothesis that responses in anterior insula can encode information about social norm violations that correlate with changes in overt behavior (changes in rejection rates). Together, these results demonstrate that the brain regions involved in reward prediction and risk prediction are also recruited in signaling social norm violations. © 2013 the authors.",doi,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1642-12.2013,Scopus,Journal of Neuroscience,"Xiang T., Lohrenz T., Montague P.R.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia

,Computer Poker: A Review,"The game of poker has been identified as a beneficial domain for current AI research because of the properties it possesses such as the need to deal with hidden information and stochasticity. The identification of poker as a useful research domain has inevitably resulted in increased attention from academic researchers who have pursued many separate avenues of research in the area of computer poker. The poker domain has often featured in previous review papers that focus on games in general, however a comprehensive review paper with a specific focus on computer poker has so far been lacking in the literature. In this paper, we present a review of recent algorithms and approaches in the area of computer poker, along with a survey of the autonomous poker agents that have resulted from this research. We begin with the first serious attempts to create strong computerised poker players by constructing knowledge-based and simulation-based systems. This is followed by the use of computational game theory to construct robust poker agents and the advances that have been made in this area. Approaches to constructing exploitive agents are reviewed and the challenging problems of creating accurate and dynamic opponent models are addressed. Finally, we conclude with a selection of alternative approaches that have received attention in previously published material and the interesting problems that they pose. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

,"Computers, Physicians, And The Diagnostic Decision-Making Process","Utilizing computer gaming techniques, a pilot experiment was conducted which located several possible parameters relating to degree of difficulty of diagnosis in internal medicine; private physicians served as subjects and the field of inquiry was limited to functional and organic diseases of the respiratory system. A second study was then conducted in which a digital computer served the function of providing objective feedback to the M.D. during diagnosis, indicating the number and names of diseases consistent with each acquisition of new information about the patient. Performance of the subjects under the latter condition indicated significant behavioral changes when compared with the previous study.

Inter-task consistency was evaluated for five physiological parameters for all stressor pairings. Evidence of consistency in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output, and total peripheral resistance responses to all three stressors was observed. The highest and most consistent correlations across stressors were observed for cardiac output and total peripheral resistance responses.

,Content And Task-Based View Selection From Multiple Video Streams,"We present a content-aware multi-camera selection technique that uses object- and frame-level features. First objects are detected using a color-based change detector. Next trajectory information for each object is generated using multi-frame graph matching. Finally, multiple features including size and location are used to generate an object score. At frame-level, we consider total activity, event score, number of objects and cumulative object score. These features are used to generate score information using a multivariate Gaussian distribution. The algorithm. The best view is selected using a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN), which utilizes camera network information. DBN employs previous view information to select the current view thus increasing resilience to frequent switching. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated on three multi-camera setups with semi-overlapping fields of view: a basketball game, an indoor airport surveillance scenario and a synthetic outdoor pedestrian dataset. We compare the proposed view selection approach with a maximum score based camera selection criterion and demonstrate a significant decrease in camera flickering. The performance of the proposed approach is also validated through subjective testing. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",doi,10.1007/s11042-009-0355-z,Scopus,Multimedia Tools and Applications,"Daniyal F., Taj M., Cavallaro A.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Context Conditioning In Humans Using Commercially Available Immersive Virtual Reality,"Despite a wealth of knowledge on how humans and nonhuman animals learn to associate meaningful events with cues in the environment, far less is known about how humans learn to associate these events with the environment itself. Progress on understanding spatiotemporal contextual processes in humans has been slow in large measure by the methodological constraint of generating and manipulating immersive spatial environments in well-controlled laboratory settings. Fortunately, immersive Virtual Reality (iVR) technology has improved appreciably and affords a relatively straightforward methodology to investigate the role of context on learning, memory, and emotion while maintaining experimental control. Here, we review context conditioning literature in humans and describe challenges to study contextual learning in humans. We then provide details for a novel context threat (fear) conditioning paradigm in humans using a commercially available VR headset and a cross-platform game engine. This paradigm resulted in the acquisition of subjective threat, threat-conditioned defensive responses, and explicit threat memory. We make the paradigm publicly available and describe obstacles and solutions to optimize future studies of context conditioning using iVR. As computer technology advances to replicate the sensation of realistic environments, there are increasing opportunities to bridge the translational gap between rodent and human research on how context modulates cognition, which may ultimately lead to more optimal treatment strategies for anxiety- and stress-related disorders. © 2017 The Author(s).",doi,10.1038/s41598-017-08184-7,Scopus,Scientific Reports,"Kroes M.C.W., Dunsmoor J.E., Mackey W.E., McClay M., Phelps E.A.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Continuous Measurement Of Breaks In Presence: Psychophysiology And Orienting Responses,"Assessing presence using questionnaires can yield interesting insights into the user experience in virtual environments, but is also limited both in terms of reliability and validity. Breaks in presence (BIPs) are an interesting alternative, given that the researcher can assess them correctly. Prior studies on the psychophysiology of BIPs followed an exploratory approach by not providing a cognitive mechanism for BIPs and lacking in external validity. We argue that BIPs can be considered a special form of orienting responses involving both the real and the virtual world. In the first of the presented studies, we investigated which types of BIPs can be differentiated and to what degree they affect the user experience. In the second study, we modified a commercial video game by introducing the previously identified BIPs and recorded psychophysiological measurements. The results are in line with findings on orienting responses and should provide fertile ground for future research.

,Cooperation Without Deliberation: A Minimal Behavior-Based Approach To Multi-Robot Teams,"While terminology and some concepts of behavior-based robotics have become widespread, the central ideas are often lost as researchers try to scale behavior to higher levels of complexity. 'Hybrid systems' with model-based strategies that plan in terms of behaviors rather than simple actions have become common for higher-level behavior. We claim that a strict behavior-based approach can scale to higher levels of complexity than many robotics researchers assume, and that the resulting systems are in many cases more efficient and robust than those that rely on 'classical AI' deliberative approaches. Our focus is on systems of cooperative autonomous robots in dynamic environments. We will discuss both claims that deliberation and explicit communication are necessary to cooperation and systems that cooperate only through environmental interaction. In this context we introduce three design principles for complex cooperative behavior - minimalism, statelessness and tolerance - and present a RoboCup soccer system that matches the sophistication of many deliberative soccer systems while exceeding their robustness, through the use of strict behavior-based techniques with no explicit communication.",doi,10.1016/S0004-3702(99)00023-5,Scopus,Artificial Intelligence,Werger B.B.,1999,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Corba-Based Analysis Of Multi Agent Behavior,"An agent is a computer software that is capable of taking independent action on behalf of its user or owner. It is an entity with goals, actions and domain knowledge, situated in an environment. Multiagent systems comprises of multiple autonomous, interacting computer software, or agents. These systems can successfully emulate the entities active in a distributed environment. The analysis of multiagent behavior has been studied in this paper based on a specific board game problem similar to the famous problem of GO. In this paper a framework is developed to define the states of the multiagent entities and measure the convergence metrics for this problem. An analysis of the changes of states leading to the goal state is also made. We support our study of multiagent behavior by simulations based on a CORBA framework in order to substantiate our findings. © 2005 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.",doi,10.1007/s11390-005-0013-5,Scopus,Journal of Computer Science and Technology,"Bhattacharya S., Banerjee A., Bandyopadhyay S.",2005,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Creating Autonomous Adaptive Agents In A Real-Time First-Person Shooter Computer Game,"Games are good test-beds to evaluate AI methodologies. In recent years, there has been a vast amount of research dealing with real-time computer games other than the traditional board games or card games. This paper illustrates how we create agents by employing FALCON, a self-organizing neural network that performs reinforcement learning, to play a well-known first-person shooter computer game called Unreal Tournament. Rewards used for learning are either obtained from the game environment or estimated using the temporal difference learning scheme. In this way, the agents are able to acquire proper strategies and discover the effectiveness of different weapons without any guidance or intervention. The experimental results show that our agents learn effectively and appropriately from scratch while playing the game in real-time. Moreover, with the previously learned knowledge retained, our agent is able to adapt to a different opponent in a different map within a relatively short period of time. © 2009-2012 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TCIAIG.2014.2336702,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games,"Wang D., Tan A.-H.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Creating Autonomous Agents For Playing Super Mario Bros Game By Means Of Evolutionary Finite State Machines,"This paper shows the design and improvement of an autonomous agent based in using evolutionary methods to improve behavioural models (finite state machines), which are part of the individuals to evolve. This leads to the obtention of a so-called bot that follows the Gameplay track rules of the international Mario AI Championship and is able to autonomously complete different scenarios on a simulator of Super Mario Bros. game. Mono- and multi-seed approaches (evaluation in one play or multiple plays respectively) have been analysed, in order to compare respectively the performance of an approach focused in solving a specific scenario, and another more general, devoted to obtain an agent which can play successfully in different scenarios. The analysis considers the machine resources consumption, which turns in a bottleneck in some experiments. However, the methods yield agents which can finish several stages of different difficulty levels, and playing much better than an expert human player, since they can deal with very difficult situations (several enemies surrounding Mario, for instance) in real time. According to the results and considering the competition’s restrictions (time limitations) and objectives (complete scenarios up to difficulty level 3), these agents have enough performance to participate in this competition track. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",doi,10.1007/s12065-014-0105-7,Scopus,Evolutionary Intelligence,"Mora A.M., Merelo J.J., García-Sánchez P., Castillo P.A., Rodríguez-Domingo M.S., Hidalgo-Bermúdez R.M.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Creating Stories For A Composite Form: Video Game Design As Frame Orchestration,"Storytelling in games in the early years of game studies was seen as being in conflict with gameplay. Departing from that debate, I argue that it is productive to see video games as a composite form supporting different frames for involvement. Against this backdrop the article reports an interview study with game developers, asking what it means to author stories for a composite form. The main results show that the developers do not see storytelling as the defining trait of video games, but as a component in a whole product. The developers display a specific gaze for how players shift their attention between frames. An important skill for the developers is to try to control these shifts in order to enforce the emotions they want the player to have. This specific skill is labelled framework orchestration. Stories are here but one of the tools the developers have at their disposal. © 2015 Intellect Ltd Article.",doi,10.1386/jgvw.7.3.279_1,Scopus,Journal of Gaming and Virtual Worlds,Linderoth J.,2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Cross-Modal Distractors Modulate Oscillatory Alpha Power: The Neural Basis Of Impaired Task Performance,"Unexpected novel sounds capture one's attention, even when irrelevant to the task pursued (e.g., playing video game). This often comes at a cost to the task (e.g., slower responding). The neural basis for this behavioral distraction effect is not well understood and is subject of this study. Our approach was motivated by findings from cuing paradigms suggesting a link between modulations in oscillatory activity and voluntary attention shifts. The current study tested whether oscillatory activity is also modulated by a task-irrelevant auditory distractor, reflecting a neural signature of an involuntary shift of attention and accounting for the impaired task performance. We reanalyzed magnetoencephalographic data collected via an auditory-visual distraction paradigm in which a task-relevant visual stimulus was preceded by a task-irrelevant sound on each trial. In 87.5% this was a regular sound (Standard); in 12.5% this was a novel sound (Distractor). We compared nonphase locked oscillatory activity in a time window prior to the visual target as a function of the experimental manipulation (Distractor, Standard). We found low power in the pretarget time window for Distractors compared to Standards in the alpha and beta frequency bands. Importantly, individual alpha power correlated with response speed on a trial-by-trial basis for the Distractor only. Sources were localized to the occipital cortex, and also to the parietal and supratemporal cortices. These findings support our hypothesis that the distractor-related alpha power modulation indexes an involuntary shift of attention which accounts for the impaired task performance. © 2016 Society for Psychophysiological Research.",doi,10.1111/psyp.12733,Scopus,Psychophysiology,"Weise A., Hartmann T., Schröger E., Weisz N., Ruhnau P.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Cultural Differences In Morality In The Real And Virtual Worlds: A Comparison Of Chinese And U.s. Youth,"In this research, we examined cultural differences in morality in the real and virtual worlds and the relationship between the two. Approximately 600 Chinese and 600 U.S. youth, average age 12 years old, completed surveys assessing their moral attitudes and behavior in the real world and the acceptability of a diverse set of morally questionable online behaviors. Findings indicated that (a) Chinese youth considered good moral character to be more important than did U.S. youth, whereas U.S. youth considered exceptions to moral behavior that advanced individual goals to be more acceptable than did Chinese youth; (b) Chinese females had the highest level of moral behavior, followed by U.S. females and then Chinese and U.S. males, who did not differ; (c) Chinese youth found morally questionable online behaviors to be more acceptable than did U.S. youth, with the exception of videogame violence, which U.S. youth, especially males, found more acceptable; (d) moral attitudes and behavior in the real world predicted the acceptability of morally questionable online behaviors, whereas the importance of good moral character and the extent of Internet and other technology use did not. The more accepting youth were of exceptions to moral behavior that advanced individual goals, and the less moral their behavior in the real world, the more acceptable they found morally questionable online behaviors. Cultural differences are explained in terms of differences in perceptions of cyberspace as a venue for expressing individual autonomy. © 2008 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",doi,10.1089/cpb.2007.0098,Scopus,Cyberpsychology and Behavior,"Jackson L.A., Zhao Y., Qiu W., Kolenic III A., Fitzgerald H.E., Harold R., Von Eye A.",2008,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Dancing With Physio: A Mobile Game With Physiologically Aware Virtual Humans,"This study presents an evaluation of a mobile game with physiologically aware virtual humans as an approach to modulate the participant's affective and physiological state. We developed a mobile version of a virtual reality scenario where the participants were able to interact with virtual human characters through their psychophysiological activity. Music was played in the background of the scenario and, depending on the experimental condition, the virtual humans were initially either barely dancing or dancing very euphorically. The task of the participants was to encourage the apathetic virtual humans to dance or to calm down the frenetically dancing characters, through the modulation of their own mood and physiological activity. Results from our study show that by using this mobile game with the physiologically aware and affective virtual humans the participants were able to emotionally arouse themselves in the Activation condition and were able to relax themselves in the Relaxation condition, during the same session with only a brief break between conditions. The self-reported affective data was also corroborated by the physiological data (heart rate, respiration and skin conductance) which significantly differed between the Activation and Relaxation conditions. © 2016 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TAFFC.2015.2472013,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing,"Arroyo-Palacios J., Slater M.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,"Deceptive Robot Motion: Synthesis, Analysis And Experiments","Much robotics research explores how robots can clearly communicate true information.

,Design On The Control System Of A Gait Rehabilitation Training Robot Based On Brain-Computer Interface And Virtual Reality Technology,"In this paper a control system of a gait rehabilitation training robot based on Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) and virtual reality technology is proposed, which makes the patients' rehabilitation training process more interesting. A technique for measuring the mental states of the human and associated applications based on normal brain signals are examined and evaluated firstly. Secondly, the virtual game starts with the information from the BCI and then it runs in the form of a thread, with the singleton design pattern as the main mode. Thirdly, through the synergistic cooperation with the main software, the virtual game can achieve quick and effective access to blood oxygen, heart rate and other physiological information of the patients. At the same time, by means of the hardware control system, the start-up of the gait rehabilitation training robot could be controlled accurately and effectively. Therefore, the plantar pressure information and the velocity information, together with the physiological information of the patients, would be properly reflected in the game lastly and the physical condition of the patients participating in rehabilitation training would also be reflected to a great extent. © 2012 Wang et al.",doi,10.5772/52457,Scopus,International Journal of Advanced Robotic Systems,"Wang H., Song Q., Zhang L., Liu Y.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Determining Factors In Choice Of Arcade Games And Their Consequences Upon Young Male Players.,"Two experiments, one conducted with male university students and the other with male high school and junior high school students, investigated (a) determinants of preferences for driving-type games widely available in public game arcades, and (b) the effects of extended play upon mood and motivation to continue playing. Four games were investigated: these were Death Race and Demolition Derby, which simulate violent, antisocial driving behavior; and Night Driver and Le Mans, which simulate skilled prosocial driving behavior. Preference for arcade games simulating aggressive behavior was found to be independent of personality and mood. However, preferences were closely related to the performers' c]apabilities. Players who exhibited higher levels of skill preferred the more skilldemanding games and those who showed less skill preferred aggression games, suggesting the operation of competency motivation in that the players preferred games appropriate to their level of skill. Subjects reported that the games were exciting, but extended play produced discomfort or an increase in negatively toned moods (fatigue, anxiety, and depression) and a decrease in positively toned moods (social affection, surgency, skepticism, concentration and vigor). However, these effects were not found to be a function of the anti- or prosocial content in the specific games studied and may well be effects accompanying activities that are subjectively fatiguing.",doi,10.1111/j.1559-1816.1985.tb02339.x,anderson2010,Journal of Applied Social Psychology,"Nelson, T.

,Different Slopes For Different Folks: Alpha And Delta Eeg Power Predict Subsequent Video Game Learning Rate And Improvements In Cognitive Control Tasks,"We hypothesized that control processes, as measured using electrophysiological (EEG) variables, influence the rate of learning of complex tasks. Specifically, we measured alpha power, event-related spectral perturbations (ERSPs), and event-related brain potentials during early training of the Space Fortress task, and correlated these measures with subsequent learning rate and performance in transfer tasks. Once initial score was partialled out, the best predictors were frontal alpha power and alpha and delta ERSPs, but not P300. By combining these predictors, we could explain about 50% of the learning rate variance and 10%-20% of the variance in transfer to other tasks using only pretraining EEG measures. Thus, control processes, as indexed by alpha and delta EEG oscillations, can predict learning and skill improvements. The results are of potential use to optimize training regimes. © 2012 Society for Psychophysiological Research.",doi,10.1111/j.1469-8986.2012.01474.x,Scopus,Psychophysiology,"Mathewson K.E., Basak C., Maclin E.L., Low K.A., Boot W.R., Kramer A.F., Fabiani M., Gratton G.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Differentiating Physiological Effects Of Midterm Break In A Prolonged Online Game Playing,"With the development of widespread Internet access, online game playing has become a popular event. As a result, more attention is being paid to the potentially negative physical and psychological effects on prolonged computer worker or online game player. To date, related physical problems that have been identified include fatigue, physical pain, insomnia, epileptic seizures, and even sudden death. Therefore, midterm break may be necessary for an online game player. This study tries to differentiate the physiological effects of two groups, with and without a midterm break, during a prolonged online game playing. Our experimental results showed that sympathetic system is overwhelming the parasympathetic nervous system significantly in group B without break, while it remains unchanged in group A. Due to the fight or flight response of the sympathetic system, participants with midterm break wanted to play more after event. Participants without break did not feel stressed after a continuous two hours' online game playing. These interesting findings may need further investigation in the future. © 2013 National Taiwan University.",doi,10.4015/S1016237213500579,Scopus,"Biomedical Engineering - Applications, Basis and Communications","Wong T.-Y., Shih D.-H., Tsai S.-Y., Lee C.-Y.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Digital Game Building: Learning In A Participatory Culture,"Background: The emergence of a participatory culture, brought about mainly by the use of Web2.0 technology, is challenging us to reconsider aspects of teaching and learning. Adapting the learning-as-digital-game-building approach, this paper explores how new educational practices can help students build skills for the 21st century. Purpose: This paper examines elementary students' learning experiences through digital game building and playing. The following research questions guided the study: (1) What emotions do students experience during the process of building digital games for others to use?; (2) What traits do students display when they learn through digital game-building?; and (3) What do students learn from the digital game-building experience? Sample: The participants were 21 elementary students (19 boys and two girls), aged between seven and 11, who were on a summer camp at a university in Canada. Design and methods: This small-scale study made use of enactivism (Li, Clark, and Winchester, Instructional design and technology grounded in enactivism: A paradigm shift?, British Journal of Educational Technology 41, no. 3: 403-419, 2010), a new theoretical framework, as a basis for analysing the students' experiences and responses as they created computer games to teach others the concept of Issac Newton's Three Laws of Motion. Quantitative and qualitative data collected included student and parent surveys, teacher and student interviews, field observations and the digital games created by the students. Data were subjected to quantitative and thematic analyses. Results: The results indicated that only a small minority of students reported never feeling the positive emotions excited/happy or smart/proud during the process of building digital games. In addition, analysis suggested that creativity, engagement and new identity were the three salient traits displayed by the students when learning by digital game-building. There was also evidence that students increased their understanding of the subject matter in question (mathematics, science and technology) and enhanced their general problem-solving abilities through the process. Conclusions: This small-scale study suggests that student engagement in the game-building experience can enhance not just the learning of the game design process but also subject matter and generic skills. Thus, the learning-as-building approach can empower students to 'take over the technology' and become creators rather than passive consumers. © 2010 NFER.",doi,10.1080/00131881.2010.524752,Scopus,Educational Research,Li Q.,2010,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Digital Posturography Games Correlate With Gross Motor Function In Children With Cerebral Palsy,"Objective: This pilot study aimed to assess whether performance on posturography games correlates with the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM) in children with cerebral palsy. Materials and Methods: Simple games using static posturography technology allowed subjects to control screen events via postural sway. Game performance was compared with GMFMs using correlation analysis in a convenience sample of nine girls and six boys with cerebral palsy. Likert scales were used to obtain subjective responses to the balance games. Results: GMFM scores correlated with game performance, especially measures emphasizing rhythmic sway. Twelve of the 15 subjects enjoyed the game and asserted an interest in playing again. Conclusions: Digital posturography games engage children with cerebral palsy in balance tasks, provide visual feedback in a balance control task, and have the potential to increase autonomy in balance control training among pediatric patients with cerebral palsy. This approach can support the relationship between child and therapist. The potential for interactive posturography to complement the assessment and treatment of balance in cerebral palsy bears continuing study. © Copyright 2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",doi,10.1089/g4h.2014.0096,Scopus,Games for Health Journal,"Bingham P.M., Calhoun B.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Distributed Bargaining In Dyadic-Exchange Networks,"This paper considers dyadic-exchange networks in which individual agents autonomously form coalitions of size two and agree on how to split a transferable utility. Valid results for this game include stable (if agents have no unilateral incentive to deviate), balanced (if matched agents obtain similar benefits from collaborating), or Nash (both stable and balanced) outcomes. We design provably correct continuous-time algorithms to find each of these classes of outcomes in a distributed way. Our algorithmic design to find Nash bargaining solutions builds on the other two algorithms by having the dynamics for finding stable outcomes feeding into the one for finding balanced ones. Our technical approach to establish convergence and robustness combines notions and tools from optimization, graph theory, nonsmooth analysis, and Lyapunov stability theory and provides a useful framework for further extensions. We illustrate our results in a wireless communication scenario where single-antenna devices have the possibility of working as 2-antenna virtual devices to improve channel capacity. © 2014 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TCNS.2015.2476215,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Control of Network Systems,"Richert D., Cortes J.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Do Laboratory Tests Of Blood Pressure Reactivity Predict Blood Pressure Changes During Everyday Life?,"This study was undertaken to examine whether blood pressure reactivity measured in the controlled setting of a laboratory could be correlated with blood pressure changes occurring during daily life. The subjects were 164 untreated hypertensives with mild hypertension, all of whom had a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure recording, during which their activities were unrestricted. One hundred thirteen performed a treadmill exercise test, and 51 performed two active coping tasks (playing a video game or mental arithmetic). Blood pressure was monitored at baseline and during the tasks. Significant correlations were observed between the absolute levels of pressure measured during the laboratory tests and ambulatory monitoring, but these were higher for the active coping tasks (r = 0.53 to 0.75) than the exercise testing (r = 0.26 to 0.46) and were no higher for pressures measured during the tasks than at baseline. Correlations between the changes of blood pressure during the laboratory tasks and the changes occurring during ambulatory monitoring were analyzed in three ways, using simple, multiple, and canonical correlations. In no case were these correlations substantively significant. Vie conclude that blood pressure reactivity measured in the laboratory may not be readily generalized to changes of pressure in everyday life, as measured by noninvasive ambulatory recorders.

,Does Emotional Arousal Influence Swearing Fluency?,"This study assessed the effect of experimentally manipulated emotional arousal on swearing fluency. We hypothesised that swear word generation would be increased with raised emotional arousal. The emotional arousal of 60 participants was manipulated by having them play a first-person shooter video game or, as a control, a golf video game, in a randomised order. A behavioural measure of swearing fluency based on the Controlled Oral Word Association Test was employed. Successful experimental manipulation was indicated by raised State Hostility Questionnaire scores after playing the shooter game. Swearing fluency was significantly greater after playing the shooter game compared with the golf game. Validity of the swearing fluency task was demonstrated via positive correlations with self-reported swearing fluency and daily swearing frequency. In certain instances swearing may represent a form of emotional expression. This finding will inform debates around the acceptability of using taboo language. © 2017, The Author(s).",doi,10.1007/s10936-016-9473-8,Scopus,Journal of Psycholinguistic Research,"Stephens R., Zile A.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Does Familiarity Affect The Enjoyment Of Touchscreen Games For People With Dementia?,"Introduction Previous research has indicated that people living with dementia are able to use touchscreen technology, which presents an opportunity to deliver meaningful and engaging activities for people to pass the time independently. The challenge is to identify suitable applications from the thousands that are currently available, and familiarity, where an app is a digital version of an existing real world game, may be one solution. Objectives To evaluate the concept of familiarity in gameplay with people living with dementia by comparing a known game with a novel game and measuring whether users are able to play these games independently and whether they enjoy doing so. Methods Thirty older adults living with dementia were recruited from local care services. Each participant was assigned to one of two groups. Group 1 played a familiar game (Solitaire) and Group 2 played a novel game (Bubble Xplode). Each participant played the same game on three separate occasions within one week. Number of gameplay attempts, whether a checkpoint was reached and how much time to reach the checkpoint were measured. A brief post-session interview was conducted to assess the participants’ enjoyment. Results Ninety percent of participants attempted gameplay independently with 17% of participants in the familiar group reaching the checkpoint compared with 93% playing the novel game. Regardless of which game was played or whether the checkpoint was reached, 88% of all participants reported enjoyment of the gaming sessions. Discussion People living with dementia can play touchscreen games independently, but familiarity does not ensure successful gameplay. Enjoyment appears to be independent of progression through a game. The potential of novel and unfamiliar games as meaningful activities that people with dementia can engage with independently should be further explored. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd",doi,10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2016.02.001,Scopus,International Journal of Medical Informatics,"Astell A.J., Joddrell P., Groenewoud H., de Lange J., Goumans M., Cordia A., Schikhof Y.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Does The Relationship Between Natriuretic Hormones And Diastolic Function Differ By Race?,"Introduction: Heart failure develops earlier and is more prevalent in blacks than whites because of their higher incidence of hypertension and diabetes and likely subsequent diastolic dysfunction. Natriuretic peptides (NP) prevent cardiac malfunction through pressure, natriuresis action. However, whether race affects the relationships of NP action with cardiac function is unknown. Methods: To assess this, 55 (21 whites and 27 males) normotensive adults underwent a 2-hour protocol of 40 minutes rest, video game stressor and recovery. Mitral inflow and myocardial velocities (tissue Doppler) were recorded every 20 minutes. Blood pressure and heart rate were obtained at 10-minute intervals. Blood samples for pro-atrial NP and pro-brain NP (pro-BNP) were collected every 40 minutes. Results: There were differences in the association between (1) the changes from rest to stress for E/A ratio and double product (whites, r = -0.42; blacks, r = 0. 10; P = 0.034 for difference between correlations); (2) stress E m and pro-atrial NP (whites, r = 0.59; blacks, r = -0.25; P = 0.025); (3) rest E m and BNP (whites, r = 0.83; blacks r = -0.17; P = 000); (4) rest E m/A m and pro-BNP (whites, r = 0.70; blacks, r = -0.42;; P = 0.003); (5) rest E/E m and pro-BNP (whites, r = -0.61; blacks, r = 0.31; P = 0.015) and (6) stress E and pro-BNP (whites, r = 0.56; blacks, r = -0.18; P = 0.043). Conclusion: The higher correlations between levels of NP and diastolic function indices both at rest and stress suggest that NP protective action is more pronounced in whites than in blacks. © 2012 Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins.",doi,10.1097/MAJ.0b013e31823673fd,Scopus,American Journal of the Medical Sciences,"Kapuku G.K., Davis H.C., Thomas P., Januzzi J., Harshfield G.A.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Dual-Circle Self-Localization For Soccer Robots With Omnidirectional Vision,"A self-localization method entitled dual-circle self-localization (DCSL) for mobile robots in a soccer robot game field is proposed in this article. To evaluate the performance of the proposed localization method, an omnidirectional vision device is installed on top of the robot to capture images for recognizing objects in the environment via a hybrid scanning method. Three reliable objects recognized are then chosen as landmarks to calculate the position of the robot in the game field via the proposed DCSL based on relative positions between the robot and landmarks in the omnidirectional images. Since only simple geometric manipulations are required for the DCSL algorithm, localization efficiency can be significantly improved while maintaining a relatively smaller mean error in comparison to Monte Carlo localization techniques as demonstrated in both simulation results and practical experiments in this article. © 2012 The Chinese Institute of Engineers.",doi,10.1080/02533839.2012.701835,Scopus,"Journal of the Chinese Institute of Engineers, Transactions of the Chinese Institute of Engineers,Series A/Chung-kuo Kung Ch'eng Hsuch K'an","Hsu C.-C., Wong C.-C., Teng H.-C., Ho C.-Y.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia

,Effect Of Divergent Self-Monitoring Strategies On Motor Performance And Emotion As A Function Of Alternating Task Complexity,"The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of implementing different self-monitoring (SM) strategies as a function of varying task complexity on a computer game, 'Shufflepuck'. Self-monitoring theory suggests that positive self-monitoring (PSM) results in better performance for difficult tasks, whereas negative self-monitoring (NSM) is preferable for easy tasks. When SM was tested under easy and complex task conditions, it was found that performance effectiveness was a function of matching appropriate task difficulty with the SM strategy. Unpaired t-tests compared the first set of 100 trials (pre-task) with the second set of 100 trials (post-task) on a computer skills game requiring hand-eye coordination. The results showed that subjects who changed from the difficult task/PSM condition to the easy task/PSM condition (different task, same SM strategy) performed significantly poorer (P < 0.001) than subjects who changed from the difficult task/PSM condition to the easy task/NSM condition (different task, different SM strategy). A second unpaired t-test comparing the two sets of difference performance scores indicated that performance was significantly superior for subjects using the PSM than the NSM strategy while performing the difficult task (P < 0.05). That is, changing from the easy task/NSM condition to the difficult task/NSM condition produced poorer performance than changing from the easy task/NSM to the difficult task/PSM condition. In terms of subjects' emotions, the use of NSM and PSM when performing easy and difficult tasks, respectively, resulted in markedly less negative affect (P < 0.01), but did not influence positive affect, on pre- and post-task comparisons. Finally, correlations between affect and performance, based on pre- and post-performance and affect scores, were moderate to high. Implications of the present results for slumps in sport performance are offered. © 1996 E. & F.N.

,"Effect Of Psychological Stress On The Salivary Cortisol And Amylase Levels In Healthy Young Adults. Archives Of Oral Biology, 49(12), 963–968.","OBJECTIVE: Saliva sampling has the advantage that it is non-invasive, making multiple sampling easy and stress free. We examined the effects of psychological stressor and soother on the salivary cortisol and amylase levels in young adults, and compared the characteristics of these parameters. DESIGN: The subjects completed the trait version of State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) to assess the predisposition to personal anxiety. The video of corneal transplant surgery was served as the stressor for 15 min. A scenic beauty video viewing was also used as the soother. Unstimulated whole saliva was collected every 3 min throughout the session. RESULTS: The amylase level was significantly increased just after the beginning of the stressful video viewing, and immediately returned to the pre-stress level just after the end of the video viewing. The cortisol level was also increased, but to a lesser extent compared with that of amylase. The latency time to the peak level for cortisol was longer than that of amylase. The carry-over effect was not observed in the amylase response but was in cortisol. Although the correlation between the amylase level and the STAI score was highly significant, cortisol level did not. In addition, soothing video viewing significantly decreased the amylase level, but did not affect the cortisol level. CONCLUSION: Salivary amylase level was more significantly increased and reacted more rapidly than cortisol by psychological stressor, suggesting that it is a better index of stress. Furthermore, it is suggested that the enzyme is a soothing or relaxation index.",doi,10.1016/j.archoralbio.2004.06.007,nagy2015,Archives of Oral Biology,"Takai, N., Yamaguchi, M., Aragaki, T., Eto, K., Uchihashi, K., Nishikawa, Y.",2004,NA,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Effectiveness And Feasibility Of Virtual Reality And Gaming System Use At Home By Older Adults For Enabling Physical Activity To Improve Health-Related Domains: A Systematic Review,"Background: use of virtual reality and commercial gaming systems (VR/gaming) at home by older adults is receiving attention as a means of enabling physical activity. Objective: to summarise evidence for the effectiveness and feasibility of VR/gaming system utilisation by older adults at home for enabling physical activity to improve impairments, activity limitations or participation. Methods: A systematic review searching 12 electronic databases from 1 January 2000-10 July 2012 using key search terms. Two independent reviewers screened yield articles using pre-determined selection criteria, extracted data using customised forms and applied the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool and the Downs and Black Checklist to rate study quality. Results: Fourteen studies investigating the effects of VR/gaming system use by healthy older adults and people with neurological conditions on activity limitations, body functions and physical impairments and cognitive and emotional well-being met the selection criteria. Study quality ratings were low and, therefore, evidence was not strong enough to conclude that interventions were effective. Feasibility was inconsistently reported in studies. Where feasibility was discussed, strong retention (≥70%) and adherence (≥64%) was reported. Initial assistance to use the technologies, and the need for monitoring exertion, aggravation of musculoskeletal symptoms and falls risk were reported. Conclusions: Existing evidence to support the feasibility and effectiveness VR/gaming systems use by older adults at home to enable physical activity to address impairments, activity limitations and participation is weak with a high risk of bias. The findings of this review may inform future, more rigorous research. © The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the British Geriatrics Society.

,Effects Of Computer Game On Responses In The Autonomic Nervous System In Children,"This study was designed to estimate the effect of computer game on responses in the autonomic nervous system in children by using power spectral analysis of heart rate (HR) variability. We used two different games that contained a battled, excited game (S) and a relieved, mild game (M). The results obtained were as follows: 1) HR in S during game tended to be higher than tnat in M. An index of sympathetic nervous system (SNS) during game was higher than during recovery in S, but showed an opposite change in M. Therefore, S might induce stress response during game while M might do it after game. 2) HR during individual mode in S tended to be higher than during mode in playing against other player. 3) HR, SNS and an index of parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) at 10th min. after game were similar to rest-level in both games. 4) There was positive, significant correlation between level of game master and PNS (y=0.09lx+4.lll, r=0.765, p<0.05). The results suggested that the responses in the autonomic nervous system in children during game were influenced by the type of game and the level of master. © 1995, The Japanese Association of Educational Psychology.

,Effects Of Cycling And Exergaming On Neurotrophic Factors In Elderly Type 2 Diabetic Men - A Preliminary Investigation,"Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are at increased risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases. There is growing evidence that repeated exercise-induced transient increases in neurotrophic factors can augment neurogenesis and neuroplasticity. This pilot study compares the effects of 30-min submaximal cycling with those of exergaming (combining exercise and video gaming) at the same duration and same rating of perceived exertion (BORG RPE: 14-15) on serum neurotrophic factors in 8 elderly non-insulin-dependent T2DM patients (71±4 years) (2×2 crossover design). Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 levels were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. Heart rates were almost equal during cycling and exergaming, while lactate values were significantly higher during cycling (cycling versus exergaming: 3.7±1.1 versus 2.5±1.2 mmol/l, p<0.05). BDNF and VEGF levels were increased significantly post-cycling (+20%,+14%, p<0.05). No other significant pre-post changes were evident. This study demonstrates that acute exercise can increase neurotrophic factors (BDNF, VEGF) in elderly T2DM patients, depending on exercise mode. © J. A.

,Effects Of Emotion Recognition Training On Mood Among Individuals With High Levels Of Depressive Symptoms: Study Protocol For A Randomised Controlled Trial,"Background: We have developed a new paradigm that targets the recognition of facial expression of emotions. Here we report the protocol of a randomised controlled trial of the effects of emotion recognition training on mood in a sample of individuals with depressive symptoms over a 6-week follow-up period.Methods/Design: We will recruit 190 adults from the general population who report high levels of depressive symptoms (defined as a score ≥ 14 on the Beck Depression Inventory-II). Participants will attend a screening session and will be randomised to intervention or control procedures, repeated five times over consecutive days (Monday to Friday). A follow-up session will take place at end-of -treatment, 2-weeks and 6-weeks after training. Our primary study outcome will be depressive symptoms, Beck Depression Inventory- II (rated over the past two weeks). Our secondary outcomes are: depressive symptoms, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression; anxiety symptoms, Beck Anxiety Inventory (rated over the past month); positive affect, Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (rated as 'how you feel right now'); negative affect, Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (rated as 'how you feel right now'); emotion sensitivity, Emotion Recognition Task (test phase); approach motivation and persistence, the Fishing Game; and depressive interpretation bias, Scrambled Sentences Test.Discussion: This study is of a novel cognitive bias modification technique that targets biases in emotional processing characteristic of depression, and can be delivered automatically via computer, Internet or Smartphone. It therefore has potential to be a valuable cost-effective adjunctive treatment for depression which may be used together with more traditional psychotherapy, cognitive-behavioural therapy and pharmacotherapy.Trial registration: Current Controlled Trials: ISRCTN17767674. © 2013 Adams et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",doi,10.1186/1745-6215-14-161,Scopus,Trials,"Adams S., Penton-Voak I.S., Harmer C.J., Holmes E.A., Munafò M.R.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Effects Of Exergaming On Physical Activity In Overweight Individuals.,"The majority of patients with overweight and type 2 diabetes show insufficient levels of daily physical activity (PA) and usually are among the least likely to engage in or adhere to any form of generic PA. Active video games (exergames) may be a solution to motivate these individuals to overcome their sedentary lifestyle. This systematic review was conducted to review the current evidence for the effectiveness of exergaming in overweight and type 2 diabetes mellitus and thus to evaluate the suitability of these games to be used as tools for exercise promotion that meet current PA guidelines. We searched electronic bibliographic databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, OpenGrey, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) up to March 2015. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) and cross-sectional studies published in English in a peer-reviewed journal and analyzing the effects of exergames on objectively measured intensity parameters of PA in overweight (body mass index [BMI] ≥25 kg/m(2)) adults (mean age ≥18 years) with and without type 2 diabetes were included. Study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment were performed independently by two review authors. Primary outcomes included changes in oxygen uptake (VO2), energy expenditure (EE), heart rate (HR), or activity counts. Secondary outcomes were enjoyment of treatment, exercise adherence, ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), changes in body composition, and changes in blood parameters (serum glucose, long-term blood glucose, blood cholesterol, triglycerides, or serum lactate). Of 2845 records, 14 publications (11 studies) met the inclusion criteria. All included studies (ten experimental, cross-sectional laboratory studies and one RCT) were able to show increases in either VO2, EE, HR, or activity counts. However, effects of exergaming in terms of changes in these intensity parameters varied significantly between game modes and consoles as well as because of the vastly differing durations of exergame activity between studies. One of the included studies had a low risk of bias, and three had a high risk of bias; seven studies had an unclear risk of bias as the study description was insufficient. No studies were found investigating the changes in objectively measured PA intensity parameters in patients with type 2 diabetes. This review suggests that exergames are able to increase PA among overweight individuals. However, the inconsistent results and the overall poor or moderate methodological quality do not permit judgment on whether exergames are suitable to meet PA guidelines in this target group. The lack of research regarding the effects of exergames in type 2 diabetes indicates a great need for future research.",doi,10.1007/s40279-015-0455-z,pubmed,"Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)","Höchsmann, Christoph; Schüpbach, Michael; Schmidt-Trucksäss, Arno",2017,NA,NA,reviewer2,Lydia

High aerobic intensity training (HIT) improve peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak), net mechanical efficiency of walking and risk factors for CVD but has not been investigated in patients with schizophrenia. Aims: To investigate effects from HIT on VO2peak, net mechanical efficiency of walking and risk factors for CVD in patients with schizophrenia. Methods: 25 inpatients (F2029, ICD-10) were allocated to either HIT or playing computer games (CG), 3 days per week for 8 weeks. HIT consisted of 4 × - 4-min intervals with 3-min break periods, at 8595% and 70% of peak heart rate, respectively. Results: 12 and seven patients completed HIT and CG, respectively. The baseline VO2peak in both groups combined (n = 19) was 36.8 ± 8.2 ml/kg/min and 3.12 ± 0.55 l/min. The HIT group improved VO2peak by 12% from 3.17 ± 0.59 to 3.56 ± 0.68 l/min (P < 0.001), more than the CG group (P = 0.014). Net mechanical efficiency of walking improved by 12% in the HIT group from 19.8 ± 3.0% to 22.2 ± 4.5% (P = 0.005), more than the CG group (P = 0.031). The psychiatric symptoms, expressed as the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS), did not improve in either group. Conclusions: VO2peak and net mechanical efficiency of walking improved significantly by 8 weeks of HIT. HIT should be included in rehabilitation in order to improve physical capacity and contribute risk reduction of CVD. © 2011 Informa Healthcare.",doi,10.3109/08039488.2011.560278,Scopus,Nordic Journal of Psychiatry,"Heggelund J., Nilsberg G.E., Hoff J., Morken G., Helgerud J.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Effects Of Nos3 Glu298asp Polymorphism On Hemodynamic Reactivity To Stress: Influences Of Ethnicity And Obesity,"Studies on the associations between the nitric oxide synthase gene (NOS3) Glu298Asp polymorphism and hypertension status or blood pressure (BP) levels have had inconsistent results. Potential moderating influences of ethnicity, sex, and obesity on the effects of the NOS3 polymorphism have not been examined. We evaluated the influence of these factors on associations between the NOS3 polymorphism, nitric oxide metabolites (NOx), and hemodynamics at rest and during stress. Subjects were 235 African American (AA) and 262 European American (EA) young adults (18.5±2.6 years). Hemodynamic measurements and blood samples for NOx assays were taken before and after a competitive video game challenge. Glu298Asp polymorphism was detected by polymerase chain reaction-restriction enzyme digestion assay. A regression model was built using genotypes, ethnicity, sex, and obesity (body mass index >85th percentile) and their interactions controlling for age; 20.1% of AAs and 49.8% of EAs were carriers of the Asp allele. AAs, regardless of obesity status, exhibited high diastolic blood pressure (DBP) reactivity unless they were nonobese and noncarriers of the Asp allele. EAs exhibited lower DBP reactivity unless they were obese Asp allele carriers. AA nonobese carriers exhibited the greatest total peripheral resistance reactivity. Obese Asp allele carriers exhibited the greatest increases in cardiac output and the greatest decrease in NOx to the stressor. Results indicate the importance of examining impact of BP control-related genetic polymorphisms within the context of moderating factors such as adiposity and ethnicity.",doi,10.1161/01.HYP.0000147578.84729.ac,Scopus,Hypertension,"Malhotra S., Poole J., Davis H., Dong Y., Pollock J., Snieder H., Treiber F.",2004,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Effects Of Outcome On The Covariance Between Risk Level And Brain Activity In Adolescents With Internet Gaming Disorder,"Individuals with internet gaming disorder (IGD) often have impaired risky decision-making abilities, and IGD-related functional changes have been observed during neuroimaging studies of decision-making tasks. However, it is still unclear how feedback (outcomes of decision-making) affects the subsequent risky decision-making in individuals with IGD. In this study, twenty-four adolescents with IGD and 24 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited and underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing the balloon analog risk task (BART) to evaluate the effects of prior outcomes on brain activity during subsequent risky decision-making in adolescents with IGD. The covariance between risk level and activation of the bilateral ventral medial prefrontal cortex, left inferior frontal cortex, right ventral striatum (VS), left hippocampus/parahippocampus, right inferior occipital gyrus/fusiform gyrus and right inferior temporal gyrus demonstrated interaction effects of group by outcome (P < 0.05, AlphaSim correction). The regions with interactive effects were defined as ROI, and ROI-based intergroup comparisons showed that the covariance between risk level and brain activation was significantly greater in adolescents with IGD compared with HCs after a negative outcome occurred (P < 0.05). Our results indicated that negative outcomes affected the covariance between risk level and activation of the brain regions related to value estimation (prefrontal cortex), anticipation of rewards (VS), and emotional-related learning (hippocampus/parahippocampus), which may be one of the underlying neural mechanisms of disadvantageous risky decision-making in adolescents with IGD. © 2016 The Authors",doi,10.1016/j.nicl.2016.10.024,Scopus,NeuroImage: Clinical,"Qi X., Yang Y., Dai S., Gao P., Du X., Zhang Y., Du G., Li X., Zhang Q.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Effects Of Pain And Audiovisual Stimulation On The Opioid-Induced Depression Of The Hypoxic Ventilatory Response,"Background: Normoxic and hypoxic ventilation are influenced by chemoreceptor and nonchemoreceptor drives. Although inhalational anesthetics blunt hypoxic ventilation, this effect is reversed by audiovisual stimulation but not by pain. Opioids reduce both normoxic and hypoxic ventilation, but their interaction with pain and audiovisual stimulation has not been fully reported. Methods: Isocapnic, acute hypoxic ventilatory responses (AHRs) were measured in 11 volunteers. AHR and normoxic ventilation were measured under the following conditions: (1) eyes closed, no audio stimulation (low wakefulness); (2) low wakefulness conditions plus painful thermal stimulation; and (3) playing a computer game (high wakefulness), each with and without remifentanil infusion. Results: The average (± SD) remifentanil dose was 0.035 ± 0.012 μg · kg-1 · min-1. Both normoxic and hypoxic ventilation were significantly reduced by the remifentanil infusion under all three conditions. The AHR values under low wakefulness conditions were 0.33 ± 0.19 and 0.89 ± 0.49 1 · min-1 · sat-1 with and without remifentanil, respectively (P &lt; 0.05). High wakefulness significantly increased AHR with and without remifentanil, whereas low wakefulness with pain did not. However, high wakefulness with remifentanil did not increase the AHR back to what was observed during low wakefulness without remifentanil. Conclusions: The computer game was a more potent stimulus than pain in countering the depressant effect of remifentanil on AHR. Although the effect of high wakefulness was more attenuated than was previously observed with respect to inhalational anesthetics, the significance of these findings is underlined by the more clinically relevant scenario of what is experienced in the face of opioid administration. © 2005 American Society of Anesthesiologists, Inc.

,"Effects Of Playing A Computer Game Using A Bright Display On Presleep Physiological Variables, Sleep Latency, Slow Wave Sleep And Rem Sleep","Epidemiological studies have shown that playing a computer game at night delays bedtime and shortens sleeping hours, but the effects on sleep architecture and quality have remained unclear. In the present study, the effects of playing a computer game and using a bright display on nocturnal sleep were examined in a laboratory. Seven male adults (24.7 ± 5.6 years old) played exciting computer games with a bright display (game-BD) and a dark display (game-DD) and performed simple tasks with low mental load as a control condition in front of a BD (control-BD) and DD (control-DD) between 23:00 and 1:45 hours in randomized order and then went to bed at 2:00 hours and slept until 8:00 hours. Rectal temperature, electroencephalogram (EEG), heart rate and subjective sleepiness were recorded before sleep and a polysomnogram was recorded during sleep. Heart rate was significantly higher after playing games than after the control conditions, and it was also significantly higher after using the BD than after using the DD. Subjective sleepiness and relative theta power of EEG were significantly lower after playing games than after the control conditions. Sleep latency was significantly longer after playing games than after the control conditions. REM sleep was significantly shorter after the playing games than after the control conditions. No significant effects of either computer games or BD were found on slow-wave sleep. These results suggest that playing an exciting computer game affects sleep latency and REM sleep but that a bright display does not affect sleep variables. © 2005 European Sleep Research Society.",doi,10.1111/j.1365-2869.2005.00463.x,Scopus,Journal of Sleep Research,"Higuchi S., Motohashi Y., Liu Y., Maeda A.",2005,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,"Effects Of Songs With Prosocial Lyrics On Prosocial Thoughts, Affect, And Behavior","Previous research has shown that exposure to violent media increased aggression-related affect and thoughts, physiological arousal, and aggressive behavior as well as decreased prosocial tendencies. The present research examined the hypothesis that exposure to prosocial media promotes prosocial outcomes. Three studies revealed that listening to songs with prosocial (relative to neutral) lyrics increased the accessibility of prosocial thoughts, led to more interpersonal empathy, and fostered helping behavior. These results provide first evidence for the predictive validity of the General Learning Model [Buckley, K. E., & Anderson, C. A. (2006).

,Effects Of Violent Video Games On Aggressive Behavior: Potential Sex Differences.,"Evidence of the effects of playing violent video games on subsequent aggression has been mixed. This study examined how playing a violent video game affected levels of aggression displayed in a laboratory. A total of 43 undergraduate students (22 men and 21 women) were randomly assigned to play either a violent (Mortal Kombat) or nonviolent (PGA Tournament Golf) video game for 10 min. Then they competed with a confederate in a reaction time task that allowed for provocation and retaliation. Punishment levels set by participants for their opponents served as the measure of aggression. The results confirmed our hypothesis that playing the violent game would result in more aggression than would playing the nonviolent game. In addition, a Game × Sex interaction showed that this effect was larger for men than for women. Findings are discussed in light of potential differences in aggressive style between men and women.",doi,10.1006/jesp.2001.1502,anderson2010,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,"Bartholow, B.

,Emotion Regulation And Its Effects On Mood Improvement In Response To An In Vivo Peer Rejection Challenge,"This study examined children's spontaneous use of behavioral emotion regulation (ER) strategies and their effects on subsequent mood change in response to an in vivo peer rejection manipulation. Participants (N = 186), ranging between 10 and 13 years of age, played a computer game based on the television show Survivor and were randomized to either peer rejection (being voted out of the game) or nonrejection control. In response to rejection, more than one third of the participants (38%) displayed a marked worsening (i.e., reliable change) in state mood. After receiving feedback, time spent on several behavioral ER strategies during a 5-minute postfeedback period was assessed. At the end of the postfeedback period, children's cognitive activity was also assessed. More time spent on behavioral distraction was positively linked to subsequent increases in positive affect, whereas the reverse pattern was found for disengagement/passive behavior. Moreover, higher endorsement ratings for the strategy of ""cognitive analysis"" were associated with stronger increases in negative affect. © 2006 APA, all rights reserved.",doi,10.1037/1528-3542.6.4.543,Scopus,Emotion,"Reijntjes A., Stegge H., Terwogt M.M., Kamphuis J.H., Telch M.J.",2006,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Emotional Conflict In Interpersonal Interactions,"Facial displays of emotions can help to infer the mental states of other individuals. However, the expectations we generate on the basis of people's emotions can mismatch their actual behaviour in certain circumstances, which generates conflict. In the present study, we explored the neural mechanisms of emotional conflict during interpersonal interactions. Participants had to accept or reject economic offers made by several partners who displayed emotional expressions. On every trial, a cue informed participants of whether they could trust the emotion of their partner or not. Trustworthy (low-conflict) partners with happy facial expressions were cooperative and those with angry expressions did not cooperate. Untrustworthy (high-conflict) partners, on the other hand, cooperated when their expression was angry and did not cooperate when they displayed a happy emotion. Behavioural responses were faster for trustworthy than for untrustworty partners. High-conflict partners activated the anterior cingulate and the anterior insula. In turn, trustworthy partners were associated with activations in the left precuneus. Our results suggest that the emotion displayed by another person affects our decision-making in social contexts. When emotional expressions are linked to their natural consequences, they engage ToM processes. In contrast, untrustworthy emotional expressions engage conflict-related brain regions. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.",doi,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.08.039,Scopus,NeuroImage,"Ruz M., Tudela P.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Emotional Journeys In Game Design Teams,"There is little research into the emotional dimension of creative industry personnel, such as computer game designers, and how emotions relate to their creative practices and work-related events. Such socioemotional work is the focus of this chapter. There is a practice-centered relevance to this topic too - it is reported that there exists a poor quality of life in many global game studios. Given our deficient knowledge of emotions in computer game development, and the practical resonance of this topic, our key research question is: What emotions, creative practices and work-related events characterize emotional journeys in computer game design teams, and how do these characteristics inter-relate? To explore and answer this research question, we draw on an in-depth field study of a computer games studio in Singapore. The chapter offers a theory of emotion-mediated improvisation as a coping model for the tumultuous emotional journeys that game developers endure. © 2011, IGI Global.",doi,10.4018/978-1-60960-567-4.ch014,Scopus,"Business, Technological, and Social Dimensions of Computer Games: Multidisciplinary Developments","Stacey P., Nandhakumar J.",2011,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Emotional Mapping Of The Archaeologist Game,"Mobile and ubiquitous learning has been linked to new information and communication technologies embedded in everyday life objects. A variety of invisible embedded tools have been developed and are connected to the Internet. The boundaries between learning, gaming, simulating or role-playing are not clearly defined. In this context a visit to a museum or to another place of interest (e.g. Archaeological parks, historical towns, urban trekking, etc.) using a smartphone, or a tablet, may offer a unique educational experience as will be described in the didactic experiments of EMMAP (Emotional Mapping of Museum Augmented Places) at the Archaeological Museum ""Giuseppe Moretti"" of San Severino Marche (Italy). EMMAP is a format aimed to develop innovative pedagogies, using handheld technology combined with QR codes, broadcasting and augmented reality (AR). These tools are useful in creating a ubiquitous learning environment and involving participants emotionally in a real landscape.

,Emotional Response Of Internet Gaming Disorder Gamer Among Taiwan College Students,"National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan Internet is fast developed and widely used in the world. People use internet for variety purposes, and over one billion users played computer games, but some of them addicted to internet or online game which was called Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD). IGD was defined and suggested investigating through standard criteria proposed by DSM-5. The symptoms of IGD include preoccupation with online activity, withdrawal, tolerance, and escape or relief from a negative mood. Some studies and scales considered that emotion was one feature or assessment of internet addiction (IA). Emotion brings psychological and physiological information of IGD. This study aimed to investigate emotional responses of IGD. Fifty college subjects in Taiwan were recruited and participated in an emotional induced experiment. IGD gamers reported different emotional intensity and expressed different autonomic nervous activity (from HRV) than non-IGD gamers when watching online game films. The emotional feature of IGD is worthy to be further studied to assist the development of research and applications. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.",doi,10.1166/asl.2017.9012,Scopus,Advanced Science Letters,"Hsieh D.-L., Hsiao T.-C.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Energy Expenditure And Affect Responses To Different Types Of Active Video Game And Exercise,"Background: The purpose of this study was to compare entertainment-themed active video game (AVG) and fitness-themed AVG play with traditional exercise to examine the interaction between physiological and psychological responses. Methods: Participants (N = 23) were randomly assigned to 30-min of (i) self-selected intensity exercise (SS-EX), (ii) moderate intensity exercise (MOD-EX), (iii) entertainment-themed video game (ET-VG) and (iv) fitness-themed video game (FT-VG). Physiological and psychological outcomes were recorded before, during and after each trial. Results: All trials met the ACSM criteria for moderate or vigorous physical activity. The % VO2R (68.3±13.9%) and rate of energy expenditure (10.3±3.1kcal/min) was significantly higher in the SS-EX trial with lowest values reported for ET-VG (p&lt;0.05). No differences were found in % heart rate reserve between SS-EX and FT-VG (66.9±12.5% and 67.1 ±6% respectively). The AVG's were significantly more enjoyable than the exercise trials (p&lt;0.05) and the ET-VG resulted in the highest core flow and psychological well-being (p&lt;0.05). Conclusion: AVG's can elicit physiological responses that meet recommended exercise intensities but are more enjoyable than conventional exercise in young inactive adults. While further work is required, this study highlights the importance of examining the interaction between physiological outcomes and psychological states to increase physical activity and reduce sedentary time. © 2017 Monedero et al.

,Entertaining Media Use And The Satisfaction Of Recovery Needs: Recovery Outcomes Associated With The Use Of Interactive And Noninteractive Entertaining Media,"Recent research has linked the enjoyment of entertaining media to the satisfaction of intrinsic human needs (Tamborini, Bowman, Eden, Grizzard, & Organ, 2010; Tamborini, Grizzard, et al., in press). The present investigation addressed the satisfaction of recovery needs through the use of interactive and noninteractive entertaining media stimuli and the resulting recovery outcomes. In an experiment (N = 160), participants were first exposed to a working task to elicit the need for recovery and then randomly assigned to one of four experimental conditions: 1) a video game, 2) a video recording of a game, 3) an animated video clip, or 4) the control condition. The results demonstrate that interactive and noninteractive media stimuli elicit different patterns of recovery experience. Furthermore, recovery experience was significantly related to enjoyment as well as subjective (energetic arousal) and objective (cognitive performance) recovery outcomes. Enjoyment mediated the relationship between recovery experience and energetic arousal. The results demonstrate that the effects of need satisfaction associated with the use of entertaining media go beyond enjoyment and may affect recovery and psychological well being. The findings are discussed in terms of their implications for research on the recovery effects of entertaining media and for current needs-based approaches to media enjoyment. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",doi,10.1080/15213269.2011.573466,Scopus,Media Psychology,"Reinecke L., Klatt J., Krämer N.C.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Epidemiological Aspects Of Self-Reported Sleep Onset Latency In Japanese Junior High School Children,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationships between sleep onset latency (SOL) and other sleep-wake patterns and media use habits in Japanese schoolchildren. A total of 9718 junior high school children responded (12.8 years) and 9199 questionnaires were used in the present analyses. The questionnaire assessed sleep-wake patterns, TV viewing and videogame habits. Overall, 72.1% of the subjects reported short SOL (≤20 min). Long SOL subjects (>20 min) were strongly associated with disturbed sleep manifested especially by increased risk of night awakenings, decreased sleep depth, and bad sleep in general (overall sleep quality). Prolonged SOL was also associated with daytime sleepiness, difficulties in falling asleep, bad morning feeling and sleep insufficiency. We found a U-shaped relationship between sleep period and SOL. Increase in bedtime was accompanied by increased risk of prolonged SOL. The impact of ultra-short and ultra-long SOL (≤5 and ≥40 min) was also analysed. Long durations of watching television and playing videogame were significantly associated with prolonged SOL. After adjustment for sex, girls presented significantly higher risk of prolonged SOL. Body mass index adjustment did not reveal any significant results. SOL presents a significant component of sleep-wake habits; poor sleep hygiene and insufficient sleep time significantly increase SOL. Parents, healthcare practitioners and children themselves should be aware of the potentially negative influence of prolonged SOL. Additionally, the optimal coherent sleep-wake schedule must be promoted in parallel with the limitation on the viewing TV and game practices. © 2006 European Sleep Research Society.",doi,10.1111/j.1365-2869.2006.00530.x,Scopus,Journal of Sleep Research,"Alexandru G., Michikazu S., Shimako H., Xiaoli C., Hitomi K., Takashi Y., Robert W.W., Sadanobu K.",2006,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Evaluating Player Task Engagement And Arousal Using Electroencephalography,"Advances in affective computing technologies have made it possible for researchers to investigate brain function while users interact in virtual environments. Progress in sensors and algorithms for off-the-shelf EEG systems has made it possible for gaming researchers to perform real-time estimation of human cognitive and affective states using EEG. In this study our aim was to coordinate “Task Engagement” data with “Arousal-Valence” data. The resulting coordinate was designed for application to expressive transformations to video game play in real time by tuning different performance parameters in an Engagement-Arousal rule system. Results revealed that the engagement index (Beta / (Alpha + Theta)) was capable of differentiating high intensity game events (Player Death) from general game play. Given that higher levels of engagement during death events may reflect increase in autonomic response, we also measured arousal by using (BetaF3 + BetaF4) / (AlphaF3 + AlphaF4) and valence using (AlphaF4 / BetaF4) - (AlphaF3 / BetaF3). Results revealed that arousal increases and valence decreases during high intensity game events (Player Death) when compared to lower intensity game events (General Game Play). Given our desire to establish “Task Engagement” data with “Arousal-Valence” coordinates for a flow model, we divided the data into quartiles, which allowed us to establish upper and lower thresholds to indicate when the player has left a state of flow. Our aim was to use an off-the-shelf EEG system to establish “Task Engagement” and “Arousal-Valence” coordinates during video game play that can be used for a flow model. It is believed that this model will allow for future use of the Emotiv for assessing the cognitive and emotional processing of the player. © 2015 The Authors",doi,10.1016/j.promfg.2015.07.376,Scopus,Procedia Manufacturing,"McMahan T., Parberry I., Parsons T.D.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Evaluation Method Of Visual Induced Motion Sickness By Interactive Video Using Time-Variant Biosignals,"Objective evaluation methods of visual induced motion sickness (VIMS) caused by interactive video such as computer game is studied to clarify the relation between VIMS and image motion components. We focus on time-variant biosignal indices related autonomic nervous activity, and estimate availability of two indices called ∆ILF/HF based on LF/HF ratio and triggerpoints from heart rate signals. As a result of experiment by 20 subjects, the biosignal indices have positive correlation with the global motion of video in case of non-interactive video, whether unpleasant subjective score is low or high. In case of interactive video, on the other hand, both subjective score and triggerpoints by biosignal decrease compare to that of non-interactive video, and ∆ILF/HF indices tendency depends on the operation type of video in case of interactive video. These results suggest that triggerpoints indices are possible to use for evaluation of VIMS related by GMV, and ∆ILF/HF indices are possible to use unconscious VIMS effect in ANA level caused by video motion and operation rather than subjective unpleasant sensation. © 2011, The Institute of Image Electronics Engineers of Japan.

,Evaluation Of The Energy Cost Of Playing A Dance Simulation Video Game In Overweight And Non-Overweight Children And Adolescents,"The purpose of this study was to determine if there were any differences in the submaximal energy cost of movement between overweight (OW) and non-overweight (NO) children while playing a dance simulation video game, Dance Dance Revolution (DDR) and to determine if the cardiorespiratory measures obtained while playing the game met the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) recommendations for developing and maintaining cardiorespiratory fitness. Twenty-two children and adolescents (10 OW vs. 12 NO) participated in the study. Cardiorespiratory measurements were taken both during a maximal treadmill walking test and during a 12-minute Dance Dance Revolution protocol. The average absolute V̇O2 (OW: 917.1 ± 257.1 vs. 590.6 ± 147.9 mL·min-1) sustained over the DDR protocol was significantly higher in the OW group compared to the NO group. There was no significant difference in the average energy cost of movement when V̇O 2 was normalized to fat-free mass (OW: 17.7 ± 5.1 vs. NO: 17.3 ± 3.9 mL·kgFFM-1·min-1). Both groups were above the minimal ACSM recommended heart rate intensity for developing and maintaining cardiorespiratory fitness when participating in the DDR protocol (OW: 64.83% ± 7.14 vs. NO: 64.51% ± 7.71), V·O2 reserve, however, did not meet ACSM standards for developing and maintaining cardiorespiratory fitness. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG.",doi,10.1055/s-2005-872964,Scopus,International Journal of Sports Medicine,"Unnithan V.B., Houser W., Fernhall B.",2006,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Evolutionary Game Theory-Based Collaborative Sensing Model In Emergency Crahns,"Game theory has been a tool of choice for modeling dynamic interactions between autonomous systems. Cognitive radio ad hoc networks (CRAHNs) constituted of autonomous wireless nodes are a natural fit for game theory-based modeling. The game theory-based model is particularly suitable for ""collaborative spectrum sensing"" where each cognitive radio senses the spectrum and shares the results with other nodes such that the targeted sensing accuracy is achieved. Spectrum sensing in CRAHNs, especially when used in emergency scenarios such as disaster management and military applications, needs to be not only accurate and resource efficient, but also adaptive to the changing number of users as well as signal-to-noise ratios. In addition, spectrum sensing mechanism must also be proactive, fair, and tolerant to security attacks. Existing work in collaborative spectrum sensing has mostly been confined to resource efficiency in static systems using request-based reactive sensing resulting in high latencies. In this paper, evolutionary game theory (EGT) is used to model the behavior of the emergency CRAHNS, providing an efficient model for collaborative spectrum sensing. The resulting implementation model is adaptive to the changes in its environment such as signal-to-noise ratio and number of users in the network. The analytical and simulation models presented validate the system design and the desired performance.

,Exergames For Older Adults With Subthreshold Depression: Does Higher Playfulness Lead To Better Improvement In Depression?,"Objective: The use of exergames is increasingly prevalent in the healthcare promotion among older adults. The current study aimed to examine whether the playfulness may influence the antidepressant effect of exergames on older adults. Method: Two experimental conditions, high playfulness (Wii™ Sport games) and low playfulness (Wii Fit™ training), were implemented in a 6-week randomized controlled study. A manipulation check was conducted first to confirm the significant difference in playfulness between the two conditions. A total of 49 community-dwelling older adults diagnosed with subthreshold depression have finished the study. Their depression, positive emotions, and self-efficacy were measured at both pre- and post-test. A multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) was then conducted between two conditions, with age and gender as the covariates. Results: Findings suggest that older adults in both two exergame conditions have improvements in subthreshold depression [t(48) = 9.48, P < 0.001], positive emotions [t(48) = -12.04, P < 0.001], and self-efficacy [t(48) = -9.78, P < 0.001]. Significant effect of playfulness in exergames was found on positive emotions among older adults [F(3, 47) = 20.82, P < 0.001], although not on subthreshold depression and self-efficacy. Conclusion: Results gained from the study will assist in the future implementation and development of exergames that aim to improve mental health among older adults. © Copyright 2016, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016.",doi,10.1089/g4h.2015.0100,Scopus,Games for Health Journal,"Li J., Theng Y.-L., Foo S.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Experience Assessment And Design In The Analysis Of Gameplay,"We report research on player modeling using psychophysiology and machine learning, conducted through interdisciplinary collaboration between researchers of computer science, psychology, and game design at Aalto University, Helsinki. First, we propose the Play Patterns And eXperience (PPAX) framework to connect three levels of game experience that previously had remained largely unconnected: game design patterns, the interplay of game context with player personality or tendencies, and state-of-the-art measures of experience (both subjective and non-subjective). Second, we describe our methodology for using machine learning to categorize game events to reveal corresponding patterns, culminating in an example experiment.

,Exploring The Neural Basis Of Avatar Identification In Pathological Internet Gamers And Of Self-Reflection In Pathological Social Network Users,"Background and aims: Internet gaming addiction appears to be related to self-concept deficits and increased angular gyrus (AG)-related identification with one's avatar. For increased social network use, a few existing studies suggest striatal-related positive social feedback as an underlying factor. However, whether an impaired self-concept and its reward-based compensation through the online presentation of an idealized version of the self are related to pathological social network use has not been investigated yet. We aimed to compare different stages of pathological Internet game and social network use to explore the neural basis of avatar and self-identification in addictive use. Methods: About 19 pathological Internet gamers, 19 pathological social network users, and 19 healthy controls underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while completing a self-retrieval paradigm, asking participants to rate the degree to which various self-concept-related characteristics described their self, ideal, and avatar. Self-conceptrelated characteristics were also psychometrically assessed. Results: Psychometric testing indicated that pathological Internet gamers exhibited higher self-concept deficits generally, whereas pathological social network users exhibit deficits in emotion regulation only. We observed left AG hyperactivations in Internet gamers during avatar reflection and a correlation with symptom severity. Striatal hypoactivations during self-reflection (vs. ideal reflection) were observed in social network users and were correlated with symptom severity. Discussion and conclusion: Internet gaming addiction appears to be linked to increased identification with one's avatar, evidenced by high left AG activations in pathological Internet gamers. Addiction to social networks seems to be characterized by emotion regulation deficits, reflected by reduced striatal activation during self-reflection compared to during ideal reflection. © 2016 The Author(s).",doi,10.1556/2006.5.2016.048,Scopus,Journal of Behavioral Addictions,"Leménager T., Dieter J., Hill H., Hoffmann S., Reinhard I., Beutel M., Vollstädt-Klein S., Kiefer F., Mann K.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Facing The Challenge Of Teaching Emotions To Individuals With Low- And High-Functioning Autism Using A New Serious Game: A Pilot Study,"Background: It is widely accepted that emotion processing difficulties are involved in Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC). An increasing number of studies have focused on the development of training programs and have shown promising results. However, most of these programs are appropriate for individuals with high-functioning ASC (HFA) but exclude individuals with low-functioning ASC (LFA). We have developed a computer-based game called JeStiMulE based on logical skills to teach emotions to individuals with ASC, independently of their age, intellectual, verbal and academic level.The aim of the present study was to verify the usability of JeStiMulE (which is its adaptability, effectiveness and efficiency) on a heterogeneous ASC group. We hypothesized that after JeStiMulE training, a performance improvement would be found in emotion recognition tasks. Methods. A heterogeneous group of thirty-three children and adolescents with ASC received two one-hour JeStiMulE sessions per week over four weeks. In order to verify the usability of JeStiMulE, game data were collected for each participant. Furthermore, all participants were presented before and after training with five emotion recognition tasks, two including pictures of game avatars (faces and gestures) and three including pictures of real-life characters (faces, gestures and social scenes). Results: Descriptive data showed suitable adaptability, effectiveness and efficiency of JeStiMulE. Results revealed a significant main effect of Session on avatars (ANOVA: F (1,32) = 98.48, P <.001) and on pictures of real-life characters (ANOVA: F (1,32) = 49.09, P <.001). A significant Session × Task × Emotion interaction was also found for avatars (ANOVA: F (6,192) = 2.84, P =.01). This triple interaction was close to significance for pictures of real-life characters (ANOVA: F (12,384) = 1.73, P =.057). Post-hoc analyses revealed that 30 out of 35 conditions found a significant increase after training. Conclusions: JeStiMulE appears to be a promising tool to teach emotion recognition not only to individuals with HFA but also those with LFA. JeStiMulE is thus based on ASC-specific skills, offering a model of logical processing of social information to compensate for difficulties with intuitive social processing. Trial registration.

,"Fight Fire With Rainbows: The Effects Of Displayed Violence, Difficulty, And Performance In Digital Games On Affect, Aggression, And Physiological Arousal","There is a large amount of variables that need to be taken into account when studying the effects of violent content in digital games; one of those being difficulty. In the current study participants played a modified first-person shooter in one of four different conditions, with either high or low difficulty and high or low violent game content. We assessed number of kills and number of deaths as game performance. Neither the difficulty nor the displayed violence had an effect on psychophysiological arousal during play, post-game aggressive cognitions, nor aggressive behavior. Thus, this study corroborates previous research indicating that violence in games does not substantially influence human behavior or experience, and other game characteristics deserve more attention in game effects studies. In addition, findings showed that challenge manipulated by game difficulty is of main importance for post-game emotions: Number of deaths predicted positive affect, but only in the low difficulty condition while number of kills was a positive predictor for positive affect and a negative predictor for negative affect. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

,Fmri-Activation Patterns In The Detection Of Concealed Information Rely On Memory-Related Effects,"Recent research on potential applications of fMRI in the detection of concealed knowledge primarily ascribed the reported differences in hemodynamic response patterns to deception. This interpretation is challenged by the results of the present study. Participants were required to memorize probe and target items (a banknote and a playing card, each). Subsequently, these items were repeatedly presented along with eight irrelevant items in a modified Guilty Knowledge Test design and participants were instructed to simply acknowledge item presentation by pressing one button after each stimulus. Despite the absence of response monitoring demands and thus overt response conflicts, the experiment revealed a differential physiological response pattern as a function of item type. First, probes elicited the largest skin conductance responses. Second, differential hemodynamic responses were observed in bilateral inferior frontal regions, the right supramarginal gyrus and the supplementary motor area as a function of item type. Probes and targets were accompanied by a larger signal increase than irrelevant items in these regions. Moreover, the responses to probes differed substantially from targets. The observed neural response pattern seems to rely on retrieval processes that depend on the depth of processing in the encoding situation. © The Author (2009).

,"For Distinguished Early Career Contribution To Psychophysiology: Award Address, 1988: Individual Differences In Heart Rate Response During Behavioral Challenge","This program of experiments examined heart rate responses to mental arithmetic and a video game. Attention first focused on their metabolic relevance. Comparison with heart rate/oxygen consumption regression equations generated from isotonic exercise data revealed that the heart rate increases of certain individuals were considerably in excess of those necessitated by contemporary metabolic demand. Both temporal and intertask consistency of reaction were explored, and supportive evidence was obtained. The relationship between laboratory and real‐world reactions was investigated, and preliminary evidence found suggesting that in‐laboratory responses are indicative of responses to more naturalistic stressors. Finally, twin studies examining the genetic and environmental determinants of individual differences in heart rate change during the tasks revealed a substantial genetic component for these responses.

,Fragmentation Transition In A Coevolving Network With Link-State Dynamics,"We study a network model that couples the dynamics of link states with the evolution of the network topology. The state of each link, either A or B, is updated according to the majority rule or zero-temperature Glauber dynamics, in which links adopt the state of the majority of their neighboring links in the network. Additionally, a link that is in a local minority is rewired to a randomly chosen node. While large systems evolving under the majority rule alone always fall into disordered topological traps composed by frustrated links, any amount of rewiring is able to drive the network to complete order, by relinking frustrated links and so releasing the system from traps. However, depending on the relative rate of the majority rule and the rewiring processes, the system evolves towards different ordered absorbing configurations: either a one-component network with all links in the same state or a network fragmented in two components with opposite states. For low rewiring rates and finite-size networks there is a domain of bistability between fragmented and nonfragmented final states. Finite-size scaling indicates that fragmentation is the only possible scenario for large systems and any nonzero rate of rewiring. © 2014 American Physical Society.",doi,10.1103/PhysRevE.89.062802,Scopus,"Physical Review E - Statistical, Nonlinear, and Soft Matter Physics","Carro A., Vazquez F., Toral R., San Miguel M.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,"From P0 To P6 Medicine, A Model Of Highly Participatory, Narrative, Interactive, And ""Augmented"" Medicine: Some Considerations On Salvatore Iaconesi's Clinical Story","Salvatore Iaconesi was recently diagnosed with a brain tumor. He decided to share his clinical records not only with doctors but with everybody who wishes to find him a cure. ""Because cure is not unique,"" he emphasizes ""there are cures for the body and cures for the soul, and everyone, from a painter to a musician, can find me a cure. Please, feel free to take my clinical history for example and let it become a game, a video, a music, a picture, whatever you like."" The emblematic hallmark of the changing times, Salvatore Iaconesi's case is an example of how many profound revolutions and steps medicine has undertaken during the past few centuries. Stemming from a form of remote medical paternalism and arriving at the concept of a therapeutic alliance, medicine nowadays faces challenges and opportunities at a level before unforeseeable and unimaginable. The new concept of P6 medicine (personalized, predictive, preventive, participatory, psychocognitive, and public) is discussed, together with its profound implications. © 2013 Bragazzi, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.",doi,10.2147/PPA.S38578,Scopus,Patient Preference and Adherence,Bragazzi N.L.,2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Functional And Structural Neural Indices Of Risk Aversion In Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (Ocd),"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) patients suffer from risk aversion, which may be mediated by their exaggerated response to threat and diminished response to reward. In this study, 13 OCD patients and 13 healthy matched controls underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while playing an interactive risky choice game encompassing distinct intervals of threat and reward; as well as anatomical diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Compared to healthy controls OCD patients were reluctant to make risky choices during the game. Furthermore, they displayed higher amygdala activation to threat; lower nucleus accumbens (Nacc) activation to reward and reduced functional connectivity of the amygdala and Nacc to two frontal regions, the orbito-frontal cortex (OFC) and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), respectively. OCD patients also displayed reduced structural integrity in clusters within the uncinate and cingulum fiber tracts. Finally, these deficits in limbic-frontal connectivity pathways, both at the functional and structural level, were associated with severity of OCD symptoms, as well as with each other. Our results thus suggest that risk aversion in OCD is mediated by abnormal limbic responses to threatening and rewarding stimuli, as well as by deficient functional and structural limbic-frontal connectivity. Such deficiency characterization may aid in identifying neural predictors for treatment response and localizing individual targets for direct neural intervention treatments. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.pscychresns.2012.02.002,Scopus,Psychiatry Research - Neuroimaging,"Admon R., Bleich-Cohen M., Weizmant R., Poyurovsky M., Faragian S., Hendler T.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Fusing Visual And Behavioral Cues For Modeling User Experience In Games,"Estimating affective and cognitive states in conditions of rich human-computer interaction, such as in games, is a field of growing academic and commercial interest. Entertainment and serious games can benefit from recent advances in the field as, having access to predictors of the current state of the player (or learner) can provide useful information for feeding adaptation mechanisms that aim to maximize engagement or learning effects. In this paper, we introduce a large data corpus derived from 58 participants that play the popular Super Mario Bros platform game and attempt to create accurate models of player experience for this game genre. Within the view of the current research, features extracted both from player gameplay behavior and game levels, and player visual characteristics have been used as potential indicators of reported affect expressed as pairwise preferences between different game sessions. Using neuroevolutionary preference learning and automatic feature selection, highly accurate models of reported engagement, frustration, and challenge are constructed (model accuracies reach 91%, 92%, and 88% for engagement, frustration, and challenge, respectively). As a step further, the derived player experience models can be used to personalize the game level to desired levels of engagement, frustration, and challenge as game content is mapped to player experience through the behavioral and expressivity patterns of each player. © 2013 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TCYB.2013.2271738,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,"Shaker N., Asteriadis S., Yannakakis G.N., Karpouzis K.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Game-Theoretic Modeling And Control Of Military Operations With Partially Emotional Civilian Players,"Civilians are not just passively static but might purposefully take actions to help one side in a battle. Sometimes civilians might directly join one side if they are excessively agitated by the other side. In this paper, a three-player attrition-type discrete time dynamic game model is formulated, in which there are two opposing forces and one civilian player that might be neutral, biased, or even joining one side publicly. Emotions of civilians are dynamically updated via anger mechanism. An example scenario and extensive simulations illustrate possible applications of this model, and comparative discussions further clarify the benefits. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

,Gender Differences In Cardiovascular Reactivity And Game Performance Related To Sensory Modality In Violent Video Game Play,"This study examined the gender-specific cardiovascular and performance responses to playing the violent video game ""DOOM"" with and without the soundtrack. Men and women equally rated the game as more violent with the soundtrack. Men performed the game about twice as well with the soundtrack. Women's performance did not change at all. Only men's heart rates were significantly greater with the soundtrack, indicative of arousal. Only women's systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly greater with the soundtrack, indicative of stress. The game seemed to appeal more to men than to women. Moreover, women may possibly avoid violent video games, in part because they represent an undesirable stressor. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing, Inc.",doi,10.1111/j.1559-1816.2007.00248.x,Scopus,Journal of Applied Social Psychology,Tafalla R.J.,2007,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Graphics Processing Unit-Based Bioheat Simulation To Facilitate Rapid Decision Making Associated With Cryosurgery Training,"This study focuses on the implementation of an efficient numerical technique for cryosurgery simulations on a graphics processing unit as an alternative means to accelerate runtime. This study is part of an ongoing effort to develop computerized training tools for cryosurgery, with prostate cryosurgery as a developmental model. The ability to perform rapid simulations of various test cases is critical to facilitate sound decision making associated with medical training. Consistent with clinical practice, the training tool aims at correlating the frozen region contour and the corresponding temperature field with the target region shape. The current study focuses on the feasibility of graphics processing unit-based computation using C++ accelerated massive parallelism, as one possible implementation. Benchmark results on a variety of computation platforms display between 3-fold acceleration (laptop) and 13-fold acceleration (gaming computer) of cryosurgery simulation, in comparison with the more common implementation on a multicore central processing unit. While the general concept of graphics processing unit-based simulations is not new, its application to phase-change problems, combined with the unique requirements for cryosurgery optimization, represents the core contribution of the current study. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.",doi,10.1177/1533034615580694,Scopus,Technology in Cancer Research and Treatment,"Keelan R., Zhang H., Shimada K., Rabin Y.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Head Movement And Facial Expressions As Game Input,"This study aimed to develop and test a hands-free video game that utilizes information on the player's real-time face position and facial expressions as intrinsic elements of a gameplay. Special focus was given to investigating the user's subjective experiences in utilizing computer vision input in the game interaction. The player's goal was to steer a drunken character home as quickly as possible by moving their head. Additionally, the player could influence the behavior of game characters by using the facial expressions of frowning and smiling. The participants played the game with computer vision and a conventional joystick and rated the functionality of the control methods and their emotional and game experiences. The results showed that although the functionality of the joystick steering was rated higher than that of the computer vision method, the use of head movements and facial expressions enhanced the experiences of game playing in many ways. The participants rated playing with the computer vision technique as more entertaining, interesting, challenging, immersive, and arousing than doing so with a joystick. The results suggested that a high level of experienced arousal in the case of computer vision-based interaction may be a key factor for better experiences of game playing. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",doi,10.1016/j.entcom.2014.04.005,Scopus,Entertainment Computing,"Ilves M., Gizatdinova Y., Surakka V., Vankka E.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Health Status And Behavior Among Middle-School Children In A Midwest Community: What Are The Underpinnings Of Childhood Obesity?,"Background: Childhood obesity is one of the nation's foremost health challenges. How much of this is due to lifestyle choices? The objective of the study was to determine health behaviors that contribute to obesity in sixth-grade children. Methods: To assess which health habits contribute to childhood obesity, we studied body mass index, blood pressure, lipid profile, glucose, and heart rate recovery after a 3-minute step test among sixth-grade children enrolled in a school-based intervention study from 2004 to 2009, comparing health behaviors and physiologic markers in obese versus nonobese children. Univariate associations with obesity (P values ≤.10) were entered into a stepwise logistic regression to identify independent predictors. Results: Among 1,003 sixth graders (55% white, 15% African American; average age 11.5 years), 150 (15%) were obese. Obese students had higher levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, blood pressure, and recovery heart rates. They consumed more regular soda and school lunches but were less likely to engage in physical activities. Obese students were more likely to watch TV ≥2 hours per day. Independent predictors were watching TV or video games (odds ratio [OR] 1.19, 95% CI 1.06-1.33) and school lunch consumption (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.02-1.64); moderate exercise was protective (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82-0.98). Conclusions: Obesity is present in 15% of our sixth graders and is associated with major differences in cardiovascular risk factors. Opportunities to improve childhood health should emphasize programs that increase physical activity, reduce recreational screen time, and improve nutritional value of school lunches. Whether genetic or not, childhood obesity can be attacked. © 2010 Mosby, Inc.",doi,10.1016/j.ahj.2010.09.019,Scopus,American Heart Journal,"Eagle T.F., Gurm R., Goldberg C.S., Durussel-Weston J., Kline-Rogers E., Palma-Davis L., Aaronson S., Fitzgerald C.M., Mitchell L.R., Rogers B., Bruenger P., Jackson E.A., Eagle K.A.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Heart Rate Increase To Alcohol Administration And Video Lottery Terminal Play Among Probable Pathological Gamblers And Nonpathological Gamblers,"The authors examined heart-rate responses to alcohol consumption and video lottery terminal (VLT) play. Regular VLT players (30 probable pathological gamblers [PPGs]: 30 nonpathological gamblers [NPGs]) were randomized to an alcohol (mean postdrinking blood alcohol concentration = 0.056%) or placebo condition. Heart rate was recorded at pre- and postdrinking baselines and during VLT play. Consistent with an earlier study (S. H. Stewart, P. Collins, J. R. Blackburn, M. Ellery, & R. Klein, 2005), alcohol-condition participants displayed elevated heart rates relative to placebo-condition participants only at postdrinking and VLT play. Moreover, alcohol-condition participants showed a greater heart rate increase to VLT play than did placebo-condition participants. However, PPGs were not more susceptible to alcohol- and/or VLT play-induced heart rate accelerations than were NPGs. Implications for gambling/ alcohol-disorder comorbidity are discussed.

,"Heritability Of Daytime Cortisol Levels And Cortisol Reactivity In Children. Psychoneuroendocrinology, 34(2), 273–280.","Individuals differ widely in cortisol output over the day and cortisol reactivity to challenge, both of which are relevant to disease risk. There is limited evidence concerning the heritability of these differences, so we evaluated the heritability of cortisol levels in the afternoon and cortisol reactivity using a twin design. The study involved 80 monozygotic (MZ) and 70 dizygotic (DZ) same-sex twin pairs aged 11.2 years on average. Salivary cortisol was measured in the afternoon at home before and after playing a computer game. Ratings of excitement and upset were also obtained, and objective task performance was assessed. Salivary cortisol levels averaged 4.08 (S.D. 2.3) nmol/l at pretask baseline, and declined on average over the session to 3.45 (1.9) nmol/l immediately after the tasks and 2.87 (1.6) nmol/l 10min later. There were, however, marked individual differences, with cortisol reactivity (difference between pretask baseline and post-task 1) ranging from +4.53 to -6.23nmol/l. Intra-class correlations for all the cortisol parameters were substantially greater for MZ (range 0.41-0.57) than for DZ (0.11-0.29) twin pairs. Quantitative genetic modelling confirmed significant heritability for pretask baseline cortisol (58%), the two post-task values (60 and 56%), and cortisol reactivity (44%). The study lacked power for assessing sex differences. Subjective reports of excitement were also somewhat heritable, but there was little covariation of cortisol and subjective responses, so genetic influences on covariation could not be tested. These findings indicate that individual differences in children's cortisol levels recorded before tasks and cortisol reactivity to behavioural challenges are influenced by genetic factors.",doi,10.1016/j.psyneuen.2008.09.006,nagy2015,Psychoneuroendocrinology,"Steptoe, A., van Jaarsveld, C.

,Hierarchical Relationship Of Negative Emotion Perception From Violent Video Games,"Video games featuring violent contents have become more and more prevalent among children and teenagers. It is therefore imperative to ponder on questions such as ‘Are violent video games dangerous digital games?’ and ‘What negative emotions do they trigger in gamers?’ As such, this study aims to explore the negative emotions that violent video games trigger in gamers and determine the cause for each negative emotion. For the purpose of this research, Resident Evil, a violent video game, has been chosen as the focus. Taking the gamer’s perspective, the study aims to explore and construct a thorough network structure (game triggered event—gamer’s personal belief—feeling of negative emotions) of gamer’s emotions, the structure of gamers’ emotional cluster and the correlation and level of inter-influence between relevant factors. Results of the study reveal that the overall hierarchical value map (HVM) not only presents a comprehensive gamer emotional network structure but also offers a clear illustration of how key game activating events (enemies, stage mission, BOSS level monsters, horror atmosphere, third-person view) lead to the formation of gamers’ personal beliefs of character death, high difficulty, trigger negative emotion, being frightened, enemy ambush and tough enemies, which ultimately lead to negative emotions such as fear, worry, anger, disgust and frustration on gamers’ part. In addition, among the five gamer emotional clusters, the clusters of fear and anger had the heaviest influence on the gamers. The correlation between factors and influence showed different levels of significance. © 2017, © 2017 SAGE Publications.",doi,10.1177/0971721817702281,Scopus,"Science, Technology and Society","Lin H.-W., Luarn P., Lin Y.-L.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Hip Hop Dance Experience Linked To Sociocognitive Ability,"Expertise within gaming (e.g., chess, video games) and kinesthetic (e.g., sports, classical dance) activities has been found to be linked with specific cognitive skills. Some of these skills, working memory, mental rotation, problem solving, are linked to higher performance in science, technology, math, and engineering (STEM) disciplines. In the present study, we examined whether experience in a different activity, hip hop dance, is also linked to cognitive abilities connected with STEM skills as well as social cognition ability. Dancers who varied in hip hop and other dance style experience were presented with a set of computerized tasks that assessed working memory capacity, mental rotation speed, problem solving efficiency, and theory of mind. We found that, when controlling for demographic factors and other dance style experience, those with greater hip hop dance experience were faster at mentally rotating images of hands at greater angle disparities and there was a trend for greater accuracy at identifying positive emotions displayed by cropped images of human faces. We suggest that hip hop dance, similar to other more technical activities such as video gameplay, tap some specific cognitive abilities that underlie STEM skills. Furthermore, we suggest that hip hop dance experience can be used to reach populations who may not otherwise be interested in other kinesthetic or gaming activities and potentially enhance select sociocognitive skills. © 2017 Bonny et al.

,Hostility Among Adolescents In Switzerland. Multivariate Relations Between Excessive Media Use And Forms Of Violence.,"purpose To determine what kind of violence-related behavior or opinion is directly related to excessive media use among adolescents in Switzerland.
Methods A national representative sample of 4222 schoolchildren (7th- and 8th-graders; mean age 13.9 years) answered questions on the frequency of television-viewing, electronic game-playing, feeling unsafe at school, bullying others, hitting others, and fighting with others, as part of the Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children (HBSC) international collaborative study protocol. The Chi-square tests and multiple logistic regression analyses were applied to high-risk groups of adolescents. Results For the total sample, all bivariate relationships between television-viewing/electronic game-playing and each violence-related variable are significant. In the multivariate comparison, physical violence among boys ceases to be significant. For girls, only television-viewing is linked to indirect violence. Against the hypothesis, females’ electronic game-playing only had a bearing on hitting others. Conclusions Experimental designs are needed that take into account gender, different forms of media, and violence to answer the question of whether excessive media use leads to violent behavior. With the exception of excessive electronic game-playing among girls, this study found that electronic media are not thought to lead directly to real-life violence but to hostility and indirect violence.",doi,10.1016/j.jadohealth.2003.05.001,anderson2010,Journal of Adolescent Health,"Kuntsche, E.

,How Games Induce Cooperation? A Study On The Relationship Between Game Features And We-Intentions In An Augmented Reality Game,"Seamless cooperation between individuals is essentially a crucial aspect of any successful endeavor. A host of literature has been published in the academic realm about how cooperation could be cultivated. However, true cooperation often forms organically without external enforcement. Recently, there has been one special example of a context where cooperation seemed to have effortlessly sprung up between people who might not even have had previous connections. The context is video/online games; games such as Ingress, Pokémon Go, and World of Warcraft bind people together to work against insurmountable odds and to overcome jointly held challenges. Organizations of many types have recently begun to gamify their structures and services in order to cultivate such seamless cooperation. However, before this potential of games can be successfully wielded outside video games, we need to understand better how games are able to cultivate such cooperation. Therefore, in this study we investigate how games can induce and cultivate we-intention of working as a group. Specifically, we investigate how cooperative game features affect different forms of group dynamics and how they further translate into we-intentions. We employ data from users of the augmented reality game Ingress (N = 206). The results show that cooperative game features induce we-intentions via positively increasing group norms, social identity, joint commitment, attitudes toward cooperation, and anticipated positive emotions. The findings imply that practitioners who are looking to increase cooperation should find that gamification inspired by cooperative game design is beneficial and preferable over individual-based gamification efforts. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",doi,10.1016/j.chb.2017.08.026,Scopus,Computers in Human Behavior,"Morschheuser B., Riar M., Hamari J., Maedche A.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,"How Impulsiveness, Trait Anger, And Extracurricular Activities Might Affect Aggression In School Children.","Individual differences in personality traits such as impulsivity and trait anger as well as environmental variables have an impact on aggressiveness. We tested a model incorporating the related variables of impulsiveness, trait anger, and aggression and incorporated the possible mediating influences of leisure-time activities. Regression analyses of data from 1129 pre-adolescents and 1093 adolescents (55.4% females) from a study evaluating the Spanish version of the Buss and Perry aggression questionnaire (AQ; Santisteban, Alvarado, & Recio, 2007) showed a relation between impulsiveness (Barratt Impulsiveness Scale) and aggression (AQ). Trait anger (Spielberger’s State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory), the time spent watching TV and playing video games, and the time spent doing homework (all related to impulsiveness) also are related to physical, as well as verbal aggression (with low to moderate coefficients). Multiple mediation analyses confirm that media violence exposure and homework, respectively, can have aggravating and attenuating effects on self-reported aggression. These results provide key variables for longitudinal studies which could reveal the causal nature of the results found with our cross-sectional design.",doi,10.1016/j.paid.2008.07.001,anderson2010,Personality and Individual Differences,"Wittman, M., Arce, E., Santisteban, C.",2008,NA,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,How Long Do The Short-Term Violent Video Game Effects Last?,"How long do the effects of the initial short-term increase in aggression and physiological arousal last after violent video game play? Study 1 (N = 91) had participants complete pre- and postvideo game measures of aggressive thoughts, aggressive feelings, and heart rate. Then, participants completed Time 3 measures after 4min or 9min of delay. Study 2 employed a similar procedure, but had participants (N = 91) complete the hot sauce paradigm to assess aggressive behavior after a 0, 5, or 10 min delay. First, results indicated that aggressive feelings, aggressive thoughts, aggressive behavior, and heart rate initially increased after violent video game play. Second, results of the delay condition revealed that the increase in aggressive feelings and aggressive thoughts lasted less than 4min, whereas heart rate and aggressive behavior lasted 4-9min. Aggr.

,How Much Control Is Enough? Influence Of Unreliable Input On User Experience,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) provide a valuable new input modality within human-computer interaction systems. However, like other body-based inputs such as gesture or gaze based systems, the system recognition of input commands is still far from perfect. This raises important questions, such as what level of control should such an interface be able to provide. What is the relationship between actual and perceived control? And in the case of applications for entertainment in which fun is an important part of user experience, should we even aim for the highest level of control, or is the optimum elsewhere? In this paper, we evaluate whether we can modulate the amount of control and if a game can be fun with less than perfect control. In the experiment users (n=158) played a simple game in which a hamster has to be guided to the exit of a maze. The amount of control the user has over the hamster is varied. The variation of control through confusion matrices makes it possible to simulate the experience of using a BCI, while using the traditional keyboard for input. After each session the user completed a short questionnaire on user experience and perceived control. Analysis of the data showed that the perceived control of the user could largely be explained by the amount of control in the respective session. As expected, user frustration decreases with increasing control. Moreover, the results indicate that the relation between fun and control is not linear. Although at lower levels of control fun does increase with improved control, the level of fun drops just before perfect control is reached (with an optimum around 96%). This poses new insights for developers of games who want to incorporate some form of BCI or other modality with unreliable input in their game: for creating a fun game, unreliable input can be used to create a challenge for the user. © 2013 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TCYB.2013.2282279,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,"Van De Laar B., Bos D.P.-O., Reuderink B., Poel M., Nijholt A.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Hpasubc: A Suite Of Tools For User Subclassification Of Human Protein Atlas Tissue Images.,"The human protein atlas (HPA) is a powerful proteomic tool for visualizing the distribution of protein expression across most human tissues and many common malignancies. The HPA includes immunohistochemically-stained images from tissue microarrays (TMAs) that cover 48 tissue types and 20 common malignancies. The TMA data are used to provide expression information at the tissue, cellular, and occasionally, subcellular level. The HPA also provides subcellular data from confocal immunofluorescence data on three cell lines. Despite the availability of localization data, many unique patterns of cellular and subcellular expression are not documented. To get at this more granular data, we have developed a suite of Python scripts, HPASubC, to aid in subcellular, and cell-type specific classification of HPA images. This method allows the user to download and optimize specific HPA TMA images for review. Then, using a playstation-style video game controller, a trained observer can rapidly step through 10's of 1000's of images to identify patterns of interest. We have successfully used this method to identify 703 endothelial cell (EC) and/or smooth muscle cell (SMCs) specific proteins discovered within 49,200 heart TMA images. This list will assist us in subdividing cardiac gene or protein array data into expression by one of the predominant cell types of the myocardium: Myocytes, SMCs or ECs. The opportunity to further characterize unique staining patterns across a range of human tissues and malignancies will accelerate our understanding of disease processes and point to novel markers for tissue evaluation in surgical pathology.",doi,10.4103/2153-3539.159213,pubmed,Journal of pathology informatics,"Cornish, Toby C; Chakravarti, Aravinda; Kapoor, Ashish; Halushka, Marc K",2015,NA,NA,reviewer2,Lydia

,"Impact Of An Active Educational Video Game On Children's Motivation, Science Knowledge, And Physical Activity","Background: Active educational video games (AVGs) appear to have a positive effect on elementary school students' motivation leading to enhanced learning outcomes. The purpose of this study was to identify the effectiveness of an AVG on elementary school students' science knowledge learning, physical activity (PA) level, and interest-based motivation. Methods: In this randomized controlled study, 53 elementary school students were assigned to an experimental condition or a comparison condition. The experimental condition provided an AVG learning environment, whereas the comparison condition was based on sedentary educational video games. Results: The results of repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) on the knowledge test showed that students in both groups performed better on the post-test than they did on the pre-test (p &lt; 0.001, η2 = 0.486), and their post-test scores did not differ significantly. The experimental condition provided a more active environment since the students' average heart rates (HRs) were in the Target-Heart-Rate-Zone (HR = 134 bpm), which was significantly higher than the average HR (103 bpm) from the comparison condition (t = 7.212, p &lt; 0.001). Students in the experimental condition perceived a higher level of situational interest than their counterparts in the comparison group (p &lt; 0.01, and η2 = 0.301). Conclusion: These results suggest that AVGs benefit children more in terms of PA and motivation than traditional video games by providing an enjoyable learning experience and sufficient PA. © 2016.",doi,10.1016/j.jshs.2014.12.004,Scopus,Journal of Sport and Health Science,"Sun H., Gao Y.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Improving Empathic Communication Skills In Adults With Autism Spectrum Disorder,"The literature suggests that many individuals diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) experience challenges with recognizing and describing emotions in others, which may result in difficulties with the verbal expression of empathy during communication. Thus, there is a need for intervention techniques targeting this area. Using a multiple baseline across participants design, this study examined the effectiveness of a video-feedback intervention with a visual framework component to improve verbal empathetic statements and questions during conversation for adults with ASD. Following intervention, all participants improved in verbal expression of empathetic statements and empathetic questions during conversation with generalization and maintenance of gains. Furthermore, supplemental assessments indicated that each participant improved in their general level of empathy and confidence in communication skills. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",doi,10.1007/s10803-015-2633-0,Scopus,Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders,"Kern Koegel L., Ashbaugh K., Navab A., Koegel R.L.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Increased Frequency Of Social Interaction Is Associated With Enjoyment Enhancement And Reward System Activation,"Positive social interactions contribute to the sense that one's life has meaning. Enjoyment of feelings associated through social interaction motivates humans to build social connections according to their personal preferences. Therefore, we hypothesized that social interaction itself activates the reward system in a manner that depends upon individual interaction preferences. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study in which 38 participants played a virtual ball-toss game in which the number of ball tosses to the participant was either similar to (normal-frequency condition) or higher than (high-frequency condition) the number of tosses to the other players. Participants reported greater-than-anticipated enjoyment during the high-frequency condition, suggesting that receiving a social reward led to unexpected positive feelings. Consistent with this, the high-frequency condition produced stronger activation in the ventral striatum, which is part of the reward system, and the precuneus, representing positive self-image, which might be translated to social reward. Furthermore, ventral striatal activation covaried with individual participants' preference for interactions with others. These findings suggest that an elevated frequency of social interaction is represented as a social reward, which might motivate individuals to promote social interaction in a manner that is modulated by personal preference.",doi,10.1038/srep24561,Scopus,Scientific Reports,"Kawamichi H., Sugawara S.K., Hamano Y.H., Makita K., Kochiyama T., Sadato N.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Increased Neural Reactivity To Socio-Emotional Stimuli Links Social Exclusion And Aggression,"We investigated changes in the neural processing of social information as possible link between social exclusion and aggression. Participants played a virtual ball game with two putative game partners, during which half of the 34 participants were excluded. Then, participants played the Taylor Aggression Paradigm (TAP) against the same partners. An empathy paradigm followed, in which participants watched pictures of neutral and emotional social scenes, while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Excluded participants showed stronger neural reactivity to emotional compared to neutral pictures than included participants in regions associated with cognitive mentalizing and the mirror neuron system (bilateral superior, middle and inferior temporal gyrus, bilateral precuneus, right precentral gyrus). Reactivity of left inferior temporal gyrus and right precentral gyrus was positively correlated with aggressive behavior in the TAP. Our results support previous behavioral findings which suggest changes in social information processing as mediator between exclusion and aggression. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",doi,10.1016/j.biopsycho.2013.12.008,Scopus,Biological Psychology,"Beyer F., Münte T.F., Krämer U.M.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Influence Of Control And Physical Effort On Cardiovascular Reactivity To A Video Game Task,"This study investigated the influences of both perceived control and physical effort on cardiovascular reactivity. Undergraduates (N = 32) played a video game task interrupted by aversive noise. Perceived control of the noise was manipulated by instructions indicating the presence or absence of a contingency between performance and noise presentations. Physical effort was manipulated by controlling the physical force required to perform the task. There was a significant main effect of control on systolic blood pressure (SBP) and total peripheral resistance (TPR), with both increasing more during low than high control conditions, The results suggest that high perceived control over aversive noise in an effortful task reduces SBP and TPR reactivity relative to low perceived control. The results are consistent with the idea that control buffers the reactivity associated with task performance under aversive conditions.",doi,10.1017/S0048577202394083,Scopus,Psychophysiology,"Weinstein S.E., Quigley K.S., Mordkoff J.T.",2002,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Instructional Design Talks To Game Design,"Purpose: This paper aims to identify successful game strategies that are used in digital video games and match those strategies to practices that may be incorporated in instructional design to gamify the learning experience. Design/methodology/approach: The identification of successful strategies is based on literature explaining gamification and game strategies. Examples and suggestions of gamification are included from scholars, business leaders and actual practices. Findings: The successful game strategies identified can be transferred into the learning environment without the inclusion of video games. Strategies identified support learner competence, relatedness and autonomy and encourage instructional designers or instructors to examine game play, realize how play can be used to provide more meaningful experiences to learners and rethink assessments. Originality/value: The identified game elements are supported by motivation theory. These identifications offer instructional designers a list of game elements from which they may refer when designing in the future. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",doi,10.1108/OTH-10-2016-0052,Scopus,On the Horizon,Keener C.P.,2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,"Intelligent Adaptive Cyber-Physical Ecosystem For Aerospace Engineering Education, Training, And Accelerated Workforce Development","Transformative changes are on the horizon in aerospace engineering education and learning in general. These changes are attributable, in part, to the developments of a number of aerospace, learning and other leading-edge technologies and their synergistic combinations and convergence. The related technologies include ubiquitous, cloud, and petascale/exascale computing; ultrahigh-bandwidth networks; pervasive wireless communication; intelligent autonomous robotics; artificial general intelligence; powerful game engines and facilities; networked immersive virtual environments and virtual worlds; augmented and enhanced reality; and novel human-technology interfaces. This paper describes some of the frontiers of, and challenges in, future aerospace systems and the drivers for transformative changes in aerospace engineering education. The need to have a holistic perspective and a comprehensive approach for aerospace education, research, training, and accelerated workforce development is outlined. A starting point to accomplish this task is the development of an intelligent adaptive cyber-physical ecosystem for the aerospace workforce. The continuously expanding major components of the ecosystem include integrated knowledge discovery and exploitation facilities; novel agent-supported visual simulations (with cognitive learning and understanding abilities); immersive three-dimensional (3D) virtual world facilities; intelligent, multimodal and humanlike interfaces; and smart mobile wireless devices.

,Intention Modulates The Effect Of Punishment Threat In Norm Enforcement Via The Lateral Orbitofrontal Cortex,"Although economic theories suggest that punishment threat is crucial for maintaining social norms, counterexamples are noted in which punishment threat hinders norm compliance. Such discrepancy may arise from the intention behind the threat: unintentionally introduced punishment threat facilitates, whereas intentionally introduced punishment threat hinders, norm compliance. Here, we combined a dictator game and fMRI to investigate how intention modulates the effect of punishment threat on norm compliance and the neural substrates of this modulation. Wealso investigated whether this modulation can be influenced by brain stimulation. Humanparticipants divided an amount of money between themselves and a partner. The partner (intentionally) or a computer program (unintentionally) decided to retain or waive the right to punish the participant upon selfish distribution. Compared with the unintentional condition, participants allocated more when the partner intentionally waived the power of punishment, but less when the partner retained such power. The right lateral orbitofrontal cortex (rLOFC) showed higher activation when the partner waived compared with when the computer waived or when the partner retained the power. The functional connectivity between the rLOFC and the brain network associated with intention/mentalizing processing was predictive of the allocation difference induced by intention. Moreover, inhibition or activation of the rLOFC by brain stimulation decreased or increased, respectively, the participants’ reliance on the partner’s intention during monetary allocation. These findings demonstrate that the perceived intention of punishment threat plays a crucial role in norm compliance and that the LOFC is casually involved in the implementation of intention-based cooperative decisions. © 2016 the authors.",doi,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0595-16.2016,Scopus,Journal of Neuroscience,"Zhang Y., Yu H., Yin Y., Zhou X.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia

,Intraoperative Image Navigation: Experimental Study Of The Feasibility And Surgeon Preference Between A Sterile Encased Nintendo Wiitm Remote And Standard Wireless Computer Mouse,"Diagnostic imaging plays an important role in the operating room, providing surgeons with a reference and surgical plan. Surgeon autonomy in the operating room has been suggested to decrease errors that stem from communication mistakes. A standard computer mouse was compared to a wireless remote-control style controller for computer game consoles (Wiimote) for the navigation of diagnostic imaging studies by sterile personnel in this prospective survey study. Participants were recruited from a cohort of residents and faculty that use the surgical suites at our institution. Outcome assessments were based on survey data completed by study participants following each use of either the mouse or Wiimote, and compared using an analysis of variance. The mouse was significantly preferred by the study participants in the categories of handling, accuracy and efficiency, and overall satisfaction (P <0.05). The mouse was preferred to both the Wiimote and to no device, when participants were asked to rank options for image navigation. This indicates the need for the implementation of intraoperative image navigation devices, to increase surgeon autonomy in the operating room. © 2017 American College of Veterinary Radiology",doi,10.1111/vru.12479,Scopus,Veterinary Radiology and Ultrasound,"Appleby R., zur Linden A., Sears W.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Investigating The Physiological And Psychosocial Responses Of Single- And Dual-Player Exergaming In Young Adults,"Objective: This study investigated the effect of acute exergaming on the physiological and psychosocial responses of young adults and the modulatory effect of a single- or dual-player game play situation. Materials and Methods: Thirty-six participants (19 male; 21.7 ± 3.8 years; 23.65 ± 3.17 kg/m2) each completed two 30-minute exergame sessions in a randomized order (single and dual player) while wearing an Actiheart® to estimate energy expenditure. Positive and negative affect, subjective vitality, and indices of intrinsic motivation were assessed directly after each gaming bout. Results: There was no significant difference in energy expenditure or psychosocial outcomes between conditions. Although males expended more energy than females in both single- (z = -2.124, P = 0.033) and dual-player situations (z = -2.679, P = 0.007), females reported significantly greater vitality (z = -2.219, P = 0.026) and effort/importance than males (z = -2.001, P = 0.045). Conversely, males reported a greater negative affect (z = -2.872, P = 0.004) and pressure/tension (z = -3.295, P = 0.001). A linear mixed effects model revealed that energy expenditure during exergaming was a significant predictor of interest and enjoyment (P = 0.001) and effort and importance (P = 0.001). This relationship between energy expenditure and psychosocial variables was not modulated by sex or order of gameplay (single or dual player first). Conclusion: The present results suggest that females have a more positive psychosocial response to exergaming relative to males, highlighting exergames such as Wii™ boxing as a potential avenue for future interventions seeking to address the low physical activity levels that characterize the young adult population. © 2016 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",doi,10.1089/g4h.2016.0015,Scopus,Games for Health Journal,"Mackintosh K.A., Standage M., Staiano A.E., Lester L., McNarry M.A.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Involuntary Memories After A Positive Film Are Dampened By A Visuospatial Task: Unhelpful In Depression But Helpful In Mania?,"Spontaneous negative mental images have been extensively researched due to the crucial role they play in conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder. However, people can also experience spontaneous positive mental images, and these are little understood. Positive images may play a role in promoting healthy positive mood and may be lacking in conditions such as depression. However, they may also occur in problematic states of elevated mood, such as in bipolar disorder. Can we apply an understanding of spontaneous imagery gained by the study of spontaneous negative images to spontaneous positive images? In an analogue of the trauma film studies, 69 volunteers viewed an explicitly positive (rather than traumatic) film. Participants were randomly allocated post-film either to perform a visuospatial task (the computer game 'Tetris') or to a no-task control condition. Viewing the film enhanced positive mood and immediately post-film increased goal setting on a questionnaire measure. The film was successful in generating involuntary memories of specific scenes over the following week. As predicted, compared with the control condition, participants in the visuospatial task condition reported significantly fewer involuntary memories from the film in a diary over the subsequent week. Furthermore, scores on a recognition memory test at 1week indicated an impairment in voluntary recall of the film in the visuospatial task condition. Clinical implications regarding the modulation of positive imagery after a positive emotional experience are discussed. Generally, boosting positive imagery may be a useful strategy for the recovery of depressed mood. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",doi,10.1002/cpp.1800,Scopus,Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy,"Davies C., Malik A., Pictet A., Blackwell S.E., Holmes E.A.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Is A Dark Virtual Environment Scary?,"This study investigated the effects of nighttime lighting conditions and stress on the affective appraisal of a virtual environment (VE). The effective application of VEs in emotionally intense simulations requires precise control over their characteristics that affect the user's emotions and behavior. It is known that humans have an innate fear of darkness, which increases after exposure to stress and extrapolates to ecologically valid (immersive) VEs. This study investigated if the simulated level of illumination determines the affective appraisal of a VE, particularly after stress. Participants explored either a daytime or a nighttime version of a VE, after performing either an acute psychosocial stress task (Trier Social Stress Test, or TSST) or a relaxing control task. The affective qualities of the VE were appraised through the Russel and Pratt semantic questionnaire on the valence and arousal dimensions. Distress was assessed through free salivary cortisol, the state self-report scale from the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and heart rate. In addition, memory for scenic details was tested through a yes-no recognition test. Free salivary cortisol levels, heart rates, and scores on the STAI all indicate that participants who were subjected to the stress task indeed showed signs of distress, whereas participants in the control group showed no signs of stress. The results of the semantic questionnaire and the recognition test showed no significant overall effect of time-of-day conditions on the affective appraisal of the VE or on the recognition of its details, even after prior stress. The experiences of users exploring the VE were not affected by the simulated lighting conditions, even after acute prior stress. Thus, lowering the illumination level in a desktop VE is not sufficient to elicit anxiety. Hence, desktop VE representations are different from immersive VE representations in this respect. This finding has implications for desktop VE representations that are deployed for serious gaming and training purposes. © Copyright 2009, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",doi,10.1089/cpb.2008.0293,Scopus,Cyberpsychology and Behavior,"Toet A., Van Welie M., Houtkamp J.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia

A Meta-Analysis Of Energy Expenditure In Active Video Games,"This article reports a meta-analysis of energy expenditure (EE) of playing active video games (AVGs). In particular, heart rate (HR), oxygen consumption (VO2), and EE were assessed and three moderators for the effects of AVGs-types of AVG, player age, and player weight status-were analyzed. The results show that playing AVGs significantly increased HR, VO2, and EE from resting. The effect sizes of playing AVGs on HR, VO2, and EE were similar to traditional physical activities. AVG type and player age were significant modera-tors for the effects of AVGs.

The Patent Reform Act of 2007 would establish a procedure for challenging patents after their issuance, limit the ability of litigants to gain support from sympathetic courts and redefine what constitutes willful infringement.

,Killing Is Positive! Intra-Game Responses Meet The Necessary (But Not Sufficient) Theoretical Conditions For Influencing Aggressive Behavior,"This paper reports a study designed to investigate whether playing violent video games elicits the psychological conditions theoretically required for media use to cause aggressive behavior. Specifically, the study was designed to examine whether these games elicit desensitization, facilitation, and disinhibition. Thus, does physiological arousal in response to violent activity decrease over time during game play, and is there a difference between novice and experienced game players (as would be expected if desensitization had occurred)? Do players experience positive emotional states when actively engaged in virtual violent behavior (fighting and killing opponents) - a necessary condition for disinhibition? Do game players frame their motivations in terms of self-defense and game success, as would be necessary for facilitation to occur? The results showed that playing first-person shooters did elicit these requisite patterns of cognitive, physiological, and emotional states. Violent game play is a positive, arousing, present, dominant experience, as required for disinhibition and facilitation. Experienced game players are less aroused than less experienced game players (as required for desensitization). Further, during a game-playing session, exploring and searching for enemies become less arousing, while fighting and killing become more arousing over time (as required by desensitization and facilitation). © 2012 Hogrefe Publishing.",doi,10.1027/1864-1105/a000075,Scopus,Journal of Media Psychology,"Lang A., Bradley S.D., Schneider E.F., Kim S.C., Mayell S.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,"Kin Rejection: Social Signals, Neural Response And Perceived Distress During Social Exclusion","Across species, kin bond together to promote survival. We sought to understand the dyadic effect of exclusion by kin (as opposed to non-kin strangers) on brain activity of the mother and her child and their subjective distress. To this end, we probed mother-child relationships with a computerized ball-toss game Cyberball. When excluded by one another, rather than by a stranger, both mothers and children exhibited a significantly pronounced frontal P2. Moreover, upon kin rejection versus stranger rejection, both mothers and children showed incremented left frontal positive slow waves for rejection events. Children reported more distress upon exclusion than their own mothers. Similar to past work, relatively augmented negative frontal slow wave activity predicted greater self-reported ostracism distress. This effect, generalized to the P2, was limited to mother- or child-rejection by kin, with comparable magnitude of effect across kin identity (mothers vs. children). For both mothers and children, the frontal P2 peak was significantly pronounced for kin rejection versus stranger rejection. Taken together, our results document the rapid categorization of social signals as kin relevant and the specificity of early and late neural markers for predicting felt ostracism. Kin rejection was examined by looking at neural responses in children and their mothers while playing the computer game Cyberball. Responses, specifically the frontal P2 and slow wave, were selectively greater for rejection by kin than by stranger. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",doi,10.1111/desc.12191,Scopus,Developmental Science,"Sreekrishnan A., Herrera T.A., Wu J., Borelli J.L., White L.O., Rutherford H.J.V., Mayes L.C., Crowley M.J.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Learning And Communication Via Imitation: An Autonomous Robot Perspective,"This paper proposes a neural network architecture designed to exhibit learning and communication capabilities via imitation. Our architecture allows a ""protoimitation"" behavior using the ""perception ambiguity"" inherent in real environments. In the perspective of turntaking and gestural communication between two agents, new experiments on movement synchronization in an interaction game are presented. Synchronization is obtained as a global attractor depending on the coupling between agents' dynamic. We also discuss the nonsupervised context of the imitation process and we present new experiments in which the same architecture is able to learn perception-action associations without any explicit reinforcement. The learning is based on the ability to detect novelty or irregularities in the communication rhythm.",doi,10.1109/3468.952717,Scopus,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Part A:Systems and Humans.","Andry P., Gaussier P., Moga S., Banquet J.P., Nadel J.",2001,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Leisure Time Activities Of Elementary School Children,"The three most common leisure time activities of 2,200 third and fourth grade children (mean age 8.8 + 0.8; 50.7% girls) and the association of the intensity levels of those activities with demographic variables and risk factors for cardiovascular disease are reported. Activities reported most often by boys were playing video games (33%), playing football (32%), bicycling (31%), watching television (28%), and playing basketball (26%). The girls reported doing homework (39%), bicycling (31%), watching television (30%), dancing (27%), and reading (23%). Overall, the children, especially girls, reported fairly sedentary activities, with an average metabolic equivalent level of 4.2 for girls and 4.8 for boys. Among boys, African Americans reported more vigorous activities than Whites, but the activities reported by White girls were somewhat more vigorous than those reported by non-White girls. Children from a higher socioeconomic status (SES), especially boys, reported a greater proportion of sedentary activities than lower SES children. The risk factors of cholesterol, blood pressure, skinfold thickness, and body mass index were not significantly associated with total activity score. However, significantly more nonobese than obese children reported a vigorous (high-intensity) activity as one of their top three activities.",doi,10.1097/00006199-199709000-00002,Scopus,Nursing Research,"Harrell J.S., Gansky S.A., Bradley C.B., Mcmurray R.G.",1997,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Lessons Learned About The Development Of Digital Entertainment Tools For Experiments On Resources Distribution,"Resource Distribution is a topic from the field of distributive judgement, generally studied by cognitive psychology researchers, which make use of economic experiments to investigate aspects of the evolution of cooperation, altruism and selfishness in humanity. Researchers commonly set experiments to observe human behavior, seeking to increase the degree of engagement of the participants, in order to improve the quality and the amount of results. Digital entertainment artifacts, such as video games, are then used as a viable way of bringing such a high level of engagement. However, psychology researchers usually do not have the knowledge needed to develop digital applications. In addition, as far as we know, no scientific work have tried to describe the impact of using digital entertainment tools in experiments on decision making for resource division. This work aims to report a compilation of discoveries and knowledge learned when designing digital entertainment tools, tailored for scientific experiments on Resources Distribution. The task included interviews with specialists, a questionnaire sent to researchers, the conduction of ideation techniques to generate new concepts and, finally, a set of tools were prototyped and a subset was ultimately developed. Results were collected and six main lessons we learned are reported. We hope these lessons learned to be helpful to guide others researchers to conceive and develop their own digital entertainment tools for scientific experimentation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",doi,10.1016/j.chb.2017.01.023,Scopus,Computers in Human Behavior,"Martins S.L., Cabral G.R.E., Junior L.D.S.M., Martins E.H.C.F., Cabral G.R.E.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Long Alternating Codes 1. Search By Playing Dominoes,"A new extremely effective method of finding strong alternating codes for incoherent scatter radars has been invented. The power of this method is described by the fact that the longest code known at the moment contains 4,194,304 bits, whereas the older methods could find codes only up to the length of 32 bits. This result means that strong alternating codes are now available for all needs of any present or future incoherent scatter hardware which one can imagine. The search method can be explained in two ways. The first one is an astonishing game of dominoes, which is not useful in the practical search but allows the search method to be easily visualized. The second presentation is a mathematical description of the method in a form suitable for computer search. The method is explained in a series of two papers. In this first paper the presentation of alternating codes in terms of Walsh indices is reviewed and the game of dominoes is described. The second paper gives the underlying mathematical formalism as well as several long codes in terms of their Walsh sequences.",doi,10.1029/96RS03118,Scopus,Radio Science,"Nygrén T., Markkanen M.",1997,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,"Longer You Play, The More Hostile You Feel: Examination Of First Person Shooter Video Games And Aggression During Video Game Play","This study investigated the effects of video game play on aggression. Using the General Aggression Model, as applied to video games by Anderson and Bushman, [2002) this study measured physiological arousal, state hostility, and how aggressively participants would respond to three hypothetical scenarios. In addition, this study measured each of these variables multiple times to gauge how aggression would change with increased video game play. Results showed a significant increase from baseline in hostility and aggression (based on two of the three story stems), which is consistent with the General Aggression Model. This study adds to the existing literature on video games and aggression by showing that increased play of a violent first person shooter video game can significantly increase aggression from baseline. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",doi,10.1002/ab.20227,Scopus,Aggressive Behavior,"Barlett C.P., Harris R.J., Baldassaro R.",2007,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Mah-Jong-Induced Epilepsy: A Special Reflex Epilepsy In Chinese Society,"We present five patients of epilepsy in which seizures were triggered by playing or watching the traditional Chinese gambling game ""Mah-Jong."" One patient also experienced seizures while playing a computer version of the Mah-Jong game. This condition appeared to have a predominance of males (80%) and middle-aged onset (39.4 years). Four patients had generalized tonic-clonic seizures and one patient had partial seizures with secondary generalization. No spontaneous seizure occurred in these patients. Three patients had been receiving antiepileptic drug therapy, but without effective control over their seizures. Mah-Jong-induced epilepsy is a very peculiar form of complex reflex epilepsy that involves the higher mental activities. This phenomenon may consist of distinct pathophysiologic mechanisms from other reflex epilepsy induced by thinking and spatial tasks in idiopathic generalized epilepsies. This unusual reflex epilepsy is relatively benign in nature and antiepileptic drug therapy has uncertain benefits. It may be necessary to avoid playing the Mah-Jong game in order to prevent seizures. © 2004 BEA Trading Ltd. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

,Making Work Fun: Investigating Antecedents Of Perceived Enjoyment In Human Computation Games For Information Sharing,"The advent of online games, crowdsourcing, and user-generated content has led to the emergence of a new paradigm called the Human Computation Games (HCGs) which utilize games as a motivator to encourage users' participation in human computation. HCGs are different from games for pure entertainment which emphasize play and fun, rather than output generation. Therefore, research has yet to fully explore the factors underlying players' perception of HCG enjoyment. In this paper, we study the influence of motivational needs satisfaction and perceived output quality on perceived HCG enjoyment using a survey (N = 205) of a location-based information sharing HCG called SPLASH, developed as part of our research. According to the results, perceived needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness influence perceived enjoyment of HCGs, suggesting that HCGs that fulfill these three needs are more likely to be enjoyable, thereby encouraging players to make useful computations. The results also show that participants who perceive higher levels output relevancy report a greater level of enjoyment, indicating that HCGs that assist players in generating relevant outputs are more likely to be perceived as enjoyable. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

,Match Analysis Of Elite Adolescent Team Handball Players,"Chelly, MS, Hermassi, S, Aouadi, R, Khalifa, R, Van den Tillaar, R, Chamari, K, and Shephard, RJ. Match analysis of elite adolescent team handball players. J Strength Cond Res 25(9): 2410-2417, 2011-The purposes of this study were to examine the activity profile of elite adolescent players during regular team handball games and to compare the physical and motor performance of players between the first and second halves of a match. Activity patterns (video analysis) and heartrate (HR) responses (telemetry) were monitored in top nationaldivision adolescent players (18 men, aged 15.1 ± 0.6 years) throughout 6 regulation games (25-minute halves with a 10- minute interval). The total distance covered a meraged 1,777 ± 264 m per game (7.4% less in the second than in the first half, p &gt; 0.05). Players ran 170 ± 24 m at high intensity and 866 12 m at maximal speed, with 3266 bouts of running (duration 2.36 0.3 seconds) at speeds &gt; 18 km·h -1; they stood still for 16% of the playing time. The mean HR during play was 172 ± 2 b·min -1 (82 ± 3% of maximal HR). Blood lactate concentrations at the end of the first and second halves were 9.7 ± 1.1 and 8.3 ± 0.9 mmol·L -1, respectively (difference p &lt; 0.05). We conclude that adolescent handball players cover less distance and engage in fewer technical actions in the second half of a match. This indicates that team handball is physiologically very demanding. The practical implication is that coaches should seek to sustain performance in the second period of a game by modifying playing tactics and maximizing both aerobic and anaerobic fi ness duringtraining sessions. © 2011 National Strength and Conditioning Association.",doi,10.1519/JSC.0b013e3182030e43,Scopus,Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research,"Chelly M.S., Hermassi S., Aouadi R., Khalifa R., Tillaar R.V.D., Chamari K., Shephard R.J.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Measuring The Sociocultural Appeal Of Sns Games In Taiwan,"Purpose: This study aims to explore the sociocultural appeal of SNS game content from the point of view of the human emotions aroused by the interaction between the players and the games. Design/methodology/approach: The author's research methodology is based on Miryoku Engineering. The author interviewed 11 knowledgeable gamers by the evaluation grid method (EGM) and surveyed 321 players through a questionnaire in order to gather data about their preferences, which were then analysed using quantification theory type I. Findings: The semantic structure of the appeal of the games was determined from interviews with knowledgeable gamers (EGM). This structure represents a hierarchy of the relationship between the types of appeal or appeal factors, the reasons for gamers' preferences, and the specific characteristics of SNS games. According to the statistical analysis, the most important sociocultural appeal factors of SNS games are ""practicable and realizable"" and ""innovative and unique"", and these are affected in varying degrees by particular reasons and characteristics. Practical implications: The author has found that sociocultural factors influence the design of SNS games significantly. In addition, the issue of how to integrate the sociocultural factors into the design of games is critical to the success of the marketing strategies of SNS games in different areas or countries. Originality/value: The author's findings provide important information for designers and researchers of SNS games. The study also contributes to the field of human-computer interaction in cyberspace. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",doi,10.1108/10662241311331781,Scopus,Internet Research,Shen K.-S.,2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,"Media Use, Face-To-Face Communication, Media Multitasking, And Social Well-Being Among 8- To 12-Year-Old Girls","An online survey of 3,461 North American girls ages 8-12 conducted in the summer of 2010 through Discovery Girls magazine examined the relationships between social well-being and young girls' media use-including video, video games, music listening, reading/homework, e-mailing/posting on social media sites, texting/instant messaging, and talking on phones/video chatting-and face-to-face communication. This study introduced both a more granular measure of media multitasking and a new comparative measure of media use versus time spent in face-to-face communication. Regression analyses indicated that negative social well-being was positively associated with levels of uses of media that are centrally about interpersonal interaction (e.g., phone, online communication) as well as uses of media that are not (e.g., video, music, and reading). Video use was particularly strongly associated with negative social well-being indicators. Media multitasking was also associated with negative social indicators. Conversely, face-to-face communication was strongly associated with positive social well-being. Cell phone ownership and having a television or computer in one's room had little direct association with children's socioemotional well-being. We hypothesize possible causes for these relationships, call for research designs to address causality, and outline possible implications of such findings for the social well-being of younger adolescents. © 2012 American Psychological Association.",doi,10.1037/a0027030,Scopus,Developmental Psychology,"Pea R., Nass C., Meheula L., Rance M., Kumar A., Bamford H., Nass M., Simha A., Stillerman B., Yang S., Zhou M.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Meta-Analysis Of Digital Game And Study Characteristics Eliciting Physiological Stress Responses,"Digital games have been used as stressors in a range of disciplines for decades. Nonetheless, the underlying characteristics of these stressors and the study in which the stressor was applied are generally not recognized for their moderating effect on the measured physiological stress responses. We have therefore conducted a meta-analysis that analyzes the effects of characteristics of digital game stressors and study design on heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, in studies carried out from 1976 to 2012. In order to assess the differing quality between study designs, a new scale is developed and presented, coined reliability of effect size. The results show specific and consistent moderating functions of both game and study characteristics, on average accounting for around 43%, and in certain cases up to 57% of the variance found in physiological stress responses. Possible cognitive and physiological processes underlying these moderating functions are discussed, and a new model integrating these processes with the moderating functions is presented. These findings indicate that a digital game stressor does not act as a stressor by virtue of being a game, but rather derives its stressor function from its characteristics and the methodology in which it is used. This finding, together with the size of the associated moderations, indicates the need for a standardization of digital game stressors. © 2015 Society for Psychophysiological Research.",doi,10.1111/psyp.12431,Scopus,Psychophysiology,"van der Vijgh B., Beun R.-J., Van Rood M., Werkhoven P.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Mobile Agents For Economic Market Simulation,"This paper reports on the development of an economic market simulator using mobile agents. Agents are specialized software programs that can move autonomously between supporting platforms. Agents can be used to model the preferences of users wishing to buy or sell items on a global marketplace. Users can select a number of options that will guide the agents in their quest for an optimal trade. Besides the price range, users can determine the way in which the agents will bargain, thus fine-tuning the tradeoffs involved in deciding whether a price in the price range requires further negotiation or is acceptable. The simulation developed is realized entirely in Java, and takes advantage of TEEMA, an extensible, general-purpose mobile agent execution environment, dedicated to the purpose of exploring the capabilities of mobile agents. TEEMA has been realized to provide a testbed for agent applications without having to be limited by proprietary application suites or inaccessible low-level interfaces. It is completely configurable and easily extensible as it is built around a microkernel that supports primitive agent operations and a set of services that provide high-level agent support. The paper starts with the description of the infrastructure necessary to define a marketplace as a combination of service agents. Then, trader agents are explained. The simulation environment is then introduced, and analyzed. The architecture emerging from the simulation environment is then examined, together with its advantages and disadvantages. Finally, the simulation parameters are presented. An analysis of the results shows that the simulation environment can provide a suitable platform for economic simulation based on empirical analysis or more formal systems such as game theory. An example of asymmetric transaction is presented where it is shown that trades are influenced by the agent initiating the transaction.",doi,10.1109/CCECE.2002.1013037,Scopus,Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering,"Puttha J., Benedicenti L., Paranjape R.",2002,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Multi-Modal System Architecture For Serious Gaming,"Human-computer interaction (HCI), especially in the games domain, targets to mimic as much as possible the natural human-to-human interaction, which is multimodal, involving speech, vision, haptic, etc. Furthermore, the domain of serious games, aiming to value-added games, makes use of additional inputs, such as biosensors, motion tracking equipment, etc. In this context, game development has become complex, expensive and burdened with a long development cycle. This creates barriers to independent game developers and inhibits the introduction of innovative games, or new game genres. In this paper the PlayMancer platform is introduced, a work in progress aiming to overcome such barriers by augmenting existing 3D game engines with innovative modes of interaction. Playmancer integrates open source existing systems, such as a game engine and a spoken dialog management system, extended by newly implemented components, supporting innovative interaction modalities, such as emotion recognition from audio data, motion tracking, etc, and advanced configuration tools. © 2009 International Federation for Information Processing.",doi,10.1007/978-1-4419-0221-4_52,Scopus,IFIP International Federation for Information Processing,"Kocsis O., Ganchev T., Mporas I., Papadopoulos G., Fakotakis N.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Multiagent Cooperation And Competition With Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Evolution of cooperation and competition can appear when multiple adaptive agents share a biological, social, or technological niche. In the present work we study how cooperation and competition emerge between autonomous agents that learn by reinforcement while using only their raw visual input as the state representation. In particular, we extend the Deep Q-Learning framework to multiagent environments to investigate the interaction between two learning agents in the well-known video game Pong. By manipulating the classical rewarding scheme of Pong we show how competitive and collaborative behaviors emerge. We also describe the progression from competitive to collaborative behavior when the incentive to cooperate is increased. Finally we show how learning by playing against another adaptive agent, instead of against a hard-wired algorithm, results in more robust strategies. The present work shows that Deep Q-Networks can become a useful tool for studying decentralized learning of multiagent systems coping with high-dimensional environments. © 2017 Tampuu et al.

,Network Formation Games And The Potential Function Method,"Large computer networks such as the Internet are built, operated, and used by a large number of diverse and competitive entities. In light of these competing forces, it is surprising how efficient these networks are. An exciting challenge in the area of algorithmic game theory is to understand the success of these networks in game theoretic terms: what principles of interaction lead selfish participants to form such efficient networks? In this chapter we present a number of network formation games. We focus on simple games that have been analyzed in terms of the efficiency loss that results from selfishness. We also highlight a fundamental technique used in analyzing inefficiency in many games: the potential function method. Introduction The design and operation of many large computer networks, such as the Internet, are carried out by a large number of independent service providers (Autonomous Systems), all of whom seek to selfishly optimize the quality and cost of their own operation. Game theory provides a natural framework for modeling such selfish interests and the networks they generate. These models in turn facilitate a quantitative study of the trade-off between efficiency and stability in network formation. In this chapter, we consider a range of simple network formation games that model distinct ways in which selfish agents might create and evaluate networks. © Noam Nisan, Tim Roughgarden, Éva Tardos, Vijay V.

,Neural Correlate Of Human Reciprocity In Social Interactions,"Reciprocity plays a key role maintaining cooperation in society. However, little is known about the neural process that underpins human reciprocity during social interactions. Our neuroimaging study manipulated partner identity (computer, human) and strategy (random, tit-for-tat) in repeated prisoner's dilemma games and investigated the neural correlate of reciprocal interaction with humans. Reciprocal cooperation with humans but exploitation of computers by defection was associated with activation in the left amygdala. Amygdala activation was also positively and negatively correlated with a preference change for human partners following tit-for-tat and random strategies, respectively. The correlated activation represented the intensity of positive feeling toward reciprocal and negative feeling toward non-reciprocal partners, and so reflected reciprocity in social interaction. Reciprocity in social interaction, however, might plausibly be misinterpreted and so we also examined the neural coding of insight into the reciprocity of partners. Those with and without insight revealed differential brain activation across the reward-related circuitry (i.e., the right middle dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and dorsal caudate) and theory of mind (ToM) regions [i.e., ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) and precuneus]. Among differential activations, activation in the precuneus, which accompanied deactivation of the VMPFC, was specific to those without insight into human partners who were engaged in a tit-for-tat strategy. This asymmetric (de)activation might involve specific contributions of ToM regions to the human search for reciprocity. Consequently, the intensity of emotion attached to human reciprocity was represented in the amygdala, whereas insight into the reciprocity of others was reflected in activation across the reward-related and ToM regions. This suggests the critical role of mentalizing, which was not equated with reward expectation during social interactions. © 2013 Sakaiya, Shiraito, Kato, Ide, Okada, Takano and Kansaku.",doi,10.3389/fnins.2013.00239,Scopus,Frontiers in Neuroscience,"Sakaiya S., Shiraito Y., Kato J., Ide H., Okada K., Takano K., Kansaku K.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Neural Correlates For The Suppression Of Habitual Behavior: A Functional Mri Study,"It has been suggested that inhibitory executive control of behavior is directed by the frontal lobes. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to explore the brain regions that are involved in the inhibition of habitual manual responses. Fifteen right-handed subjects performed the rock-scissors-paper game against computer-simulated pictures of hands during the scanning procedure. The subjects were required to win, lose, or draw against the presented picture in a separate block. We considered that the situation in which subjects intentionally lost the game required the suppression of habitual behavior, because it is natural behavior for people to attempt to win the game. Compared with the WIN and DRAW conditions, the left premotor and sensorimotor areas were activated for both hand sessions with a positive correlation with error rates. Importantly, the LOSE condition in the case of the right hand yielded brain activation exclusively in the anterior part of the left inferior frontal gyrus, the activity which showed a negative correlation with error rates. Overall brain activations were predominant in the left hemisphere, irrespective of the hand used for the response. The results suggest that the anterior part of the left inferior frontal gyrus plays a critical role in the inhibition of habitual manual behavior, and that the left hemisphere is dominant for the selection of well-learned manual behavior.",doi,10.1162/0898929041502643,Scopus,Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience,"Matsubara M., Yamaguchi S., Xu J., Kobayashi S.",2004,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Neural Mechanisms Of The Testosterone-Aggression Relation: The Role Of Orbitofrontal Cortex,"Testosterone plays a role in aggressive behavior, but themechanisms remain unclear. The present study tested the hypothesis that testosterone influences aggression through the OFC, a region implicated in self-regulation and impulse control. In a decision-making paradigm in which people chose between aggression and monetary reward (the ultimatum game), testosterone was associated with increased aggression following social provocation (rejecting unfair offers). The effect of testosterone on aggression was explained by reduced activity in the medial OFC. The findings suggest that testosterone increases the propensity toward aggression because of reduced activation of the neural circuitry of impulse control and self-regulation. © 2009 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",doi,10.1162/jocn.2009.21389,Scopus,Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience,"Mehta P.H., Beer J.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Neural Substrates Of Intention–Consequence Integration And Its Impact On Reactive Punishment In Interpersonal Transgression,"When evaluating interpersonal transgressions, people take into account both the consequential damage and the intention of the agent. The intention and consequence, however, do not always match, as is the case with accidents and failed attempts. We combined an interactive game and functional MRI to investigate the neural substrates underlying the processing of intention and consequence, and its bearing on reactive punishment. The participant interacted with anonymous partners, who decided to deliver pain stimulation either to himself/herself or to the participant to earn a monetary reward. In some cases, the decision was reversed by the computer. After pain delivery, the partner’s intention was revealed. Unbeknownst to the partner, the participant was then allowed to punish the partner by reducing his/her monetary reward. Behaviorally, the punishment was lower in the accidental condition (unintended harm relative to intended harm) but higher in the failed-attempt condition (unintended no-harm relative to intended no-harm). Neurally, the left amygdala/hippocampus was activated in the conditions with blameworthy intention (i.e., intentional harm and failed attempt). The accidental (relative to intentional) harm activated the right temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and the anterior inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), while the failed attempt (relative to genuine no-harm) activated the anterior insula (AI) and the posterior IFG. Effective connectivity analysis revealed that in the unintentional conditions (i.e., accidental and failed attempt) the IFG received input from the TPJ and AI, and sent regulatory signals to the amygdala. These findings demonstrate that the processing of intention may gate the emotional responses to transgression and regulate subsequent reactive punishment. © 2015 the authors.",doi,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3536-14.2015,Scopus,Journal of Neuroscience,"Yu H., Li J., Zhou X.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Neurobehavioral Test Performance In The Third National Health And Nutrition Examination Survey,"The third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) contained three computerized neurobehavioral tests from the Neurobehavioral Evaluation System (NES): simple reaction time, symbol-digit substitution and serial digit learning. The neurobehavioral data that were collected came from a nationally representative sample of adults 20-59 years old. Performance on the tests was related to sex, age, education level, family income and race-ethnicity. Performance decreased as age increased, and increased as education level and family income increased. Differences in performance between sexes, levels of education and racial-ethnic groups tended to decrease as family income increased. The relationship between age and performance on the symbol-digit substitution test varied by education level and by racial-ethnic group. The relationship between age and performance on the serial digit learning test varied by racial-ethnic group. Questionnaire variables that were related to performance on one or more of the tests included the reported amount of last night's sleep, energy level, computer or video game familiarity, alcoholic beverages within the last 3 h and effort.

,New Ocular Movement Detector System As A Communication Tool In Ventilator-Assisted Werdnig-Hoffmann Disease,"A non-contact communication system was developed for a ventilator-assisted patient with Werdnig-Hoffmann disease who had lost all voluntary movements except for those of the eye. The system detects the extraocular movements and converts them to either a 'yes' signal (produced by one lateral eyeball movement) or a 'no' signal (produced by two successive lateral eyeball movements) using a video camera placed outside the patient's visual field. The patient is thus able to concentrate on performing a task without any intrusion from the detection system. Once the setting conditions of the device have been selected, there is no need for any resetting, as the patient is unable to move his body. In addition to playing television games, the child can use the device to select television channels, compose music, and learn written Japanese and Chinese characters.

,Novel Integrative Virtual Rehabilitation Reduces Symptomatology Of Primary Progressive Aphasia - A Case Report,"Purpose: BrightBrainer™ integrative cognitive rehabilitation system evaluation in an Adult Day Program by a subject with Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA) assumed to be of the mixed nonfluent/logopenic variant, and for determination of potential benefits. Methods: The subject was a 51-year-old Caucasian male diagnosed with PPA who had attended an Adult Day Program for 18 months prior to BrightBrainer training. The subject interacted with therapeutic games using a controller that measured 3D hand movements and flexion of both index fingers. The computer simulations adapted difficulty level based on task performance; results were stored on a remote server. The clinical trial consisted of 16 sessions, twice/week for 8 weeks. The subject was evaluated through neuropsychological measures, therapy notes and caregiver feedback forms. Results: Neuropsychological testing indicated no depression (BDI 0) and severe dementia (BIMS 1 and MMSE 3). The 6.5 h of therapy consisted of games targeting Language comprehension; Executive functions; Focusing; Short-term memory; and Immediate/working memory. The subject attained the highest difficulty level in all-but-one game, while averaging 1300-arm task-oriented active movement repetitions and 320 index finger flexion movements per session. While neuropsychological testing showed no benefits, the caregiver reported strong improvements in verbal responses, vocabulary use, speaking in complete sentences, following one-step directions and participating in daily activities.

,Numerical Simulations Of Acoustic Waves With The Graphic Acceleration Gamer Code,"We present results of numerical simulations of acoustic waves with the use of the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) acceleration GAMER code which implements a second-order Godunov-type numerical scheme and adaptive mesh refinement (AMR). The AMR implementation is based on constructing a hierarchy of grid patches with an octree data structure. In this code a hybrid model is adopted, in which the time-consuming solvers are dealt with GPUs and the complex AMR data structure is manipulated by Central Processing Units (CPUs). The code is highly parallelized with the Hilbert space-filling curve method. These implementations allow us to resolve well desperate spatial scales that are associated with acoustic waves. We show that a localized velocity (gas pressure) pulse that is initially launched within a uniform and still medium triggers acoustic waves simultaneously with a vortex (an entropy mode). In a flowing medium, acoustic waves experience amplitude growth or decay, a scenario which depends on a location of the flow and relative direction of wave propagation. The amplitude growth results from instabilities which are associated with negative energy waves.",doi,10.2478/v10175-012-0091-9,Scopus,Bulletin of the Polish Academy of Sciences: Technical Sciences,"Murawski K., Murawski K., Schive H.-Y.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Nutrition Science And Behavioral Theories Integrated In A Serious Game For Adolescents,"Purpose. Serious games have demonstrated positive effects on adolescent eating and physical activity. The purpose of this paper is to describe how constructs from social cognitive theory (SCT) and self-determination theory (SDT) were operationalized in the development of the serious game CREATURE 101 (C-101) to engage players in acquiring motivation, knowledge, skills, and personal agency. Approach. C-101 was developed from an evaluated nutrition and science curriculum for middle school youth, Choice, Control & Change (C3). Its behavior change goals are three pairs of “increase/decrease” behaviors: increase water / decease sweetened beverages, increase fruit and vegetables / decrease processed snacks (chips, candy etc), and increase physical activity (light, medium, intense) / decrease recreational screen time (watching TV, playing video games for fun) through a “virtual companion care” motif where the players bring their adopted creatures back to health. increase water / decease sweetened beverages, increase fruit and vegetables / decrease processed snacks (chips, candy etc), and increase physical activity (light, medium, intense) / decrease recreational screen time (watching TV, playing video games for fun) through a “virtual companion care” motif where the players bring their adopted creatures back to health. Several procedures or strategies were used to develop the story line and activities in C-101 to address autonomy, competence and relatedness from SDT and outcome expectations, self-efficacy, and behavioral capability from SCT, constructs shown in previous studies as likely to enhance effectiveness of nutrition and physical activity interventions. Implications. This description of how the theory constructs and procedures were used to create an entertaining serious game based on an existing evaluated health-related curriculum can help game developers, curriculum developers, and educators who wish to expand existing curricula through the development and integration of games into their work. © 2015, © 2015 SAGE Publications.",doi,10.1177/1046878115577163,Scopus,Simulation and Gaming,"Majumdar D., Koch P.A., Lee Gray H., Contento I.R., de Lourdes Islas-Ramos A., Fu D.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Only Lower Limb Controlled Interactive Computer Gaming Enables An Effective Increase In Energy Expenditure,"Limited research documents if new and existing interactive computer gaming ""exergaming"" increase energy expenditure and cardio-respiratory costs comparable to common exercise modalities. To address this, healthy male volunteers (n = 15) completed six by 12-min test elements: PlayStation2 (PS2 hand), Nintendo Wii boxing, walk at 5.6 km h -1, cycle at 120 W, playing an adapted lower limb controlled PS2 (PS2 limb) and run at 9.6 km h -1. In addition, they played PS2 limb for 30 min and performed an incremental treadmill test to exhaustion. Data were analysed using repeated measures ANOVA with post hoc Tukey tests, P&lt;0.05 inferred significance. PS2 limb increased energy expenditure (EE) and post-exercise blood lactate (BLa) significantly higher (P&lt;0.001) than PS2 hand, Wii gaming or walking at 5.6 km h -1 (EE: 30.3 ± 4.9 vs. 4.7 ± 1.1, 22.0 ± 6.1 and 17.9 ± 1.9 kJ h -1 kg-1; BLa: 2.4 ± 1.5 vs. 1.0 ± 0.3, 1.8 ± 0.8 and 0.9 ± 0.2 mmol L-1), playing the PS2 limb raised mean EE over six times greater than PS2 hand. Mean fat and carbohydrate oxidation rates during the 9- to 12-min period playing the PS2 limb were five and ten times greater than PS2 hand (0.25 ± 0.10 vs. 0.05 ± 0.10, 1.69 ± 0.52 vs. 0.15 ± 0.14 g min-1, respectively). PS2 limb met ACSM guidelines for cardiovascular fitness; however, current Wii technology failed. In conclusion, gaming interactive technology must be adapted or designed to include the lower limbs in order to provide a significant exercise stimulus. © Springer-Verlag 2010.",doi,10.1007/s00421-010-1773-3,Scopus,European Journal of Applied Physiology,"Jordan M., Donne B., Fletcher D.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Only Social Feedback Reduces Age-Related Prospective Memory Deficits In Virtual Week,"Background: Prospective memory, or remembering to do things in the future, is crucial for independent living in old age. Although there is evidence of substantial age-related deficits in memory for intentions, older adults have demonstrated the ability to compensate for their deficits in everyday life. The present study investigated feedback as a strategy for facilitating prospective memory in the elderly. Method: Young and older adults played a computer-based task, Virtual Week, in which they had to remember to carry out life-like intentions. After each virtual day, specific feedback on prospective memory performance was automatically provided on the computer screen that participants either proceeded through by themselves (non-social feedback) or were taken through by an experimenter (social feedback). The control group received no feedback. Results: We found that, compared with no-feedback group, only social feedback substantially reduced the age-related deficit in prospective memory. Older adults significantly benefited from feedback provided by the experimenter on the tasks of intermediate difficulty. Unexpectedly, prospective memory with non-social feedback was not only worse than with social feedback, but it was not any better than without any feedback at all. Conclusions: The results extended previous findings on the effectiveness of feedback in improving the memory performance of older adults to include memory for intentions. Despite the feedback meeting the critical recommendations of being specific, objective, and well-targeted, it was ineffective when the feedback displayed on the computer was not introduced by the experimenter. This has implications for computerized training tasks where automated feedback is considered crucial.

,Optimising Technical Skills And Physical Loading In Small-Sided Basketball Games,"Differences in physiological, physical, and technical demands of small-sided basketball games related to the number of players, court size, and work-to-rest ratios are not well characterised. A controlled trial was conducted to compare the influence of number of players (2v2/4v4), court size (half/full court) and work-to-rest ratios (4x2.5 min/2x5 min) on the demands of small-sided games. Sixteen elite male and female junior players (aged 15-19 years) completed eight variations of a small-sided game in randomised order over a six-week period. Heart rate responses and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) were measured to assess the physiological load. Movement patterns and technical elements were assessed by video analysis. There were ~60% more technical elements in 2v2 and ~20% more in half court games. Heart rate (86 ± 4% & 83 ± 5% of maximum; mean ± SD) and RPE (8 ± 2 & 6 ± 2; scale 1-10) were moderately higher in 2v2 than 4v4 small-sided games, respectively. The 2v2 format elicited substantially more sprints (36 ±12%; mean ±90% confidence limits) and high intensity shuffling (75 ±17%) than 4v4. Full court games required substantially more jogging (9 ±6%) compared to half court games. Fewer players in small-sided basketball games substantially increases the technical, physiological and physical demands. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",doi,10.1080/02640414.2012.712714,Scopus,Journal of Sports Sciences,"Klusemann M.J., Pyne D.B., Foster C., Drinkwater E.J.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Orders To Shoot (A Camera): Effects Of Ostracism On Obedience,"Research suggests that ostracism increases susceptibility to indirect forms of social influence (e.g., conformity). Yet, no study to date has explored whether the effects of ostracism extend to the most direct form of social influence - obedience. We investigated whether ostracized individuals would be more likely to obey a direct command to do something effortful in uncomfortable conditions. Participants (N = 62) were randomly assigned to be included or ostracized in Cyberball, or assigned to a control condition. They were then approached by the experimenter and commanded to go outside when temperatures were below 30°F and take 39 unique and creative photographs in the cold of winter. Ostracized participants were more likely to obey the experimenters command to be creative when taking photographs. No differences in obedience emerged between the inclusion and the control condition. We provided evidence completing the social influence ""trifecta"": ostracism increases susceptibility to conformity, compliance, and now, obedience. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",doi,10.1080/00224545.2014.883354,Scopus,Journal of Social Psychology,"Riva P., Williams K.D., Torstrick A.M., Montali L.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Orienting-Defense Responses And Psychophysiological Reactivity In Isolated Clinic Versus Sustained Hypertension,"This study sought to determine whether patients with white-coat or isolated clinic hypertension (ICH) show, in comparison to patients with sustained hypertension (SH), a defense response pattern to novel stimuli and an enhanced psychophysiological reactivity to stress. Forty-three patients with essential hypertension were divided into two groups after 16 days of self-monitoring blood pressure (BP): ICH (24 men; self-measured BP < 135/85 mmHg) and SH (19 men; self-measured BP ≥ 135/85 mmHg). Defense responses were measured as the cardiac changes to phasic non-aversive auditory stimuli. Psychophysiological reactivity (heart and breath rate, blood volume pulse, electromyography, and skin conductance) was measured during mental arithmetic and video game tasks. The standard deviation of self-measured BPs and the difference between mean BPs at work and at home were used as indicators of cardiovascular reactivity to daily stress. No significant differences were seen in defense responses or psychophysiological reactivity to laboratory or naturally occurring stressors. These results do not support the hypothesis that ICH can be explained in terms of a generalized hyperreactivity to novel or stressful stimuli.

,Parasympathetic Nervous System Control Of Heart Rate Responses To Stress In Offspring Of Hypertensives,"The elevated heart rate response to stress in normotensive offspring of hypertensives (PH+) has been suggested to be a function of sympathetic nervous system activity. This study examined whether parasympathetic nervous system activity may also underlie familial differences in the heart rate response. Twenty‐four subjects, half of whom were PH+, were exposed to four stressor tasks administered in counterbalanced order. Stressors were chosen based on previous research that suggested vagal contributions to the heart rate response. Stressors were a cold pack to the forehead, isometric hand grip, a noxious film, and a shock‐avoidance video game task. Physiological measures included heart rate (HR), respiration rate (RR), and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). RSA values were corrected for corresponding RR by analysis of covariance. Familial differences in HR were observed in response to the hand grip and video game tasks. However, in both cases analyses suggest that familial differences in reactivity were a function of primarily sympathetic as opposed to parasympathetic influences. Familial differences in RSA were not observed for rest or tasks. This study found no evidence for parasympathetic mediation of familial differences in the heart rate response to the stressors employed. Copyright © 1994, Wiley Blackwell.

,Perception Of The Prosody And Content Of Sentences In An Unfamiliar Language In Children With Autism Spectrum Disorders,"Prior research suggests that children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) show atypical patterns of attention to the prosody (intonation and emotional tone of voice) and content (words) of spoken sentences. Using a discrimination-choice procedure embedded in a custom-made videogame, we examined attention to these features of sentences in 15 children with ASD (ages 5 years, 5 months-18 years) and 15 age-matched typical controls (TYP). Using an unfamiliar language (German) to remove semantics, we assessed the role of meaning in promoting attention to content over prosody. As in a previous study with English sentences, TYP children attended to content to a greater extent than children with ASD while maintaining equivalent levels of discrimination based on prosody. However, in contrast to previous results, TYP children did not show a preference for enthusiastic over grouchy tone of voice, which suggests that the unfamiliar language rendered affective valence less salient. The results confirm intact perception of prosody in children with ASD, and a more selective pattern of attention to content in TYP children. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.rasd.2014.03.014,Scopus,Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders,"Ploog B.O., Brooks P.J., Scharf A., Aum S.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Persistent Affective Biases In Human Amygdala Response Following Implicit Priming With Negative Emotion Concepts,"To what extent do past experiences shape our behaviors, perceptions, and thoughts even without explicit knowledge of these influences? Behavioral research has demonstrated that various cognitive processes can be influenced by conceptual representations implicitly primed during a preceding and unrelated task. Here we investigated whether emotion processing might also be influenced by prior incidental exposure to negative semantic material and which neural substrates would mediate these effects. During a first (priming) task, participants performed a variant of the hangman game with either negative or neutral emotion-laden words. Subsequently, they performed a second, unrelated visual task with fearful and neutral faces presented at attended or unattended locations. Participants were generally not aware of any relationships between the two tasks. We found that priming with emotional words enhanced amygdala sensitivity to faces in the subsequent visual task, while decreasing discriminative responses to threat. Furthermore, the magnitude of the induced bias in behavior and amygdala activation was predicted by the effectiveness of semantic access observed in the priming task. This demonstrates that emotional processing can be modulated by implicit influence of environmental information processed at an earlier time, independently of volitional control. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",doi,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.06.004,Scopus,NeuroImage,"Pichon S., Rieger S.W., Vuilleumier P.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia

The current study examined the contributions of gender and personality, exposure to physical abuse and violence in the family, and exposure to media violence in both television and in video games on violent criminal activity. Data from young adults (n = 355) indicated that personality characteristics and direct physical abuse significantly predicted violent crime. Exposure to television and video game violence were not significant predictors of violent crime. These results elucidate the complex interplay between multiple factors related to the etiology of violent crime. These results also call into question the belief that media violence is involved in the etiology of violent crime.",doi,10.1080/10926770802471522,anderson2010,"Journal of Aggression, Maltreatment & Trauma","Ferguson, C.

,"Personality, Psychopathology And Developmental Issues In Male Adolescent Video Game Use.","This paper presents an empirical study of the relationship of heavy video game use in adolescent male subjects to personality and psychopathological factors. Based on the nature of the games and on developmental theory, it was hypothesized that heavy video game use plays a role in managing developmental conflicts, particularly with regard to the discharge of aggression and the open expression of competition, and does not result in increased neuroticism, social withdrawal, or escape into fantasy. Heavy video game users were also hypothesized to have lower frustration tolerance. A study of 208 adolescent male subjects supported these hypotheses. The results were discussed in terms of the need for mastery of experiences, and in terms of the reawakening of Oedipal conflicts in adolescence as described by Blos. It was stressed that much of the anxiety about video games represents a parental issue, akin to parental overreactions to other adolescent outlets.",doi,10.1016/S0002-7138(09)61094-3,anderson2010,Journal of the American Academy of Child Psychiatry,"Kestenbaum, G.

,Pharmacologic And Tracer Methods To Study Sympathetic Function In Primary Hypertension,"Systemically infused tritiated norepinephrine (NE) was used to estimate total body NE spillover into arterial blood during mental challenge (playing a video game) in 18 young (mean age 35 years old) patients with essential hypertension and 20 normotensives of similar age. Arterial NE, epinephrine (E), and total body NE spillover at baseline did not differ between the groups. During the game, total body NE spillover increased significantly in both groups, with the increments related directly to the pressor responses. Mean increments in total body NE spillover, arterial E, and mean arterial pressure were larger in the hypertensives (204 vs 91 ng/min, 33 vs 9 pg/ml, and 16 vs 12 mm Hg). The hypertensives increased total peripheral resistance during the game, whereas the normotensive group did not. Intravenous administration of yohimbine was used to increase NE spillover. Pressor responses to yohimbine were related to responses of arterial NE. The hypertensive group had a larger mean increment in blood pressure and arterial NE than did the normotensive group during yohimbine, due to excessive responses in a subgroup of about 1/3 of the patients. Patients with essential hypertension can have excessive sympathoadrenomedullary responsiveness related to excessive pressor responses, even when sympathoadrenomedullary activity at rest is normal. © 1989 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.",doi,10.3109/10641968909045422,Scopus,Clinical and Experimental Hypertension,"Goldstein D.S., Eisenhofer G., Garty M., Sax F.L., Keiser H.R., Kopin I.J., Folio C.J., Stull R., Chidakel B.",1989,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,"Physical Activity, Sedentary Behaviors, And Retinal Vascular Caliber In Children And Adolescents With Type 1 Diabetes","Purpose: The aimof this study was to investigate associations of physical activity and sedentary behaviors with retinal vascular caliber in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. Design: This was a hospital-based cross-sectional study. Methods: A study of 122 children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes was conducted over an 8-month period. Self-reported physical activity time and time spent watching TVor playing computer or video games were obtained using interviewer-Administered questionnaires. Retinal vascular caliber was measured by a trained grader using a standardized protocol and later summarized as central retinal artery equivalent (CRAE) and central retinal vein equivalent (CRVE) using a semiautomated computer program. Results: After adjusting for confounders (age, sex, ethnicity, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, HbA1c, maternal smoking status, age at which cow'smilk was introduced, and CRVE/CRAE, respectively), narrower CRAE was independently related to more time spent playing computer/ video games [ExpB = -3.85; 95% confidence interval (CI), -6.41 to -1.29; P = 0.004], whereas wider CRVE was independently related to lower physical activity level (ExpB = -1.08; 95% CI, -2.01 to -0.15; P = 0.03) and more time spent playing computer/video games (ExpB = 4.72; 95% CI, 0.52-8.92; P = 0.02). Television viewing time was not associated with retinal vascular caliber after adjustment. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that physical activity and sedentary behaviors in the form of ""screen viewing time"" are associated with retinal vessel caliber early in life. These results suggest that retinal vascular caliber may provide prognostic information beyond current traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Future longitudinal and interventional studies are warranted to evaluate the relevance of these observations.

,"Physical Demands Of Elite Rugby League Referees, Part Two: Heart Rate Responses And Implications For Training And Fitness Testing","The purpose of this study was to assess whether any characteristic patterns of heart rate (HR) responses could be identified in National Rugby League (NRL) referees (n= 6) during matches played in the 2001 season. The data have been plotted and discussed, in order that exercise program planning practitioners may gain improved understandings of the physiological requirements for referees. Some specific training suggestions have also been made. Methods: The HR was recorded every five seconds throughout six competition NRL matches; using a heart rate monitor with a built-in memory. Results: The specific magnitudes of referees' HR mean values varied between individuals, possibly due to specific game intensities, referee fitness, and age. All referees however exhibited similar HR response patterns; characterised by frequent (13-20 per match) large transient upward and downward shifts (&gt;20 beats.minute-1). Periods of elevated HR extended for between five sec and eight min at a time, and were further characterised as a typical cyclic wave of HR elevation and recovery (ranging from 99.2±12.4 beats.minute-1 to 176.5±11.8 beats.minute-1 [mean ±95% CI]), with a work to rest ratio of 2:1. Steady state HR was not achieved at any time during any match. Conclusions: The findings of the present study, taken together with a recent motion analysis, indicate that Rugby League refereeing is a highly intermittent, variable intensity activity. Significant anaerobic contribution to performance appears likely. It is suggested that training and fitness assessment of athletes should reflect their specific demands; some specific recommendations have therefore been provided.",doi,10.1016/S1440-2440(04)80006-9,Scopus,Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport,"Kay B., Gill N.D.",2004,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,"Physical Effort, Energy Expenditure, And Motivation In Structured And Unstructured Active Video Games: A Randomized Controlled Trial","Purpose. The goals of the study were: a) to compare the way that two types of active video games (AVG) influenced physical effort and motivation in young adults; b) to compare direct and indirect instruments and use an indirect instrument (heart rate analysis) as a practical tool to verify physical effort in AVGs. Methods. Initially, 16 healthy but physically inactive young adult males with no AVGs experience took part in the randomized control trial. After the baseline assessments of blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and aerobic capacity (AE), the participants were randomized into two groups: structured AVG (n = 6) and unstructured AVG (n = 7) (3 dropouts). They played 3 sessions a week, during 6 weeks. Direct and indirect metabolic measurements were made. To compare direct and indirect AE, Student t-test was used for related samples. Changes (group × time) in HR, perceived exertion (PE), calculated energy expenditure (EE), calculated metabolic equivalent (MET), and motivation (points) were assessed with the two-way analysis of variance. Results. There were no differences between direct and indirect AE (36.0 ± 5.2 vs 33.9 ± 6.0 ml/kg/min: unstructured; 39.0 ± 5.9 vs 37.7 ± 5.9 ml/kg/min; p > 0.05). No differences were observed in maximal HR, PE, or motivation (p > 0.05). Statistically significant differences referred to average HR, MET, and EE over the sessions (p < 0.05).

,Physio-Behavioral Coupling In A Cooperative Team Task: Contributors And Relations,"Research indicates that coactors performing cooperative tasks often exhibit spontaneous and unintended similarities in their physiological and behavioral responses-a phenomenon referred to here as physiobehavioral coupling (PBC). The purpose of this research was to identify contributors to PBC; examine relationships between PBC, team performance, and perceived team attributes (e.g., cohesion, trust); and compare a set of time-series measures(cross-correlation [CC], cross-recurrence quantification analysis [CRQA], and cross-fuzzy entropy [CFEn]) in their characterization of PBC across comparisons. To accomplish this, PBC was examined in human postural sway (PS) and cardiac interbeat intervals (IBIs) from dyadic teams performing a fast-paced puzzle task (Quadra-a variant of the video game Tetris). Results indicated that observed levels of PBC were not a chance occurrence, but instead driven by features of the team-task environment, and that PBC was likely influenced by similar individual task demands and interpersonal coordination dynamics that were not ""unique"" to a particular team. Correlation analysis revealed that PBC exhibited negative relationships with team performance and team attributes, which were interpreted to reflect complementary coordination (as opposed to mimicry) during task performance, potentially due to differentiated team roles. Finally, qualitative comparison of timeseries measures used to characterize PBC indicated that CRQA percent recurrence and CFEn (both nonlinear measures) settled on mostly analogous characterizations, whereas linear CC did not. The disparity observed between the linear and nonlinear measures highlights underlying computational and interpretational differences between the two families of statistics and supports the use of multiple metrics for characterizing PBC. © 2013 American Psychological Association.",doi,10.1037/a0033125,Scopus,Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance,"Strang A.J., Funke G.J., Russell S.M., Dukes A.W., Middendorf M.S.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Physiologic Responses And Energy Expenditure Of Kinect Active Video Game Play In Schoolchildren,"Objective: To evaluate the physiologic responses and energy expenditure of active video gaming using Kinect for the Xbox 360. Design: Comparison study. Setting: Kirkby Sports College Centre for Learning, Liverpool, England. Participants: Eighteen schoolchildren (10 boys and 8 girls) aged 11 to 15 years. Main Exposure: A comparison of a traditional sedentary video game and 2 Kinect activity-promoting video games, Dance Central and Kinect Sports Boxing, each played for 15 minutes. Physiologic responses and energy expenditure were measured using a metabolic analyzer. Main Outcome Measures: Heart rate, oxygen uptake, and energy expenditure. Results: Heart rate, oxygen uptake, and energy expenditure were considerably higher (P &lt; .05) during activity-promoting video game play compared with rest and sedentary video game play. The mean (SD) corresponding oxygen uptake values for the sedentary, dance, and boxing video games were 6.1(1.3), 12.8(3.3), and 17.7(5.1) mL·min -1·kg-1, respectively. Energy expenditures were 1.5 (0.3), 3.0(1.0), and 4.4(1.6) kcal·min-1, respectively. Conclusions: Dance Central and Kinect Sports Boxing increased energy expenditure by 150% and 263%, respectively, above resting values and were 103% and 194% higher than traditional video gaming. This equates to an increased energy expenditure of up to 172 kcal·h-1 compared with traditional sedentary video game play.

,Physiological And Psychophysiological Responses To An Exer-Game Training Protocol,"Objectives: Exer-games and virtual reality offer alternative opportunities to provide neuro-rehabilitation and exercise that are fun. Our goal was to determine how effective they are in achieving motor learning goals and fitness benefits as players gain experience. Design: We employed a repeated measures design to determine changes in physical exertion and engagement with training. Methods: Fourteen healthy adults trained on the XBOX Kinect video game Dance Central using a skill-based protocol to examine changes in energy expenditure (EE), heart rate (HR), METs, limb movement, game proficiency, and player engagement in initial, post-training, and transfer-testing of a full-body dance exer-game. Data were analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance, p < 0.05. Results: Both EE, HR, and METs increased from initial (EE 4.89 ± 1.35, HR 103 ± 18, METs 4.25 ± 0.72) to post-training (EE 5.92 ± 1.25, HR 110 ± 15, METs 5.05 ± 0.75) and were greatest during transfer-testing (EE 6.34 ± 1.35, HR 115 ± 17, METs 5.42 ± 0.88, p ≤ 0.001). Proficiency, measured by game scores, also increased from initial to post-training and transfer-testing (≤ 0.002). Limb movement and player engagement remained unchanged. Conclusions: It is important to understand whether player physiological and psychophysiological responses change with continued game-play. Although Dance Central involves whole-body movement, physical exertion remained at moderate levels after training. As exer-game and virtual reality systems move from their initial novelty, research about how players react to continued involvement with a game can guide game developers to maintain a freshness through game progression that preserves the participant's attentional focus, minimizes attrition and maintains a prescribed level of energy exertion. © 2015 Sports Medicine Australia.",doi,10.1016/j.jsams.2015.03.003,Scopus,Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport,"Bronner S., Pinsker R., Naik R., Noah J.A.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia

Gamers were identified as addicted using the Addiction-Engagement Questionnaire. Sensation seeking was measured using the Arnett Inventory of Sensation Seeking. Results: Addicted MMORPG gamers (n = 16) displayed significant decreases in cardiovascular activity during gaming compared to baseline and showed significant increases after gaming. Addicted FPS gamers (n = 13) had significant increases in BP during gaming which decreased significantly after gaming. In comparison, non-addicted MMORPG gamers (n = 14) had significant decreases in HR during gaming, whereas BP in non-addicted MMORPG and FPS gamers (n = 17) increased during gaming and after gaming. There were no significant relationships between sensation seeking and addiction. Conclusion: There are physiological arousal deficits in addicted gamers, and these patterns differ according to the genre of game played. Copyright © 2013 S.

,Physiological Responses During Exercise With Video Games In Patients With Cystic Fibrosis: A Systematic Review.,"Interactive video games are recently being used as an exercise tool in cystic fibrosis (CF). This study aimed to assess the literature describing whether video games generate a physiological response similar to the exercise intensity needed for training in CF. An online search in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, SciELO, LILACS and PEDro databases was conducted and original studies describing physiological responses of the use of video games as exercise in CF were included. In four, out of five studies, the heart rate achieved during video games was within the standards recommended for training (60-80%). Two studies assessed VO2 and showed higher levels compared to the six-minute walk test. No desaturation was reported. Most games were classified as moderate intensity. Only one study used a maximum exercise test as comparator. Interactive video games generate a heart rate response similar to the intensity required for training in CF patients.",doi,10.1016/j.rmed.2016.08.011,pubmed,Respiratory medicine,"Carbonera, Raquel Pinto; Vendrusculo, Fernanda Maria; Donadio, Márcio Vinícius Fagundes",2016,NA,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,"Play Pattern Of Seated Video Game And Active ""Exergame"" Alternatives","The purpose of the study was to compare the play pattern of "" exergames"" and seated internet-based video games between boys and girls. Seventy-nine participants (40 boys, 39 girls) aged 9 to 12 years (M = 10.85 ± 0.9) were involved in two 1-hour video game sessions. Play pattern in terms of frequency, duration and intensity were assessed from observation, accelerometry and heart rate monitoring. Results indicated that children spent half of the available time playing the activity-promoting exergames (XaviX bowling 47.6 ± 14.9%; XaviX J-Mat 48.8 ± 12.8%). No differences between the boys and girls were apparent for total time played, number of play bouts or duration per bout (p ≥ 0.05). Boys however played both exergames more actively than the girls (XaviX bowling RT3 counts.s-1: boys 10.47 ± 4.71, girls 6.34 ± 2.76; XaviX J-Mat RT3 counts·s-1: boys 66.37 ± 13.84, girls 51.94 ± 17.83). This study concludes that both boys and girls choose to play exergames for similar periods of time, but play style during the XaviX bowling was often inactive in the girls and during the XaviX J-Mat less active in the girls than the boys. Reasons underlying choice of play was similar between the girls and boys. Active video games appear to be suitable for longer-term physical activity interventions in children, but attention will need to be given to the intensity of game play in girls. © 2011 Chinese Taipei Society of Ultrasound in Medicine &amp; Elsevier.",doi,10.1016/S1728-869X(11)60003-8,Scopus,Journal of Exercise Science and Fitness,"Lam J.W.K., Sit C.H.P., McManus A.M.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,"Playing Violent Electronic Games, Hostile Attributional Style, And Aggression-Related Norms In German Adolescents.","The relationship was examined between exposure to and preference for violent electronic games and aggressive norms as well as hostile attributional style. Following a pilot study to sample widely used electronic games varying in violent content, 231 eighth-grade adolescents in Germany reported their use of and attraction to violent electronic games. They also completed measures of hostile attributional style and endorsement of aggressive norms. There were significant gender differences in usage and attraction to violent electronic games, with boys scoring higher than girls. Significant relationships were found between attraction to violent electronic games and the acceptance of norms condoning physical aggression. Violent electronic games were linked indirectly to hostile attributional style through aggressive norms.

,"Pleasure To Play, Arousal To Stay: The Effect Of Player Emotions On Digital Game Preferences And Playing Time","This study investigated how player emotions during game-play, measured through self-report and physiological recordings, predict playing time and game preferences. We distinguished between short-term (immediately after game-play) and long-term (after 3 weeks) playing time and game preferences. While pleasure was most predictive for short-term playing time and game preferences, arousal, particularly for game preferences, was most predictive on the longer term. This result was found through both self-report and physiological emotion measures.

,Predictors Of Future Ambulatory Blood Pressure In Youth,"Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the predictors of future ambulatory blood pressure in normotensive youths with family histories of essential hypertension. Study design: Eighty-eight healthy youths (mean age 10.9 ± 2.5 years; 52 blacks, 36 whites; 45 boys) were studied. During an initial visit anthropometric variables and hemodynamics were measured at rest and before, during, and after three laboratory stressors: postural change, forehead cold, and video game challenge. The subjects' ambulatory blood pressure was monitored for 24 hours as part of a follow-up evaluation an average of 2.5 years later. Results: Anthropometric and demographic variables and measures of reactivity to laboratory stressors were related to future daytime and nighttime ambulatory blood pressure. Conclusion: These findings provide important information on the predictors of ambulatory blood pressure and underscore the importance of resting blood pressure and adiposity.

,Preferences For Individual Video Games As A Function Of Their Emotional Effects On Players,"Video games vary in terms of the emotional states they elicit from players. These differences in emotional reactions, in turn, help account for differential preferences of individual games. The three independent dimensions of pleasure‐displeasure, arousal‐nonarousal, and dominance‐submissiveness were used to assess emotional impacts of individual games. In addition, a preference measure was constructed to evaluate attraction toward, versus avoidance of, specific games. In Study One, a group of subjects provided data on emotional responses to 22 common arcade video games and a different group rated their preferences for the same games. The emotional impact of video games was highly unpleasant, moderately arousing, and moderately dominance‐inducing; thus, the predominant emotional response to these games was aggression, anger, or hostility. I n Study Two, subjects visiting a video game arcade were recruited and assigned to play two games each and to report their reactions to each game immediately after playing the game. Results showed that greater feelings of pleasure, and separately of arousal, while playing video games resulted in higher preferences for the games and that greater dominance (significant only for males) also led to higher preferences. It may be beneficial, therefore, to experiment with more arousing and more dominance‐inducing game designs which are not necessarily unpleasant or which definitely yield high pleasure.

,Presence And Emotions In Playing A Group Game In A Virtual Environment: The Influence Of Body Participation,"This study assesses the influence of body participation on the sense of presence and emotions, and the relationship between the two dependent variables in playing a group game in a virtual environment. A total of 56 volunteers were asked to play a virtual game in a 360-degree stereoscopic immersive interactive visualization environment using either body movement or a joystick. Presence was measured with the post hoc SUS Presence Questionnaire. The pictorial tool of Self-Assessment Manikin was employed for measuring emotions of arousal and valence. Both arousal and valence positively correlated with presence. However, body participation did not significantly affect reported presence or the above-mentioned emotions.

,Propulsion Technique And Anaerobic Work Capacity In Elite Wheelchair Athletes: Cross-Sectional Analysis,"Wheelchair sports and daily manual wheelchair propulsion are dominated by frequent short-term power demands. The purpose of the current cross- sectional study was to determine the variation in propulsion technique in association with sprint power production among elite wheelchair athletes. Therefore, 67 wheelchair athletes (different impairment; 17 female and 50 male athletes; age, 29.1 ± 7 yr; body weight, 60.7 ± 11.8 kg; training hours, 12.9 ± 6.4 h · wk-1; VO2 (peak) 1.7 ± 0.7 liter · min-1; aerobic power output, 72.2 ± 36.7 W) were studied during the World Championships and Games for the Disabled in Assen (1990) on propulsion technique and anaerobic work capacity in a 30-s sprint test on a computer controlled wheelchair ergometer. Mean power output (P30) (97 ± 45.8 w; range, 8.3-195.3 W) and heart rate (158.6 ± 23.6 b · min-1) were highly variable and seemed associated with impairment level: track athletes, classified in four different functional classes, showed a class-related P30 of 23, 68, 100, and 138 W for the male athletes (n = 38). Sprint power relative to body weight varied between 0.36 W · kg BW-1 ± 0.04 and 1.85 W · kg BW-1 ± 0.43 for the different subject groups. Propulsion technique in terms of forces applied to the rim and timing showed significant differences between subject groups for the majority of parameters studied. Apart from the mediolateral force and the negative dip at the start of the push phase, the technique parameters were significantly related to power production. Fraction effective force, the ratio between the total force vector and the effective force applied to the hand rim, appeared low on average (especially for subjects with cerebral palsy and those with a high spinal lesion) but showed a significant correlation with power output (r = 0.5). In general, propulsion technique parameters were related to both performance and functionality. The number of training hours showed a small but significant relation with peak power (r = 0.31), peak torque (r = 0.4), the amount of work per push (r = 0.41) and total force vector (r = 0.31), stressing the role of training status, next to disability, as important mediating factor in both propulsion technique as well as performance capacity. No association between training hours and fraction effective force was seen. It can be concluded that propulsion technique and performance parameters are highly variable among wheelchair athletes. Also, propulsion technique is strongly associated with functionality and training hours and does clearly relate to performance. The current results on technique and performance and their possible causal relationship, but also with impairment and sports discipline, must be further substantiated in a longitudinal study design.The variation in propulsion technique in association with sprint power production among elite wheelchair athletes was examined. Sixty-seven athletes were studied during the World Championships and Games for the Disabled in Assen on propulsion technique and anaerobic work capacity in a 30-s sprint test on a computer controlled wheelchair ergometer. It is shown that propulsion technique parameters are related to both performance and functionality. This suggests that propulsion technique and performance parameters are highly variable among wheelchair athletes.

,Protection Motivation Theory And Social Distancing Behaviour In Response To A Simulated Infectious Disease Epidemic,"Epidemics of respiratory infectious disease remain one of the most serious health risks facing the population. Non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g. hand-washing or wearing face masks) can have a significant impact on the course of an infectious disease epidemic. The current study investigated whether protection motivation theory (PMT) is a useful framework for understanding social distancing behaviour (i.e. the tendency to reduce social contacts) in response to a simulated infectious disease epidemic. There were 230 participants (109 males, 121 females, mean age 32.4 years) from the general population who completed self-report measures assessing the components of PMT. In addition, participants completed a computer game which simulated an infectious disease epidemic in order to provide a measure of social distancing behaviour. The regression analyses revealed that none of the PMT variables were significant predictors of social distancing behaviour during the simulation task. However, fear (β =.218, p <.001), response efficacy (β =.175, p <.01) and self-efficacy (β =.251, p <.001) were all significant predictors of intention to engage in social distancing behaviour. Overall, the PMT variables (and demographic factors) explain 21.2% of the variance in intention. The findings demonstrated that PMT was a useful framework for understanding intention to engage in social distancing behaviour, but not actual behaviour during the simulated epidemic. These findings may reflect an intention-behaviour gap in relation to social distancing behaviour. © 2015 Taylor and Francis.",doi,10.1080/13548506.2015.1028946,Scopus,"Psychology, Health and Medicine","Williams L., Rasmussen S., Kleczkowski A., Maharaj S., Cairns N.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Psychophysiological Responses In Women Reporting Severe Premenstrual Symptoms,"Sixteen women attending a Premenstrual Tension Clinic and eight control women were tested experimentally in the premenstrual and postmenstrual phases with assessments of heart rate, skin conductance level, and neck electromyogram during rest, relaxation, an emotionally upsetting film, and performance of mental arithmetic and video game tasks. All participants completed daily symptom assessments for two menstrual cycles prior to the study. The clinic attenders were divided into eight (Clinic+) who showed marked increases in symptoms premenstrually, and eight (Clinic-) who recorded only modest changes in symptom severity across the menstrual cycle. There were no marked differences in resting autonomic activity. During relaxation, skin conductance level decreased to a greater extent in the premenstrual than in the postmenstrual phase, while neck electromyogram showed the reverse pattern. Heart rate reactions to the mental arithmetic and video game tasks were smaller in the premenstrual than in the postmenstrual phase in Controls and Clinic- groups, but not in the Clinic+ group.

,Psychosocial Factors Affecting Psychosomatic Symptoms In Japanese Schoolchildren,"Background: In a previous study we reported the prevalence of psychosomatic symptoms in 1619 Osaka elementary schoolchildren using our original general health questionnaire assessed by their parents. We found that psychosomatic symptoms were increasing with age. This study was designed to investigate psychosocial factors responsible for increasing psychosomatic symptoms with age. Methods: We calculated a correlation coefficient between the physical complaints score (PCS) and these psychosocial variables using quantitation I of multiple regression analysis separately in the older (10-12 years, n = 860) and the younger age group (7-9 years, n = 759). Results: A stronger relationship between PCS and psychosocial problems was found in the older (r = 0.719, P < 0.0001) than in the younger age group (r=0.570, P < 0.0001). Further analysis demonstrated that difficulties in school performance and increasing psychological conflicts with human relationships were major causes of somatic complaints in the older age group. In the younger age group, however, immaturity of social skills seems to be a primary problem. In addition, poor parental interaction and the playing of computer games were found to increase somatic complaints in children. Conclusion: Children in the older age reflect the closer bio-psycho-socio interaction compared with their younger counterparts. This may give rise to a high incidence of psychosomatic disorders and school refusal in Japanese children. We emphasize that psychological support by parents in daily life is necessary to reduce psychosomatic symptoms in children.",doi,10.1046/j.1442-200X.2000.01243.x,Scopus,Pediatrics International,"Tanaka H., Tamai H., Terashima S., Takenaka Y., Tanaka T.",2e3,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Quantum Decision-Maker,"A quantum device simulating human decision making process is introduced. It consists of quantum recurrent nets generating stochastic processes which represent the motor dynamics, and of classical neural nets describing evolution of probabilities of these processes which represent the mental dynamics. The autonomy of the decision making process is achieved by a feedback from mental to motor dynamics which changes the stochastic matrix based upon the probability distributions. This feedback replaces an unavailable external information by an internal knowledgebase stored in the mental model in the form of probability distributions. As a result, the coupled motor-mental dynamics is described by a nonlinear version of Markov chains which can decrease entropy without an external source of information. Applications to common sense based decisions as well as to evolutionary games are discussed.",doi,10.1016/S0020-0255(00)00053-0,Scopus,Information sciences,Zak M.,2e3,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Real-Time Detection Of Workload Changes Using Heart Rate Variability,"This work presents a novel approach to detecting real-time changes in workload using heart rate variability (HRV). We propose that for a given workload state, the values of HRV vary in a sub-range of a Gaussian distribution. We describe methods to monitor a HRV signal in real-time for change points based upon sub-Gaussian fitting. We tested our method on subjects sitting at a computer performing a low workload surveillance task and a high workload video game task. The proposed algorithm showed superior performance compared to the classic CUSUM method for detecting task changes. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

,Recognizing Jump Patterns With Physics-Based Validation In Human Moving Trajectory,"This paper presents an approach to recognize jump patterns in human moving trajectory, differentiating jump tracks from planar moving tracks. Since human moving trajectory is one of the most informative representations for content understanding and event detection, trajectory-based video analysis has been gaining popularity. However, a jump action typically leads to violent change in human moving trajectory, since the person suddenly leaves the original plane on which he/she has been moving. The abnormal tracks of the trajectory would influence the performance of trajectory-based video analysis. Hence, differentiating jump tracks from planar moving tracks is of vital importance, not to mention that jump actions typically imply significant events, especially in sports games. In this paper, volleyball videos are used as case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed jump pattern recognition approach. We derive player trajectory by head tracking, analyze the movement of each player, and recognize potential jump tracks in player trajectories based on two important characteristics: (1) jumps cause pulse-like tracks in the trajectory and (2) the extensions of such tracks go through the vanishing point of vertical lines in the scenes. Finally, the jump positions/heights are estimated, in addition to the planar moving trajectory of each player on the court ground. The experiments show that satisfactory results can be obtained with the proposed recognition scheme. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

,Reducing Social Stress Elicits Emotional Contagion Of Pain In Mouse And Human Strangers,"Empathy for another's physical pain has been demonstrated in humans [1] and mice [2]; in both species, empathy is stronger between familiars. Stress levels in stranger dyads are higher than in cagemate dyads or isolated mice [2, 3], suggesting that stress might be responsible for the absence of empathy for the pain of strangers. We show here that blockade of glucocorticoid synthesis or receptors for adrenal stress hormones elicits the expression of emotional contagion (a form of empathy) in strangers of both species. Mice and undergraduates were tested for sensitivity to noxious stimulation alone and/or together (dyads). In familiar, but not stranger, pairs, dyadic testing was associated with increased pain behaviors or ratings compared to isolated testing. Pharmacological blockade of glucocorticoid synthesis or glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors enabled the expression of emotional contagion of pain in mouse and human stranger dyads, as did a shared gaming experience (the video game Rock Band) in human strangers. Our results demonstrate that emotional contagion is prevented, in an evolutionarily conserved manner, by the stress of a social interaction with an unfamiliar conspecific and can be evoked by blocking the endocrine stress response. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd",doi,10.1016/j.cub.2014.11.028,Scopus,Current Biology,"Martin L.J., Hathaway G., Isbester K., Mirali S., Acland E.L., Niederstrasser N., Slepian P.M., Trost Z., Bartz J.A., Sapolsky R.M., Sternberg W.F., Levitin D.J., Mogil J.S.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia

,Relationship Between Screen Time And Metabolic Syndrome In Adolescents,"Background: The primary objective was to determine the dose-response relation between screen time (television + computer) and the metabolic syndrome (MetS) in adolescents. Methods: The study sample included 1803 adolescents (12-19 years) from the 1999-04 US National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. Average daily screen time (combined television, computer and video game use) was self-reported. MetS was defined according to adolescent criteria linked to the adult criteria of the National Cholesterol Education Program (≥3 of high triglycerides, high fasting glucose, high waist circumference, high blood pressure and low HDL cholesterol). Results: After adjustment for relevant covariates, the odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for MetS increased in a dose-response manner (Ptrend &lt; 0.01) across ≤1 h/day (1.00, referent), 2 h/day (1.21, 0.54-2.73), 3 h/day (2.16, 0.99-4.74), 4 h/day (1.73, 0.72-4.17) and ≥5 h/day (3.07, 1.48-6.34) screen time categories. Physical activity had a minimal impact on the relation between screen time and MetS. Conclusions: Screen time was associated with an increased likelihood of MetS in a dose-dependent manner independent of physical activity. These findings suggest that lifestyle-based public health interventions for youth should include a specific component aimed at reducing screen time. © The Author 2008, Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Faculty of Public Health.

,Relevance Of Videogames In The Learning And Development Of Young Children,"Introduction. The study was carried out with children of 2nd, 4th and 6th grades of elementary school in order to explore what and how will children learn from a completely new videogame. Method. We organized children from 2nd, 4th and 6th grades of elemental school , giving them chance to play a freshly released videogame by that time. We formed small groups of 4 players with 2 boys and 2 girls in each group. We offered them a console and only 2 controllers. With this design, we would like to observe and analyze the differences between these players according to their age and gender. This process of learning and playing videogames lasted for 11 weeks. Result. The results have shown the capacity of learning without adult's intervention among all the players in this study. It also shows the coordination of cooperation of each group in order to learn to play the video game. We'd like to highlight their autonomy in learning and their ability to solve different conflicts happened during the process in their group, from the beginning and during the play time, their way of regulate each player's play time and also their capacity of create meanings in the game's virtual world, characters or concrete actions. Discussion. Complex and important capacities were displayed during the learnig process by the children: leadership, caring for other players, control of the process, etc. © Education and Psychology I+D+i and Ilustre Colegio Oficial de la Psicología de Andalucía Oriental (Spain).",doi,10.14204/ejrep.36.14108,Scopus,Electronic Journal of Research in Educational Psychology,"Zhao Z., Linaza J.L.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,"Resuscitative Endovascular Balloon Occlusion Of The Aorta With A Low Profile, Wire Free Device: A Game Changer?","A 24 year old male arrived to our hospital after a motor cycle crash with evidence of a traumatic brain injury and in hemorrhagic shock not responsive to volume administration. Resuscitative Endovascular Balloon Occlusion of the Aorta (REBOA) was performed in a timely fashion using a new, low profile, wire free device. This lead to rapid reversal of hypotension while his bleeding source was sought and controlled. Recently, REBOA has emerged as an adjunct in the hypotensive trauma patient with noncompressible torso hemorrhage. As first described, this procedure makes use of commonly available vascular surgery and endovascular products requiring large introducer sheaths (12–14 French) and long guidewires. Concerns regarding this technique center around the safety and feasibility of using such equipment in the emergency setting outside an angiography suite. This has likely limited widespread adoption of this technique. To address these concerns, newer products designed to be placed through a smaller sheath (7 French) and without the use of guidewires have been developed. Here we report on our first clinical use of such a device that we believe represents a significant advance in the care of the trauma patient. © 2017 The Authors",doi,10.1016/j.tcr.2017.01.006,Scopus,Trauma Case Reports,"Bogert J.N., Davis K.M., Kopelman T.R., Vail S.J., Pieri P.G., Matthews M.R.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Secretory Immunoglobulin A And Cardiovascular Responses To Acute Psychological Challenge,"Cardiovascular activity and secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) in saliva were recorded at rest, during a 30-min computer game task, and during subsequent recovery. Blood pressure (BP) rose and remained elevated during the task and returned to resting levels during recovery. This pressor response was produced by increased total peripheral resistance rather than increased cardiac output. SIgA secretion rate also increased during the task, although the effect proved significant only toward the end of the task. As such, the data provide preliminary indication that sIgA is sensitive to acute psychological challenge in the laboratory. Although correlational analyses revealed that sIgA reactions were stable, they were not significantly correlated with pressor reactions. The influence of task uncertainty was explored by comparing individuals who had previously played the computer game with those who had not. Task-induced increases in BP and sIgA were a feature of individuals new to the computer game. In contrast to these novice players, experienced players showed minimal increases in BP and no increases in sIgA.",doi,10.1207/s15327558ijbm0303_6,Scopus,International Journal of Behavioral Medicine,"Carroll D., Ring C., Shrimpton J., Evans P., Willemsen G., Hucklebridge F.",1996,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Secure Attachment Partners Attenuate Neural Responses To Social Exclusion: An Fmri Investigation,"Research has shown that social exclusion has devastating psychological, physiological, and behavioral consequences. However, little is known about possible ways to shield individuals from the detrimental effects of social exclusion. The present study, in which participants were excluded during a ball-tossing game, examined whether (reminders of) secure attachment relationships could attenuate neurophysiological pain- and stress-related responses to social exclusion. Social exclusion was associated with activation in brain areas implicated in the regulation and experience of social distress, including areas in the lateral and medial prefrontal cortex, ventral anterior cingulate cortex, and hypothalamus. However, less activation in these areas was found to the extent that participants felt more securely attached to their attachment figure. Moreover, the psychological presence (i.e., salience) of an attachment figure attenuated hypothalamus activation during episodes of social exclusion, thereby providing insight into the neural mechanisms by which attachment relationships may help in coping with social stress. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",doi,10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2011.04.003,Scopus,International Journal of Psychophysiology,"Karremans J.C., Heslenfeld D.J., van Dillen L.F., Van Lange P.A.M.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia

,Selective Cardiovascular Effects Of Stress And Cigarette Smoking In Young Women.,"In an earlier study, we found that men who smoked a cigarette and then engaged in a mildly stressful activity (video game) evidenced pronounced increases in heart rate and blood pressure, which were approximately equal to the sum of the effects produced by either smoking alone or stress alone. In the present study, a 2 (smoke vs. sham smoke) X 2 (stress vs. no stress) factorial design was used to evaluate the impact of stress and smoking on the cardiovascular responses of young women. The results revealed that the combination of stress and cigarette smoking produced blood pressure and heart rate responses that were larger than the additive effects of smoking and stress taken separately.",doi,10.1037/0278-6133.4.2.153,Scopus,"Health psychology : official journal of the Division of Health Psychology, American Psychological Association","Dembroski T.M., MacDougall J.M., Cardozo S.R., Ireland S.K., Krug-Fite J.",1985,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Self-Concept Deficits In Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games Addiction,"Background: Previous studies on Internet addiction point towards a particular constellation of personality traits and deficits in social competence of players addicted to massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs), which are hypothesized to result from impairments in self-concept. The aim of this study was to examine differences in self-concept and degree of avatar identification in World of Warcraft addicted, non-addicted and naive (nonexperienced) participants. Methods: Participants (n = 45) completed interviews and self-report questionnaires on social, emotional and physical aspects of self-concept. Attributes of participants' 'actual self', 'ideal self' and their avatar were assessed using the Giessen test. The extent of avatar identification was examined by assessing differences between 'ideal self' and avatar evaluations. Results: In contrast to nonaddicted and naive participants, addicted players showed a more negative body appraisal and lower self-esteem as well as lower permeability, social response, general mood and social potency on the Giessen test subscales. They further showed significantly lower discrepancies between 'ideal self' and avatar ratings on nearly all Giessen test subscales. Discussion: The results point towards impairments in self-concept and a higher degree in avatar identification in addicted MMORPG players compared to the remaining participants. These results could have important implications for the treatment of addicted MMORPG players. Copyright © 2013 S.

,Self-Efficacy As A Component Of Active Coping: Effects On Cardiovascular Reactivity,"Active coping remains a poorly understood construct in cardiovascular reactivity testing. We have shown that active coping comprises two independent effects: the enhanced control and the effort of exercising control. The present study tested the proposition that, with effort left unconstrained, increased self-efficacy will increase cardiovascular response. Forty women were assigned to low or high self-efficacy conditions; self-efficacy was manipulated using false feedback. Subjects then engaged in a video game shape-matching task, while blood pressure and heart rate were monitored. SBP and DBP changes were smaller in the low self-efficacy group, as predicted: 17.9 versus 25.2 mmHG for SBP (p<0.05); and 8.7 versus 13.0 mmHG for DBP (p = 0.07). Heart rate was similar for the two conditions. We conclude that self-efficacy for a task may be an integral part of the active coping process, indirectly affecting the blood pressure response by acting on the effort involved in the coping response.",doi,10.1016/0022-3999(95)00642-7,Scopus,Journal of Psychosomatic Research,"Gerin W., Litt M.D., Deich J., Pickering T.G.",1996,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Sesamoid Osteonecrosis Treated With Radial Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy,"Sesamoid osteonecrosis is a disabling condition resulting in severe forefoot pain, for which there are limited treatment options. We present a 52-year-old man with 1-year history of pain, aggravated by walking and playing tennis. On examination, pain was localised to plantar aspect of the first metatarsophalangeal joint. Imaging revealed evolving end-stage avascular necrosis of lateral sesamoid with early secondary degenerative changes. Previous exhaustive conservative treatment had been unsuccessful in alleviating his pain. As an alternative to surgery, radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy (rESWT) was proposed. Treatment protocol was 2000 pulses at frequency of 5 Hz, and pressure was varied from 1.2 to 1.8 bar according to patient tolerance. A total of eight sessions were delivered. At completion of treatment, the patient reported minimal discomfort to no pain and was able to return to playing tennis with no recurrence. We propose rESWT to be an effective novel conservative treatment for sesamoid osteonecrosis. © 2017 BMJ Publishing Group Ltd (unless otherwise stated in the text of the article).

,Sexist Attitudes Among Emerging Adult Women Readers Of Fifty Shades Fiction,"Stereotypical sexist representations of men and women in popular culture reinforce rigid views of masculinity (e.g., males as being strong, in control, masterful, and aggressive) and femininity (e.g., women as being fragile and weak, unassertive, peaceful, irrational, and driven by emotions). The present study examined associations between the fictional series Fifty Shades—one popular culture mechanism that includes pervasive traditional gender role representations—and underlying sexist beliefs among a sample of 715 women ages 18–24 years. Analyses revealed associations between Fifty Shades readership and sexism, as measured through the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory. Namely women who reported reading Fifty Shades had higher levels of ambivalent, benevolent, and hostile sexism. Further, those who interpreted Fifty Shades as “romantic” had higher levels of ambivalent and benevolent sexism. Our findings support prior empirical studies noting associations between interacting with aspects of popular culture, such as television and video games, and individual beliefs and behaviors. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",doi,10.1007/s10508-016-0724-4,Scopus,Archives of Sexual Behavior,"Altenburger L.E., Carotta C.L., Bonomi A.E., Snyder A.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Short-Term And Long-Term Effects Of Violent Media On Aggression In Children And Adults,"Objectives: To test whether the results of the accumulated studies on media violence and aggressive behavior are consistent with the theories that have evolved to explain the effects. We tested for the existence of both short-term and long-term effects for aggressive behavior. We also tested the theory-driven hypothesis that short-term effects should be greater for adults and long-term effects should be greater for children. Design: Meta-analysis. Participants: Children younger than 18 years and adults. Main Exposures: Violent media, including TV, movies, video games, music, and comic books. Main Outcome Measures: Measures of aggressive behavior, aggressive thoughts, angry feelings, physiological arousal (eg, heart rate, blood pressure), and helping behavior. Results: Effect size estimates were combined using meta-analytic procedures. As expected, the short-term effects of violent media were greater for adults than for children whereas the long-term effects were greater for children than for adults. The results also showed that there were overall modest but significant effect sizes for exposure to media violence on aggressive behaviors, aggressive thoughts, angry feelings, arousal levels, and helping behavior. Conclusions: The results are consistent with the theory that short-term effects are mostly due to the priming of existing well-encoded scripts, schemas, or beliefs, which adults have had more time to encode. In contrast, long-term effects require the learning (encoding) of scripts, schemas, or beliefs. Children can encode new scripts, schemas, and beliefs via observational learning with less interference and effort than adults. ©2006 American Medical Association.

,Simulating Terrorism And Insurgency: Video Games In The War Of Ideas,"This article analyses several video games created by Hezbollah and Afkar Media which simulate recent conflicts in Israel and Lebanon. These games are representative of an important new means of waging ideological warfare which is increasingly a part of the media strategies that states, violent non-state actors and media corporations employ in their efforts to persuade audiences. I argue that video games allow their developers to address players as though they were participants in ongoing conflicts, rather than passive observers, and that this style of presentation is extremely useful to efforts to create an attractive image of people who are frequently described as ‘terrorists’. Video games also enable their developers to carefully construct media narratives that appear to be realistic depictions of contemporary conflicts even when those narratives show signs of bias. Through these mechanisms, video games provide violent non-state actors and organizations sympathetic to them with a means of presenting their grievances and displaying their fighting prowess in ways that advance the organizations' strategic goals. © 2014, Centre of International Studies.",doi,10.1080/09557571.2014.960508,Scopus,Cambridge Review of International Affairs,Schulzke M.,2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Simulation And Computational Intelligence In Real-World Applications,"Many real-world applications of computational intelligence (CI) start with a good training simulator. Enhancing the simulator to use many human senses and to facilitate collection and analysis of data may produce an intelligent virtual reality (VR) system. Careful design of a VR system may encourage the use of “hooks” to allow collection of data, conversion to meaningful informatian, and incorporation of intelligence into later versions and into the final, real-world product. This paper will illustrate these concepts by discussing the challenges of autonomous flight, from simulation to implementation. Fuzzy risk analysis is suggested as a performance evaluation tool for design of CI systems, here defined as systems incorporating artificial neural networks (NN), fuzzy systems, (FZ) evolutionary systems (EC) and/or virtual reality (VR). Intelligent virtual simulation is a tool of the future which promises to move from an intriguing pastime for gamers to a rigorously applied scientific discipline offering economic advantages and service to those working in applications ranging from training simulators to accessibility aids for the handicapped.

,Simulation Of The Dynamics Of Nonplayer Characters' Emotions And Social Relations In Games,"One of the main challenges faced by the video game industry is to give life to believable nonplayer characters (NPCs). Research shows that emotions play a key role in determining the behavior of individuals. In order to improve the believability of NPCs' behavior, we propose in this paper a model of the dynamics of emotions taking into account the personality and the social relations of the character. First, we present work from the literature on emotions, personality, and social relations in computer science and in human and social sciences.We focus on the influence of personality on the triggering of emotions, and the influence of emotions on the dynamics of social relations. Based on this work, we propose a dynamic model of the socioemotional state and its implementation as part of a tool for game programmers. This tool aims at the simulation of the evolution of emotions and social relations of NPCs based on their personality and roles.",doi,10.1109/TCIAIG.2009.2036247,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games,"Ochs M., Sabouret N., Corruble V.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Sleep Quality Is Negatively Related To Video Gaming Volume In Adults,"Most literature on the relationship between video gaming and sleep disturbances has looked at children and adolescents. There is little research on such a relationship in adult samples. The aim of the current study was to investigate the association of video game volume with sleep quality in adults via face-to-face interviews using standardized questionnaires. Adults (n = 844, 56.2% women), aged 18-94 years old, participated in the study. Sleep quality was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and gaming volume was assessed by asking the hours of gaming on a regular weekday (Mon-Thurs), Friday and weekend day (Sat-Sun). Adjusting for gender, age, educational level, exercise and perceived stress, results of hierarchical regression analyses indicated that video gaming volume was a significant predictor of sleep quality (β = 0.145), fatigue (β = 0.109), insomnia (β = 0.120), bedtime (β = 0.100) and rise time (β = 0.168). Each additional hour of video gaming per day delayed bedtime by 6.9 min (95% confidence interval 2.0-11.9 min) and rise time by 13.8 min (95% confidence interval 7.8-19.7 min). Attributable risk for having poor sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index > 5) due to gaming >1 h day was 30%. When examining the components of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index using multinomial regression analysis (odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals), gaming volume significantly predicted sleep latency, sleep efficiency and use of sleep medication. In general, findings support the conclusion that gaming volume is negatively related to the overall sleep quality of adults, which might be due to underlying mechanisms of screen exposure and arousal. © 2014 European Sleep Research Society.",doi,10.1111/jsr.12255,Scopus,Journal of Sleep Research,"Exelmans L., Van den Bulck J.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia

,Social Competence Interview For Assessing Physiological Reactivity In Adolescents,"Difficulties in predicting 'real life' physiological variation from responses to controlled stress tasks suggest the need for more ecologically valid laboratory challenges. The Social Competence Interview (SCI) measures physiological changes elicited by re-experiencing a life situation in which a valued striving was unexpectedly hindered. The 14-minute interview yields data on subjects' goals, skills, problem-solving strategies, and social resources. We compared the SCI to video game (VG), mirror drawing (MD), and mental arithmetic (MA) in a racially balanced sample of 260 adolescents (age 14 to 15 years). Blood pressure changes during SCI exceeded those during the other tasks, and were unaffected by race or gender. Blood pressure responses to SCI correlated with responses to MA and MD but appeared to capture a unique domain of social reactivity. Test-retest correlations over 6 months in a random subsample of 27 subjects showed that blood pressure reactivity to SCI and other tasks was reproducible. Intrasubject analyses of responses to the different tasks disclosed subgroups of consistently high and consistently low responders who may be at higher or lower risk. The SCI is not threatening and was rated by subjects as less frustrating or demanding than MD or MA. Its demonstrated effectiveness when administered by several different interviewers suggests the SCI is a promising technique for large scale studies of younger populations.",doi,10.1097/00006842-199105000-00003,Scopus,Psychosomatic Medicine,"Ewart C.K., Kolodner K.B.",1991,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Social Equality In The Number Of Choice Options Is Represented In The Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex,"A distinct aspect of the sense of fairness in humans is that we care not only about equality in material rewards but also about equality in nonmaterial values. One such value is the opportunity to choose freely among many options, often regarded as a fundamental right to economic freedom. In modern developed societies, equal opportunities in work, living, and lifestyle are enforced by antidiscrimination laws. Despite the widespread endorsement of equal opportunity, no studies have explored how people assign value to it. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify the neural substrates for subjective valuation of equality in choice opportunity. Participants performed a two-person choice task in which the number of choices available was varied across trials independently of choice outcomes. By using this procedure, we manipulated the degree of equality in choice opportunity between players and dissociated it from the value of reward outcomes and their equality. We found that activation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) tracked the degree to which the number of options between the two players was equal. In contrast, activation in the ventral striatum tracked the number of options available to participants themselves but not the equality between players. Our results demonstrate that the vmPFC, a key brain region previously implicated in the processing of social values, is also involved in valuation of equality in choice opportunity between individuals. These findings may provide valuable insight into the human ability to value equal opportunity, a characteristic long emphasized in politics, economics, and philosophy. © 2014 the authors.",doi,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4427-13.2014,Scopus,Journal of Neuroscience,"Aoki R., Matsumoto M., Yomogida Y., Izuma K., Murayama K., Sugiura A., Camerer C.F., Adolphs R., Matsumoto K.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,"Social Exclusion In Middle Childhood: Rejection Events, Slow-Wave Neural Activity, And Ostracism Distress","This study examined neural activity with event-related potentials (ERPs) in middle childhood during a computer-simulated ball-toss game, Cyberball. After experiencing fair play initially, children were ultimately excluded by the other players. We focused specifically on ""not my turn"" events within fair play and rejection events within social exclusion. Dense-array ERPs revealed that rejection events are perceived rapidly. Condition differences (""not my turn"" vs. rejection) were evident in a posterior ERP peaking at 420 ms consistent, with a larger P3 effect for rejection events indicating that in middle childhood rejection events are differentiated in <500 ms. Condition differences were evident for slow-wave activity (500-900 ms) in the medial frontal cortical region and the posterior occipital-parietal region, with rejection events more negative frontally and more positive posteriorly. Distress from the rejection experience was associated with a more negative frontal slow wave and a larger late positive slow wave, but only for rejection events. Source modeling with Geosouce software suggested that slow-wave neural activity in cortical regions previously identified in functional imaging studies of ostracism, including sub-genual cortex, ventral anterior cingulate cortex, and insula, was greater for rejection events vs. ""not my turn"" events. © 2010 Psychology Press.",doi,10.1080/17470919.2010.500169,Scopus,Social Neuroscience,"Crowley M.J., Wu J., Molfese P.J., Mayes L.C.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Social Network Modulation Of Reward-Related Signals,"Everyday goals and experiences are often shared with others who may hold different places within our social networks. We investigated whether the experience of sharing a reward differs with respect to social network. Twenty human participants played a card guessing game for shared monetary outcomes with three partners: a computer, a confederate (out of network), and a friend (in network). Participants subjectively rated the experience of sharing a reward more positively with their friends than the other partners. Neuroimaging results support participants' subjective reports, as ventral striatal BOLD responses were more robust when sharing monetary gains with a friend as compared to the confederate or computer, suggesting a higher value for sharing with an in-network partner. Interestingly, ratings of social closeness covaried with this activity, resulting in a significant partner × closeness interaction; exploratory analysis showed that only participants reporting higher levels of closeness demonstrated partner-related differences in striatal BOLD response. These results suggest that reward valuation in social contexts is sensitive to distinctions of social network, such that sharing positive experiences with in-network others may carry higher value. © 2012 the authors.",doi,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0610-12.2012,Scopus,Journal of Neuroscience,"Fareri D.S., Niznikiewicz M.A., Lee V.K., Delgado M.R.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Social Network Sites Influence Recovery From Social Exclusion: Individual Differences In Social Anxiety,"Social network sites (SNSs) have been found to be closely associated with responses to social exclusion and to impact people with high or low levels of social anxiety in different ways. Our study tested whether social anxiety, an individual difference variable, affected the association between SNSs and responses to social exclusion. A Cyberball game was conducted to create social exclusion, followed by a waiting period during which participants were observed to see whether they would choose to use SNSs. Afterwards, recovery from participants' negative responses to exclusion was measured. Results showed that using SNSs benefited the highly socially anxious (HSA) group in terms of recovering from disconnection and feeling a sense of meaningful existence more than the low socially anxious (LSA) group. However, recovery from disconnection was lower for LSA individuals who used SNSs than those who did not use SNSs. Our research suggests that SNSs benefited HSA individuals after social exclusion, but hindered the recovery of LSA individuals. © 2017",doi,10.1016/j.chb.2017.05.044,Scopus,Computers in Human Behavior,"Lin X., Li S., Qu C.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Speaking To The Dead: Images Of The Dead In Contemporary Art,"In this article I explore works by three artists in which we can see images that relate to bereavement. In the work of the first two, Araya Rasdjarmrearnsook and Andres Serrano, we can see photographic images (still and moving) of human corpses, which have been criticized as morbid and unhealthy. However I argue that it is not in fact images of death or the dead that are problematic but those images which present or evoke evidence of the emotions associated with death, and create a situation where we imagine the circumstances of our own deaths or the death of those we love. Images of the dead are acceptable as long as they do not cause pain to the living, as in a video game fantasy or a fiction, or are seen as other and distant. In the second group of works, by Gustgav Metzger, The Absent Dead: The Surrogate Body, the body is not present either because the death has taken place at a distance, either in time or geographically, or both, and a new site must be created. In this section, I discuss Metzger's auto-destructive art and argue that these works, through their ephemerality, embody a form of 'meaning making' and a possibility of the benefits of grief as described by Parkes. © The Author(s) 2011.",doi,10.1177/1363459310397978,Scopus,Health,O'Neill M.,2011,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,"State, Not Trait, Neuroendocrine Function Predicts Costly Reactive Aggression In Men After Social Exclusion And Inclusion","Social exclusion increases aggressive behaviour, and the possible neuroendocrine underpinnings of the effect are largely unknown. Here, we examined the extent to which testosterone and cortisol responses to social exclusion would predict subsequent reactive aggression. Men were randomly assigned to a social exclusion (SE) or inclusion (SI) condition of 'Cyberball', a computer ball-toss game. Aggression was then measured using the Point Subtraction Aggression Paradigm (PSAP). Saliva was collected at three points for the measurement of testosterone and cortisol. Regression analyses indicated that testosterone concentrations 10-min into the PSAP (controlling for pre- and post-Cyberball testosterone) were positively correlated with aggressive behaviour, irrespective of SI/SE. Post hoc analyses for the conditions separately, however, suggested the relationship was stronger for SI men (R2 change=13.3%, F1, 29=5.28, p=0.03) than for SE men (R2 change=1.8%, F1, 26=0.49, p=0.49). Aggressive behaviour was also positively correlated with cortisol concentrations 10-min into the PSAP (controlling for pre- and post-Cyberball cortisol) irrespective of SE/SI. When both hormones were included in the regression model, the interaction of baseline 'Cortisol'×'Testosterone'×'Experimental Group' approached significance (R2 change=5.4%, F1, 55=3.53, p=0.07), but no significant effects were observed in either group alone. The findings add to evidence that individual differences in state neuroendocrine function map onto variability in human social behaviour. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",doi,10.1016/j.biopsycho.2011.02.020,Scopus,Biological Psychology,"Geniole S.N., Carré J.M., McCormick C.M.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Striatal Connectivity Changes Following Gambling Wins And Near-Misses: Associations With Gambling Severity,"Frontostriatal circuitry is implicated in the cognitive distortions associated with gambling behaviour. 'Near-miss' events, where unsuccessful outcomes are proximal to a jackpot win, recruit overlapping neural circuitry with actual monetary wins. Personal control over a gamble (e.g., via choice) is also known to increase confidence in one's chances of winning (the 'illusion of control'). Using psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses, we examined changes in functional connectivity as regular gamblers and non-gambling participants played a slot-machine game that delivered wins, near-misses and full-misses, and manipulated personal control. We focussed on connectivity with striatal seed regions, and associations with gambling severity, using voxel-wise regression. For the interaction term of near-misses (versus full-misses) by personal choice (participant-chosen versus computer-chosen), ventral striatal connectivity with the insula, bilaterally, was positively correlated with gambling severity. In addition, some effects for the contrast of wins compared to all non-wins were observed at an uncorrected (p <.001) threshold: there was an overall increase in connectivity between the striatal seeds and left orbitofrontal cortex and posterior insula, and a negative correlation for gambling severity with the connectivity between the right ventral striatal seed and left anterior cingulate cortex. These findings corroborate the 'non-categorical' nature of reward processing in gambling: near-misses and full-misses are objectively identical outcomes that are processed differentially. Ventral striatal connectivity with the insula correlated positively with gambling severity in the illusion of control contrast, which could be a risk factor for the cognitive distortions and loss-chasing that are characteristic of problem gambling. © 2014 The Authors.

,Sympathetically Mediated Effects Of Mental Stress On The Cardiac Microcirculation Of Patients With Coronary Artery Disease,"Mental stress often causes myocardial ischemia in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). There is increasing evidence mat the coronary microcirculation of patients with atherosclerosis may be dysfunctional, with the potential of contributing to myocardial ischemia. This study investigated sympathetically mediated coronary microcirculatory and regional noradrenergic effects of mental stress. We measured left anterior descending coronary artery blood flow and norepinephrine kinetics at rest and during a 10-minute video game in 10 CAD patients with nonsignificant atherosclerosis of this artery and in 5 patients with normal coronary angiograms (NCA). The 2 groups did not differ in their responses of systemic and cardiac norepinephrine spillovers, heart rate, and blood pressure during mental stress. Patients with NCA had microvascular dilation during mental stress (26 ± 9% [mean ± SD] decline in coronary vascular resistance from baseline, p < 0.01), whereas patients with CAD did not (9 ± 20% decline, p = 0.11). Six patients with CAD then received intracoronary hentolamine (1.7 ng/kg/min for 5 minutes, followed by 0.17 μg/kg/min) and played the video game again. In contrast to nonsignificant changes in coronary resistance during the initial video game (6 ± 15% decline, p = 0.20), coronary vascular resistance decreased significantly during the repeat video game (25 ± 19% decline, p = 0.02). Vasomotor responses of epicardial coronary artery segments did not differ between the 2 video game studies. Five other patients (4 with CAD, 1 with NCA) repeated the video game during intracoronary administration of 5% dextrose, with systemic and coronary hemodynamic and noradrenergic responses unchanged from those during the initial video game. Thus, the coronary microcirculation of patients with CAD fails to dilate during mental stress, a response likely mediated by α-adrenoceptor activation mat may contribute to myocardial ischemia. © 1995 Excerpta Medica, Inc.

,"Task Decomposition, Dynamic Role Assignment, And Low-Bandwidth Communication For Real-Time Strategic Teamwork","Multi-agent domains consisting of teams of agents that need to collaborate in an adversarial environment offer challenging research opportunities. In this article, we introduce periodic team synchronization (PTS) domains as time-critical environments in which agents act autonomously with low communication, but in which they can periodically synchronize in a full-communication setting. The two main contributions of this article are a flexible team agent structure and a method for inter-agent communication. First, the team agent structure allows agents to capture and reason about team agreements. We achieve collaboration between agents through the introduction of formations. A formation decomposes the task space defining a set of roles. Homogeneous agents can flexibly switch roles within formations, and agents can change formations dynamically, according to predefined triggers to be evaluated at run-time. This flexibility increases the performance of the overall team. Our teamwork structure further includes pre-planning for frequently occurring situations. Second, the communication method is designed for use during the low-communication periods in PTS domains. It overcomes the obstacles to inter-agent communication in multi-agent environments with unreliable, single-channel, high-cost, low-bandwidth communication. We fully implemented both the flexible teamwork structure and the communication method in the domain of simulated robotic soccer, and conducted controlled empirical experiments to verify their effectiveness. In addition, our simulator team made it to the semi-finals of the RoboCup-97 competition, in which 29 teams participated.

,Task Versus Vehicle-Based Control Paradigms In Multiple Unmanned Vehicle Supervision By A Single Operator,"There has recently been a significant amount of activity in developing supervisory control algorithms for multiple unmanned aerial vehicle operation by a single operator. While previous work has demonstrated the favorable impacts that arise in the introduction of increasingly sophisticated autonomy algorithms, little work has performed an explicit comparison of different types of multiple unmanned vehicle control architectures on operator performance and workload. This paper compares a vehicle-based paradigm (where a single operator individually assigns tasks to unmanned assets) to a task-based paradigm (where the operator generates a task list, which is then given to the group of vehicles that determine how to best divide the tasks among themselves.) The results demonstrate significant advantages in using a task-based paradigm for both overall performance and robustness to increased workload. This effort also demonstrated that while previous video gaming experience mattered for performance, the degree of experience that demonstrated benefit was minimal. Further work should focus on designing a flexible automated system that allows operators to focus on a primary goal, but also facilitate lower level control when needed without degradation in performance. © 2013 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/THMS.2014.2304962,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems,"Cummings M.L., Bertucelli L.F., Macbeth J., Surana A.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Teaming Up Humans With Autonomous Synthetic Characters,"Autonomous synthetic characters have the potential to promote the social engagement of users in virtual environments, enhancing their interaction experience. In computer games, for example, poor interaction with game characters can drastically detract from the gaming experience, making the design of autonomous synthetic characters an important issue. In particular, in Role Playing Games (RPGs), for example, users and autonomous characters often perform in a group. Usually, the role of such characters is very limited since they lack the social skills to perform coherently in group scenarios. The goal of the work presented here is to endow autonomous synthetic characters with social skills that allow them to perform in groups with human members. However, to successfully achieve this, it is not enough to assure that the characters behave in a coherent manner from an individual perspective or that they are able to perform the group task optimally. It is also necessary that the autonomous characters exhibit behaviours that are coherent with the group's composition, context and structure. For this reason, we have developed a model to support group dynamics of autonomous synthetic characters (SGD model) inspired by theories developed in human social psychological sciences. This model defines the knowledge that each individual should build about the others and the group, and how this knowledge drives their interactions. The model was used in a collaborative computer game that was tested with users. The results showed that the model had a positive effect on the users' social engagement, namely, on their trust and identification with the group. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

,Tell Me A Story,"For the past few years, the storytelling research domain has raised the interest of several researchers from different areas (such as interactive drama, computer games, intelligent learning environment etc.), mainly because stories are an important vehicle to structure the human knowledge and past experience, and even to help people to behave in a social context. In this paper, we present a storytelling approach, which is based on the premise that story and narrative may emerge from characters' interactions during the creation activity, but such characters may either act autonomously or be controlled by children. Since we position our research in an educational context, we argue that in such creation activities children's thoughts and needs must be respected and contribute directly to the achievement of the story. Therefore, children should be provided with some support and guidance directives to help them to better understand and reflect on the role-taking situations they experience during such activity. To prove the validity of our approach we developed a generic architecture - Support And Guidance Architecture (SAGA). SAGA aims not only to provide support and guidance to children during the story telling activities, by combining the roles of a dynamic script writer and a drama manager, but also to provide such services to already existing story creation applications. To illustrate this, we have integrated SAGA with Teatrix, a collaborative virtual environment for story creation, and an evaluation study was conducted in order to find the impact of SAGA in children's storytelling activities. © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2005.",doi,10.1007/s10055-005-0002-6,Scopus,Virtual Reality,"Machado I., Brna P., Paiva A.",2005,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,The 'Narrative Turn' In Developing Foresight: Assessing How Cultural Products Can Assist Organisations In Detecting Trends,"When developing foresight, it is essential to consider the information on which this activity is based. Weak signals, also conceptualised as trends, can be considered the most relevant input for developing foresight in an organisation. While detecting weak signals has traditionally relied on the news media, cultural products such as literature, movies, art, or computer games appear to have been neglected in the practice of foresight.However, literary genres such as novels can be a valuable source for developing foresight. Literature can be characterised as delivering ""thick descriptions"". Not only do novels describe social practices, but from them the reader also gains, for instance, deep insights into the feelings and emotions of the characters.These thick descriptions are even more interesting in the context of foresight when one considers that these descriptions play a role in the construction of social reality and therefore can influence, over time, reality, or rather translate fiction into fact. It can be argued that the new departs from cultural products, before translating into widely accepted social practices or mass-market products. The value of using literature in foresight also appears to be related to the notion that these narratives can be read as scenarios, revealing the potential of literature. Because of their narrative structure, these scenarios can overcome cognitive barriers in the development of foresight. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",doi,10.1016/j.techfore.2014.02.024,Scopus,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,Schwarz J.O.,2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,The Association Between Exercise Behavior Regulation And Exergaming In Adolescents,"Background: It is not known if or how exercise behavior regulations (EBRs) relate to exergaming in adolescents. The study objectives were 1) to determine if EBRs differ between adolescents who do and do not exergame; and 2) among exergamers, to describe the associations between EBRs and exergame duration, intensity, and achieving physical activity (PA) guidelines. Methods: This study was a cross-sectional analysis of data collected in mailed self-report questionnaires completed by 1243 students (mean ± SD<inf>age</inf> = 16.8 ± 0.5 years; 43% boys). Results: In girls, those who exergamed scored higher than nonexergamers on introjected (mean ± SD = 1.9 ± 1.0 vs.1.6 ± 0.9; P = .001) and identified (mean ± SD = 3.1 ± .0 vs.2.9 ± 0.9; P = .049) regulation. Exergame intensity was associated with identified regulation [OR (95% CI) = 2.2 (1.0, 4.5)], minutes exergaming per week was associated with amotivation [β (95% CI) = 0.4 (-0.0, 0.8)], and achieving guidelines was associated with external [OR (95% CI) = 3.7 (1.0, 13.4)] and identified [OR (95% CI) = 5.6 (2.0, 16.0)] regulations. In boys who exergamed, intrinsic regulation was associated with exergame duration [β (95% CI) = -0.3 (-0.6, 0.0)]. Conclusions: Girls who exergame may have partially internalized exergaming as a PA behavior. Boys may prefer other types of PA such as team sports or other more traditional videogames over exergaming or they may not view exergaming as PA. © 2015 Human Kinetics, Inc.",doi,10.1123/jpah.2012-0455,Scopus,Journal of Physical Activity and Health,"O'Loughlin E.K., Sabiston C.M., Dugas E.N., O'Loughlin J.L.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,The Beat Goes On,"A 45-year-old man presented to the emergency room after a syncopal episode that occurred while he was watching a baseball game. The syncopal event was preceded by the sudden onset of lightheadedness. He awoke after several seconds, without confusion. He noted nausea and diaphoresis but reported no chest pain before or after the event. An emergency-medical-services team obtained an electrocardiogram that revealed monomorphic, wide-complex tachycardia at a rate of 240 beats per minute; the blood pressure was 110/50 mm Hg. The team administered amiodarone, without effect, and brought the patient to the hospital; on arrival, his systolic pressure was 70 mm Hg. Electrocardioversion was performed, with successful restoration of sinus rhythm. Pertinent electrocardiographic findings noted before cardioversion included QS complexes across the precordium (negative precordial concordance) and right-axis deviation. Analysis of these findings and the postcardioversion tracing supported the diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia.

,The Benefits Of Playing Video Games,"Video games are a ubiquitous part of almost all children's and adolescents' lives, with 97% playing for at least one hour per day in the United States. The vast majority of research by psychologists on the effects of ""gaming"" has been on its negative impact: the potential harm related to violence, addiction, and depression. We recognize the value of that research; however, we argue that a more balanced perspective is needed, one that considers not only the possible negative effects but also the benefits of playing these games. Considering these potential benefits is important, in part, because the nature of these games has changed dramatically in the last decade, becoming increasingly complex, diverse, realistic, and social in nature. A small but significant body of research has begun to emerge, mostly in the last five years, documenting these benefits. In this article, we summarize the research on the positive effects of playing video games, focusing on four main domains: cognitive, motivational, emotional, and social. By integrating insights from developmental, positive, and social psychology, as well as media psychology, we propose some candidate mechanisms by which playing video games may foster real-world psychosocial benefits. Our aim is to provide strong enough evidence and a theoretical rationale to inspire new programs of research on the largely unexplored mental health benefits of gaming. Finally, we end with a call to intervention researchers and practitioners to test the positive uses of video games, and we suggest several promising directions for doing so. © 2013 American Psychological Association.",doi,10.1037/a0034857,Scopus,American Psychologist,"Granic I., Lobel A., Engels R.C.M.E.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,The Effect Of A Β-Adrenoceptor Antagonist On Accommodative Adaptation In Hong Kong Children,"Purpose: Increased susceptibility to nearwork-induced accommodative adaptation has been suggested as a risk factor for myopia development. We investigated whether accommodative adaptation may explain in part the high prevalence of myopia in Hong Kong children and examined the effect of β-antagonism with topical timolol maleate on accommodative adaptation. Methods: Thirty children (10 emmetropes and 20 myopes) aged between 8 and 12 years were recruited. Tonic accommodation was measured before and after 5 min of video game-playing using an open-field Shin-Nippon auto refractor. Measurements were repeated 30 min after timolol instillation. Results: Children with progressing myopia demonstrated accommodative adaptation following the near task, whereas stable myopes showed counter-adaptive, hyperopic accommodative changes. Timolol increased the magnitude of accommodative adaptation in the stable myopes but had little effect on responses of the progressing myopes or emmetropes. Conclusions: Neuropharmacological modulation of the accommodative system may have a possible etiological role in the progression of myopia.",doi,10.1080/02713680490908571,Scopus,Current Eye Research,"Chen J.C., Schmid K.L., Brown B., Edwards M.H.",2005,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,The Effect Of Laboratory Stressors On Glycemic Control And Gastrointestinal Transit Time,"This study compared effects of an active coping task (computerized stressors involving arithmetic, anagrams, and Atari games) and a passive coping task (cold pressor) on gastrointestinal transit time and glycemic response to an oral glucose load. Eleven normal weight males were studied; subjects participated in three counterbalanced sessions, each including a 45-minute baseline, 20-minute experimental period (active coping, passive coping, or nonstress control) and 2.5-hour recovery period. The stressors produced different cardiovascular and catecholamine responses; systolic and diastolic blood pressure were highest during cold pressor (p < 0.001), heart rate was highest during computer stressor (p < 0.001), and norepinephrine excretion was greatest during cold pressor (p < 0.002). However, both stressors delayed gastrointestinal transit time compared with the control condition (p < 0.009 and p < 0.026 for cold pressor and computerized stressor, respectively) and both delayed the time of peak glucose response (p < 0.002 and p < 0.05, respectively).

,The Effect Of Video Game Violence On Physiological Desensitization To Real-Life Violence,"Past research shows that violent video game exposure increases aggressive thoughts, angry feelings, physiological arousal, aggressive behaviors, and decreases helpful behaviors. However, no research has experimentally examined violent video game effects on physiological desensitization, defined as showing less physiological arousal to violence in the real world after exposure to video game violence in the virtual world. This experiment attempts to fill this gap. Participants reported their media habits and then played one of eight violent or nonviolent video games for 20 min. Next, participants watched a 10-min videotape containing scenes of real-life violence while heart rate (HR) and galvanic skin response (GSR) were monitored. Participants who previously played a violent video game had lower HR and GSR while viewing filmed real violence, demonstrating a physiological desensitization to violence. Results are interpreted using an expanded version of the General Aggression Model. Links between desensitization, antisocial, and prosocial behavior are discussed. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

,The Effects Of Acute Doses Of Nicotine On Video Lottery Terminal Gambling In Daily Smokers,"Rationale A growing body of evidence suggests that gambling frequently co-occurs with smoking, yet little is known about the degree to which nicotine and/or tobacco use influences gambling behavior. Nonetheless, an increasing number of studies suggest that acute administration of nicotine may alter other reinforcing behaviors in both animal and human models, raising the possibility that nicotine may also influence gambling behavior and craving. Objectives The purpose of this study was to examine the acute effects of nicotine on subjective and behavioral gambling responses. Methods Twenty-eight (15 male) regular gamblers who smoke daily completed two double-blind laboratory sessions where their subjective and behavioral responses to video lottery terminal (VLT) gambling were assessed, following the administration of nicotine inhalers (NI; 4 mg deliverable) or placebo inhalers. Results NI significantly decreased tobacco-related cravings (p<0.05) but did not affect gambling-related cravings, VLT betting patterns, or subjective responses (ps>0.1). Conclusions NI were found to acutely suppress tobacco-related cravings without influencing gambling. These results suggest that use of nicotine replacement therapies may be a safe option for gamblers who are attempting to quit smoking. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",doi,10.1007/s00213-011-2465-3,Scopus,Psychopharmacology,"McGrath D.S., Barrett S.P., Stewart S.H., Schmid E.A.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,The Effects Of Game-Based Breathing Exercise On Pulmonary Function In Stroke Patients: A Preliminary Study,"Background: Reduction of respiratory function along with hemiparesis leads to decreased endurance, dyspnea, and increased sedentary behavior, as well as to an increased risk of stroke. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the preliminary effects of game-based breathing exercise (GBE) on pulmonary function in stroke patients. Material/Methods: Thirty-eight in-patients with stroke (22 men, 16 women) were recruited for the study. Participants were randomly allocated into 2 groups: patients assigned to the GBE group (n=19), and the control group (n=19). The GBE group participated in a GBE program for 25 minutes a day, 3 days a week, during a 5 week period. For the same period, both groups participated in a conventional stroke rehabilitation program. Forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV1), FEV1/FVC, and maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV) were measured by a spirometer in pre- and post-testing. Results: The GBE group had significantly improved FVC, FEV1, and MVV values compared with the control group (p&lt;0.05), although there was no significant difference in FEV1/FVC value between groups. Significant short-term effects of the GBE program on pulmonary function in stroke patients were recorded in this study. Conclusions: These findings gave some indications that it may be feasible to include GBE in rehabilitation interventions with this population. © Med Sci Monit, 2015.",doi,10.12659/MSM.893420,Scopus,Medical Science Monitor,"Joo S., Shin D., Song C.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,The Effects Of Prosocial And Aggressive Video Games On Children’s Donating And Helping.,"We investigated the effects of a prosocial and an aggressive videogame on children's prosocial behavior. Third-, fourth-, seventh-, and eighth-grade boys and girls (N = 160) were randomly assigned to either a control condition or one of four treatment conditions. In two of the treatment conditions, children played a videogame with prosocial content either singly or cooperatively with another child. In the other two conditions, children played an aggressive videogame either singly or competitively. Subsequent levels of donating and helping were measured. A three-way analysis of variance indicated that older students donated significantly more than did younger students. Children who played either of the aggressive videogames donated significantly less than did those who played prosocial games by themselves. No significant effects were found for helping. Playing the prosocial videogame did not increase prosocial responding, but playing the aggressive videogame tended to suppress this behavior. The failure of the prosocial game to accelerate prosocial responding might be due to the relatively brief treatments used in this study and/or to the particular prosocial videogame utilized.",doi,10.1080/00221325.1987.10532488,anderson2010,Journal of Genetic Psychology,"Chambers, J.

,The Effects Of Sympathetic Nervous System Activation And Psychological Stress On Glucose Metabolism And Blood Pressure In Subjects With Type 2 (Non-Insulin-Dependent) Diabetes Mellitus,"The sympathetic nervous system may contribute to excessive hepatic glucose output in Type 2 (non-insulin dependent) diabetes mellitus and could be implicated in the interrelated problem of hypertension. The aim of these studies was to determine whether subjects with Type 2 diabetes had normal sensitivity (compared with age- and weight-matched non-diabetic subjects) to noradrenaline infusion (60 ng · kg-1 · min-1 for 60 min) and to compare the responses with oral tyramine administration (800 mg), and psychological stress (using competitive computer games). Noradrenaline infusion caused significantly greater plasma glucose (mean increment 2.1±0.4 vs 0.6±0.1 mmol/l, p&lt;0.005) and pressor responses (mean systolic increment 21±3 vs 11±1mm Hg, p&lt;0.02) in the diabetic subjects. The excessive glycaemia was due to increased hepatic glucose output rather than reduced glucose disposal. Tyramine administration caused significantly increased hepatic glucose output and plasma glucose levels, but with similar responses in the diabetic and non-diabetic subjects; the pulse and pressor responses were also similar between the groups. The psychological stressor induced significant increases in pulse, blood pressure and non-esterified fatty acid levels in the combined group of subjects (p&lt;0.01) but did not influence plasma glucose levels in either diabetic or non-diabetic subjects. We conclude that pharmacologically-induced sympathetic nervous stimulation can induce hyperglycaemia. Subjects with uncomplicated Type 2 diabetes have increased sensitivity to exogenous noradrenaline but may not hyperrespond to endogenous sympathetic activation. © 1992 Springer-Verlag.",doi,10.1007/BF00399929,Scopus,Diabetologia,"Bruce D.G., Chisholm D.J., Storlien L.H., Kraegen E.W., Smythe G.A.",1992,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia

,The G Protein-Coupled Receptor Kinase 4 Gene Modulates Stress-Induced Sodium Excretion In Black Normotensive Adolescents,"Approximately 20-40% of adolescents have shown a reduction of urinary sodium excretion (UNaV) in response to blood pressure (BP) increase during behavioral stress. G protein-coupled receptor kinase 4 (GRK4) mediates the pressure and natriuresis relation. The present study investigated the impact of GRK4 genetic variants on UNaV under stress. A total of 664 normotensive adolescents including whites and blacks (17.6 ± 3.3 yrs, 43.4% blacks) were recruited. Participants were subjected to a stress-protocol including three 10-min tasks (a social competence interview, a virtual reality car driving simulation test, and a video game challenge), concluded by a urine collection. Three functional polymorphisms including R65L, A142V and A486V were genotyped. Given blacks compared with whites had significantly higher systolic BP (SBP) levels during rest (p < 0.001) and stress (p ≤ 0.001), there was no statistical difference in UNaV in response to stress between the two ethnic groups. In blacks, compared with R65R homozygotes, individuals with R65L or L65L genotype had significantly lower levels of stress-induced UNaV (8.42 ± 0.63 versus 9.85 ± 0.37 mEq/h, p = 0.01). In summary, BP elevation seems uncoupled with UNaV increase during behavioral stress in black adolescents. The 65L allele of the GRK4 gene is associated with stress-induced UNaV reduction, suggesting impaired sodium handling in affected black youth.

,The Impact Of A School-Based Active Video Game Play Intervention On Children's Physical Activity During Recess,"Purpose. To assess physical activity levels during active video game play over time and compare this to 'free play' associated with recess activity in a sample of British primary school children over a 6-week period. Basic procedures. Thirty children (ages 10-11, 12 boys, 18 girls) from central England were randomly selected to participate in a 6 week, recess based, active video gaming intervention (n = 15) or act as controls (n = 15). Repeated measures analysis of covariance (controlling for body fatness) was used to examine any differences in physical activity, determined by pedometry and heart rate monitoring over time and between intervention and control groups. Main Findings. Children in the intervention accumulated significantly greater steps/day than the control group during the first week of the intervention. This pattern was reversed at the mid and end points of the intervention (p = .03). Irrespective of time point, children engaging in active video game play spent a lesser percentage of time engaged in MVPA than the controls undertaking 'traditional' recess activity (p = .0001). Conclusions. Active video game play does not appear to be a sustainable means to enhance children's physical activity. Although physical activity (steps/min) was greater on initial presentation of active video games compared to 'traditional' recess activity, this appears to be an acute effect.",doi,10.2478/v10038-009-0023-1,Scopus,Human Movement,"Duncan M.J., Staples V.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,The Impact Of Anxiety On Social Decision-Making: Behavioral And Electrodermal Findings,"Anxiety plays an important role in social behavior. For instance, high-anxious individuals are more likely to avoid such social interactions as communicating with strangers. In this study, we investigate the impact of anxiety on social decision-making. The classic ultimatum game (UG) paradigm was utilized in concert with skin conductance recording. Behavioral results reveal that when playing as responders, high-trait anxiety (HTA) participants with lower levels of self-esteem, as well as low-trait anxiety (LTA) participants with higher levels of impulsivity, were more likely to accept human-proposed inequitable offers. In addition, the HTA participants rejected more computer-proposed inequitable offers than did LTA participants. Moreover, the skin conductance response to inequitable offers was correlated with levels of anxiety in the HTA group, but not in the LTA group. In conclusion, people differing in levels of anxiety showed distinct behavior patterns and autonomic neural responses during social decision-making, whereas the levels of self-esteem, impulsivity, and depression might be additional moderating factors. These findings contextualize high-anxious people's avoidance tendency in social interaction. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",doi,10.1080/17470919.2012.694372,Scopus,Social Neuroscience,"Wu T., Luo Y., Broster L.S., Gu R., Luo Y.-J.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,The Impact Of Social Stress On Self-Esteem And Paranoid Ideation,"Background: Vulnerability-stress models propose that social stress triggers psychotic episodes in high risk individuals. Previous studies found not only stress but also a decrease in self-esteem to precede the formation of delusions. As evidence for causal conclusions has not been provided yet, the present study assessed the direct impact of social stress on paranoid beliefs using an experimental design and considered a decrease in self-esteem as a mediator and the proneness to psychosis and paranoia as moderators of the effect. Methods: A nonclinical population sample (n = 76) was randomly assigned to an experimental (EG) or a control group condition (CG). In the EG, participants were excluded during a virtual ball game (Cyberball) by the other two players and received a negative feedback after performing a test. The CG was included in the game and received a neutral feedback. Before and after the experimental conditions, emotions, self-esteem and paranoid beliefs were assessed using state-adapted questionnaires. Results: After the social stress induction, the EG reported a higher increase in subclinical paranoid beliefs compared to the CG. The impact of social stress on paranoid ideation was mediated by a decrease in self-esteem and moderated by proneness to paranoia. Individuals who felt distressed by paranoid thoughts at baseline were more likely to react with an increase in paranoid ideation under social stress. Limitations: The results need to be confirmed in a patient sample to draw conclusions about the processes involved in the formation of delusions in clinically relevant stages. Conclusions: The impact of social stress on symptom formation and self-esteem is discussed in terms of recent models of symptom formation and interventions in psychosis. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

,The Mind Module-Using An Affect And Personality Computational Model As A Game-Play Element,"This paper describes the Mind Module (MM) which can be used in game worlds to assign avatars and autonomous characters personality traits, emotions, emotional attachments and moods which together form finely granulated states which are especially appropriate in systems where individualized play experiences are desired. The MM is implemented as a spreading activation network where the different nodes represent affective properties and has been used in several experimental game prototypes. In this paper, results are reported from play-tests where representations of affective processes were used as game-play elements.

,The Neural Correlates Of The Affective Response To Unreciprocated Cooperation,"Humans excel at reciprocal altruism in which two individuals exchange altruistic acts to their mutual advantage. The evolutionary stability of this system depends on recognition of and discrimination against non-reciprocators, and the human mind is apparently specialized for detecting non-reciprocators. Here we investigate the neural response to non-reciprocation of cooperation by imaging human subjects with fMRI as they play an iterated Prisoner's dilemma game with two assumed human partners. Unreciprocated cooperation was associated with greater activity in bilateral anterior insula, left hippocampus and left lingual gyrus, compared with reciprocated cooperation. These areas were also more responsive to unreciprocated cooperation than to unsuccessful risk taking in a non-social context. Finally, functional connectivity between anterior insula and lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in response to unreciprocated cooperation predicted subsequent defection. The anterior insula is involved in awareness of visceral, autonomic feedback from the body and, in concert with the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, may be responsible for negative feeling states that bias subsequent social decision making against cooperation with a non-reciprocating partner. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

,The Oxytocin Receptor (Oxtr) Contributes To Prosocial Fund Allocations In The Dictator Game And The Social Value Orientations Task,"Background: Economic games observe social decision making in the laboratory that involves real money payoffs. Previously we have shown that allocation of funds in the Dictator Game (DG), a paradigm that illustrates costly altruistic behavior, is partially determined by promoter-region repeat region variants in the arginine vasopressin 1a receptor gene (AVPR1a). In the current investigation, the gene encoding the related oxytocin receptor (OXTR) was tested for association with the DG and a related paradigm, the Social Values Orientation (SVO) task. Methodology/Principal Findings: Association (101 male and 102 female students) using a robust-family based test between 15 single tagging SNPs (htSNPs) across the OXTR was demonstrated with both the DG and SVO. Three htSNPs across the gene region showed significant association with both of the two games. The most significant association was observed with rs1042778 (p=0.001). Haplotype analysis also showed significant associations for both DG and SVO. Following permutation test adjustment, significance was observed for 2-5 locus haplotypes (p<0.05). A second sample of 98 female subjects was subsequently and independently recruited to play the dictator game and was genotyped for the three significant SNPs found in the first sample. The rs1042778 SNP was shown to be significant for the second sample as well (p=0.004, Fisher's exact test). Conclusions: The demonstration that genetic polymorphisms for the OXTR are associated with human prosocial decision making converges with a large body of animal research showing that oxytocin is an important social hormone across vertebrates including Homo sapiens. Individual differences in prosocial behavior have been shown by twin studies to have a substantial genetic basis and the current investigation demonstrates that common variants in the oxytocin receptor gene, an important element of mammalian social circuitry, underlie such individual differences. © 2009 Israel et al.",doi,10.1371/journal.pone.0005535,Scopus,PLoS ONE,"Israel S., Lerer E., Shalev I., Uzefovsky F., Riebold M., Laiba E., Bachner-Melman R., Maril A., Bornstein G., Knafo A., Ebstein R.P.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,The Perception And Identification Of Facial Emotions In Individuals With Autism Spectrum Disorders Using The Let's Face It! Emotion Skills Battery,"Background: Although impaired social-emotional ability is a hallmark of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the perceptual skills and mediating strategies contributing to the social deficits of autism are not well understood. A perceptual skill that is fundamental to effective social communication is the ability to accurately perceive and interpret facial emotions. To evaluate the expression processing of participants with ASD, we designed the Let's Face It! Emotion Skills Battery (LFI! Battery), a computer-based assessment composed of three subscales measuring verbal and perceptual skills implicated in the recognition of facial emotions. Methods: We administered the LFI! Battery to groups of participants with ASD and typically developing control (TDC) participants that were matched for age and IQ. Results: On the Name Game labeling task, participants with ASD (N = 68) performed on par with TDC individuals (N = 66) in their ability to name the facial emotions of happy, sad, disgust and surprise and were only impaired in their ability to identify the angry expression. On the Matchmaker Expression task that measures the recognition of facial emotions across different facial identities, the ASD participants (N = 66) performed reliably worse than TDC participants (N = 67) on the emotions of happy, sad, disgust, frighten and angry. In the Parts-Wholes test of perceptual strategies of expression, the TDC participants (N = 67) displayed more holistic encoding for the eyes than the mouths in expressive faces whereas ASD participants (N = 66) exhibited the reverse pattern of holistic recognition for the mouth and analytic recognition of the eyes. Conclusion: In summary, findings from the LFI! Battery show that participants with ASD were able to label the basic facial emotions (with the exception of angry expression) on par with age- and IQ-matched TDC participants. However, participants with ASD were impaired in their ability to generalize facial emotions across different identities and showed a tendency to recognize the mouth feature holistically and the eyes as isolated parts. © 2012 The Authors.

,The Physiological Load Imposed On Basketball Players During Competition,"In this study, the intensities of activity and movement patterns during men’s basketball were investigated by videoing the movements and monitoring the heart rate and blood lactate responses of eight elite players during competition. The results are expressed according to ‘live time’, which is actual playing time, and ‘total time’, which includes live time as well as all stoppages in play. The mean (± s.d.) frequency of all activities was 997 ± 183, with a change in movement category every 2.0 s. A mean total of 105 ± 52 high-intensity runs (mean duration 1.7 s) was recorded for each game, resulting in one high-intensity run every 21 s during live time. Sixty percent of live time was spent engaged in low-intensity activity, while 15% was spent in high-intensity activity. The mean heart rate (HR) during live time was 169 ± 9 beats min-1 (89 ± 2% peak HR attained during laboratory testing); 75% of live time was spent with a HR response of greater than 85% peak HR. The mean blood lactate concentration was 6.8 ± 2.8 mM, indicating the involvement of glycolysis in the energy demands of basketball. It is concluded that the physiological requirements of men’s basketball are high, placing considerable demands on the cardiovascular and metabolic capacities of players. © 1995, E. &amp; F.N.

,The Production And Recognition Of Emotions In Speech: Features And Algorithms,"This paper presents algorithms that allow a robot to express its emotions by modulating the intonation of its voice. They are very simple and efficiently provide life-like speech thanks to the use of concatenative speech synthesis. We describe a technique which allows to continuously control both the age of a synthetic voice and the quantity of emotions that are expressed. Also, we present the first large-scale data mining experiment about the automatic recognition of basic emotions in informal everyday short utterances. We focus on the speaker-dependent problem. We compare a large set of machine learning algorithms, ranging from neural networks, Support Vector Machines or decision trees, together with 200 features, using a large database of several thousands examples. We show that the difference of performance among learning schemes can be substantial, and that some features which were previously unexplored are of crucial importance. An optimal feature set is derived through the use of a genetic algorithm. Finally, we explain how this study can be applied to real world situations in which very few examples are available. Furthermore, we describe a game to play with a personal robot which facilitates teaching of examples of emotional utterances in a natural and rather unconstrained manner. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

,The Psychophysiology Of Digital Gaming: The Effect Of A Non Co-Located Opponent,"This article examines the effects of a non co-located opponent on self-reported emotions, psychophysiological responses, and presence experiences during digital game playing. In a within-subjects design, participants played Super Monkey Ball Jr. and Duke Nukem Advance against a computer, a non co-located friend, and a non co-located stranger. In addition to self-report ratings, electromyographic (EMG) activity over zygomaticus major, corrugator supercilii, and orbicularis oculi; cardiac interbeat intervals; and skin conductance level were measured to index positive activation, negative activation, and physiological arousal. When compared to playing against a computer, playing against a human elicited more positive emotional responses and higher arousal, spatial presence, and engagement. In addition, playing against a friend elicited more positive emotional responses (as indexed by facial EMG) and higher self-reported arousal and engagement compared to playing against a stranger. The influence of opponent type on facial EMG responses was dependent on dispositional behavioral activation system (BAS) and behavioral inhibition system (BIS) sensitivities of the player. Orbicularis oculi EMG responses to game violence varied also as a function of the player's impulsivity. These data show that the mere knowledge of who is controlling the opponent character strongly influences emotional and other responses to digital games. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",doi,10.1080/15213260903052240,Scopus,Media Psychology,Ravaja N.,2009,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,The Racing-Game Effect: Why Do Video Racing Games Increase Risk-Taking Inclinations?,"The present studies investigated why video racing games increase players' risk-taking inclinations. Four studies reveal that playing video racing games increases risk taking in a subsequent simulated road traffic situation, as well as risk-promoting cognitions and emotions, blood pressure, sensation seeking, and attitudes toward reckless driving. Study 1 ruled out the role of experimental demand in creating such effects. Studies 2 and 3 showed that the effect of playing video racing games on risk taking was partially mediated by changes in self-perceptions as a reckless driver. These effects were evident only when the individual played racing games that reward traffic violations rather than racing games that do not reward traffic violations (Study 3) and when the individual was an active player of such games rather than a passive observer (Study 4). In sum, the results underline the potential negative impact of racing games on traffic safety. © 2009 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.",doi,10.1177/0146167209339628,Scopus,Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin,"Fischer P., Greitemeyer T., Morton T., Kastenmüller A., Postmes T., Frey D., Kubitzki J., Odenwälder J.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,"The Relationship Between Cell Phone Use, Physical And Sedentary Activity, And Cardiorespiratory Fitness In A Sample Of U.s. College Students","Background: Today's cell phones increase opportunities for activities traditionally defined as sedentary behaviors (e.g., surfing the internet, playing video games). People who participate in large amounts of sedentary behaviors, relative to those who do not, tend to be less physically active, less physically fit, and at greater risk for health problems. However, cell phone use does not have to be a sedentary behavior as these devices are portable. It can occur while standing or during mild-to-moderate intensity physical activity. Thus, the relationship between cell phone use, physical and sedentary activity, and physical fitness is unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate these relationships among a sample of healthy college students.Methods: Participants were first interviewed about their physical activity behavior and cell phone use. Then body composition was assessed and the validated self-efficacy survey for exercise behaviors completed. This was followed by a progressive exercise test on a treadmill to exhaustion. Peak oxygen consumption (VO2 peak) during exercise was used to measure cardiorespiratory fitness. Hierarchical regression was used to assess the relationship between cell phone use and cardiorespiratory fitness after controlling for sex, self-efficacy, and percent body fat. Interview data was transcribed, coded, and Chi-square analysis was used to compare the responses of low and high frequency cell phone users.Results: Cell phone use was significantly (p = 0.047) and negatively (β = -0.25) related to cardio respiratory fitness independent of sex, self-efficacy, and percent fat which were also significant predictors (p &lt; 0.05). Interview data offered several possible explanations for this relationship. First, high frequency users were more likely than low frequency users to report forgoing opportunities for physical activity in order to use their cell phones for sedentary behaviors. Second, low frequency users were more likely to report being connected to active peer groups through their cell phones and to cite this as a motivation for physical activity. Third, high levels of cell phone use indicated a broader pattern of sedentary behaviors apart from cell phone use, such as watching television.Conclusion: Cell phone use, like traditional sedentary behaviors, may disrupt physical activity and reduce cardiorespiratory fitness. © 2013 Lepp et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",doi,10.1186/1479-5868-10-79,Scopus,International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity,"Lepp A., Barkley J.E., Sanders G.J., Rebold M., Gates P.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,The Utility Of A Video Game System In Rehabilitation Of Burn And Nonburn Patients: A Survey Among Occupational Therapy And Physiotherapy Practitioners,"The objective of this study was to investigate perceptions of occupational therapists and physiotherapists on the use of Nintendo Wii™ (Nintendo of America Inc., Redmond, WA) in rehabilitation. Occupational therapists and physiotherapists in a rehabilitation hospital trialed four Wii games that addressed physical movement, balance, coordination, and cognitive performance. Then, they completed an opinion survey on the utility of Wii in rehabilitation. The results were compared between burn care therapists (BTs) and nonburn care therapists, using χ with a P < .05 considered significant. The participation rate was 79% (63/80), and they agreed that Wii was easy to set up (71%), operate (68%), and safe to use (76%). Participants agreed that Wii would be beneficial in outpatient (76%) and inpatient (65%) settings and that it could improve treatment compliance (73%). Participants recommended 15 to 30-minute Wii intervention (59%) daily (81%) and twice per week (43%). Participants believed that neurologic (71%), trauma (68%), burn (59%), and musculoskeletal (49%) patients would benefit from Wii intervention but not cardiac (43%) or organ transplant patients (18%). Participants believed that outcomes using Wii could be measured reliably (49%), and skills learned while playing could be transferable to daily function (60%). The significant differences between BTs and nonburn care therapists' perceptions are that BT-treated younger patients (21-40 years vs >60 years, P < .05) and BT favored the therapeutic benefit of Wii in rehabilitation (93% vs 58%, P = .02), specifically in burn rehabilitation (85% vs 39%, P = .001). Occupational therapists and physiotherapists favored the use of Wii in rehabilitation as an adjunct to traditional therapy because it is therapeutic, engaging, and may increase patient participation in rehabilitation. © 2010 by the American Burn Association.",doi,10.1097/BCR.0b013e3181eed23c,Scopus,Journal of Burn Care and Research,"Fung V., So K., Park E., Ho A., Shaffer J., Chan E., Gomez M.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,The Winner Takes It All: The Effect Of In-Game Success And Need Satisfaction On Mood Repair And Enjoyment,"Recent research found that playing video games is able to serve mood management purposes as well as contribute to gratifications such as need satisfaction. Both aspects can foster the enjoyment as entertainment experience. The current study explores the question of how in-game success as a prerequisite for satisfying the need for competence and autonomy positively influences mood repair and game enjoyment. In a laboratory setting, participants were frustrated via a highly stressing math task and then played a video game (Mario Kart). Results show that in-game success drives mood repair as reflected in the experience of anger, happiness and activation. Moreover, fulfilling the intrinsic needs for competence and autonomy mediated the effects of in-game success and predicted enjoyment of the video game. Results are discussed in context of recent conceptualizations of media entertainment and the hierarchical order of emotional gratifications. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

,To Plan Or To Simply React? An Experimental Study Of Action Planning In A Game Environment,"Many contemporary computer games, notably action and role-playing games, represent an interesting class of navigation-intensive dynamic real-time simulations inhabited by autonomous intelligent virtual agents (IVAs). Although higher level reasoning of IVAs in these domains seems suited for action planning, planning is not widely adopted in existing games and similar applications. Moreover, statistically rigorous study measuring performance of planners in decision making in a game-like domain is missing. Here, five classical planners were connected to the virtual environment of Unreal Development Kit along with a planner for delete-free domains (only positive preconditions and positive effects). Performance of IVAs employing those planners and IVAs with reactive architecture was measured on a class of game-inspired test environments of various sizes and under different levels of external interference. The analysis has shown that planning agents outperform reactive agents if (i) the size of the problem is small or if (b) the environment changes are either hostile to the agent or infrequent. In delete-free domains, specialized approaches are inferior to classical planners because the lower expressivity of delete-free domains results in lower plan quality. These results can help to determine when planning is advantageous in games and for IVAs control in other dynamic real-time environments. ©2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",doi,10.1111/coin.12079,Scopus,Computational Intelligence,"Černý M., Barták R., Brom C., Gemrot J.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,"Toward A Conceptual Model Of Motive And Self-Control In Cyber-Aggression: Rage, Revenge, Reward, And Recreation","Despite widespread public attention to cyberbullying, online aggression and victimization have received scant conceptual development. This article focuses on how opportunities for aggression are distinct online from those of offline social contexts. The model developed here is informed by a recent aggression typology, which extends the reactive-proactive distinction by distinguishing aggression based on the affective motive (appetitive vs. reactive) and the recruitment of self-control. This typology informs an analysis of psychological processes linked to individual differences that are relevant to adolescents' aggressive activities. Processes implicated include hostile schema activation, anger and fatigue effects on self-control, anger rumination, empathic failure, excitation transfer, and thrill-seeking. With these processes established, the proposed model focuses on how features of online social platforms may afford opportunities for distinct types of aggression by engaging these processes in adolescent users. Features of online settings that present distinct opportunities for activation of these processes are reviewed for each process, including social cue ambiguity, temporal lag, cue permanence, anonymity, the continual perception of audience, and the availability of online gaming and online pornography. For each of the conceptually grounded cyber-aggression-relevant processes, implications for innovative research directions on adolescent cyber-aggression are presented. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",doi,10.1007/s10964-013-9936-2,Scopus,Journal of Youth and Adolescence,Runions K.C.,2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Traumatic Rupture Of A Meckel's Diverticulum Due To Blunt Abdominal Trauma In A Soccer Game: A Case Report,"Introduction a Meckel's diverticulum is one of the most common congenital anomalies of the digestive tract. The reported lifetime complication rate is 4%, mostly due to hemorrhage, obstruction, perforation or inflammation. A symptomatic Meckel's diverticulum due to rupture after blunt abdominal trauma is very rare. We believe this case report is the first reporting a rupture of a Meckel's diverticulum after a low velocity blunt abdominal trauma and outlining the importance of a thorough and complete examination of the patient after blunt abdominal trauma. Presentation of case a 17-year-old male presented with abdominal pain after blunt abdominal trauma during a soccer game. Physical examination showed signs of peritonitis in all quadrants of the abdomen. During admission the patient deteriorated with decreasing blood pressure and raising pulse rate. A CT-scan showed free abdominal fluid. Our patient was scheduled for an emergent laparotomy where a perforated Meckel's diverticulum with fecal spill was found. A segmental ileal resection was performed. Post-operative, patient developed a pneumonia and also intra-abdominal abscesses treated with percutaneous drainage. After an admission period of 17-days the patient was discharged. Conclusion perforation of a Meckel's diverticulum is rarely suspected as a cause of acute deterioration following blunt abdominal trauma. This case shows the importance of awareness of this kind of injury especially in male patients. © 2015 The Authors.

,Tunnel Vision Or Desensitization? The Effect Of Interactivity And Frequency Of Use On The Perception And Evaluation Of Violence In Digital Games,"Most of the studies on violence in digital games have investigated its effects on arousal or aggression. Little attention has been paid to how in-game violence is actually perceived and evaluated. To investigate this issue we conducted two experimental studies (N = 30 and N = 74) in which participants either played or watched a violent shooter game and reported how they perceived and evaluated the violent content. Results showed that playing the games led to an increased awareness for in-game violence, but also to less-negative subjective evaluations of the violent content. Gaming frequency had a negative effect on both the perception and evaluation of in-game violence, suggesting a desensitization effect. The results of our studies illustrate that individual perceptions and evaluations of violence in digital games have to be taken into account when studying their effects. Implications for further research and the system of age ratings are discussed based on our findings.",doi,10.1027/1864-1105/a000122,Scopus,Journal of Media Psychology,"Breuer J., Scharkow M., Quandt T.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Ultradian Rhythmicity And Induced Changes In Salivary Testosterone,"Testosterone and cortisol respond to exercise stimuli and modulate adaptation. Episodic basal secretion of these hormones may modify the responsiveness of these hormones. We sought to identify episodic steroid secretion via frequent salivary sampling and investigate any interaction between ultradian rhythmicity and induced changes in testosterone. Salivary testosterone and cortisol concentrations of seven males (age 20-40 years) were measured every 10 min between 0800 and1600 h on three consecutive days. On either the second or third day, three interventions designed to elicit a hormonal response were randomly assigned: sprint exercise (two 30-s maximal efforts on a cycle ergometer); boxing (two 30-s maximal punching efforts); and a violent video game (10 min of player vs. player combat). On the other days subjects were inactive. Testosterone data on non-intervention days suggested pulsatile secretion with a pulse interval of 47 ± 9 min (mean ± SD). The sprint intervention substantially affected hormones: it elicited a small transient elevation in testosterone (by a factor of 1.21; factor 90% confidence limits ×/÷1.21) 10 min after exercise, and a moderate elevation in cortisol peaking 50 min post-exercise (factor 2.3; ×/÷2.6). The testosterone response correlated with the change in testosterone concentration in the 10 min prior to the sprint (r = 0.78; 90% CL 0.22-0.95) and with a measure of randomness in testosterone fluctuations (r = 0.83; 0.35-0.96). Thus, the salivary testosterone response to exercise may be dependent on the underlying ultradian rhythm and aspects of its regulation. This interaction may have important implications for adaptation to exercise. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",doi,10.1007/s00421-010-1518-3,Scopus,European Journal of Applied Physiology,"Beaven C.M., Ingram J.R., Gill N.D., Hopkins W.G.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Understanding The Interplay Of Model Complexity And Fidelity In Multiagent Systems Via An Evolutionary Framework,"Modern video games come with highly realistic graphics enabling the players to interact with visually rich virtual worlds. Realistic (life-like) animation of nonplayer characters (NPCs) in such virtual worlds is particularly important to enhance the gaming experience. Multiagent systems are one effective approach to synthesize life-like behaviors and interactions by codifying simple rules into NPCs (each NPC as an autonomous agent). However, such behaviors generally come at the cost of increasing computational expense and complexity in terms of aspects such as number of rules and parameters. Therefore, the desire for high fidelity (highly realistic) behaviors is often in conflict with the drive for low complexity. Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms provide a sophisticated mechanism to optimize two or more conflicting objectives simultaneously. However, evolutionary computing techniques need an appropriate objective function to drive the exploration in the correct direction. Pairing of evolutionary techniques and multiagent systems is challenging in the classes of problems in which the fitness is evaluated based on human aesthetic judgment rather than on objective forms of measurements. In this study, we present a multiobjective evolutionary framework to evolve low complexity and high fidelity multiagent systems by utilizing a machine learning system trained by bootstrapping human aesthetic judgment. We have gathered empirical data in three problem areas - simulation of conversational group dynamics, sheepdog herding behaviors, and traffic dynamics, and show the effectiveness of our approach in deriving low complexity and high fidelity multiagent systems. Further, we have identified common properties of the Pareto-optimal frontiers in the three problem areas that can ultimately lead to an understanding of a relationship between simulation model complexity and behavior fidelity. This understanding will be useful in deciding which level of behavioral fidelity is required for the characters in video games based on the distance to the camera, importance to the scene, and available computational resources. © 2009-2012 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TCIAIG.2016.2560882,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games,"Lakshika E., Barlow M., Easton A.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Use Of Information And Communication Technology (Ict) And Perceived Health In Adolescence: The Role Of Sleeping Habits And Waking-Time Tiredness,"The first aim for this paper was to examine gender and age differences in the intensity of usage of information and communication technology (ICT: computer for digital playing, writing and e-mailing and communication, and Internet surfing, and mobile phone). Second, we modelled the possible mediating role of sleeping habits and waking-time tiredness in the association between ICT usage and perceived health (health complaints, musculoskeletal symptoms, health status). The participants were 7292 Finns aged 12, 14, 16 and 18 years responding to a postal enquiry (response rate 70%). The results showed that boys played digital games and used Internet more often than girls, whose mobile phone usage was more intensive. Structural equation model analyses substantiated the mediating hypothesis: intensive ICT-usage was associated with poor perceived health particularly or only when it negatively affected sleeping habits, which in turn was associated with increased waking-time tiredness. The associations were gender-specific especially among older adolescents (16- and 18-year olds). Intensive computer usage forms a risk for boys', and intensive mobile phone usage for girls' perceived health through the mediating links. Girls were vulnerable to the negative consequences of intensive mobile phone usage, as it associated with perceived health complaints and musculoskeletal symptoms both directly and through deteriorated sleep and increased waking-time tiredness. The results of gender-specific ICT usage and vulnerability are discussed as reflecting gendered psychophysiological, psychological and social developmental demands. © 2006 The Association for Professionals in Services for Adolescents.",doi,10.1016/j.adolescence.2006.07.004,Scopus,Journal of Adolescence,"Punamäki R.-L., Wallenius M., Nygård C.-H., Saarni L., Rimpelä A.",2007,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,User Experience In Digital Games: Differences Between Laboratory And Home,"Playing entertainment computer, video, and portable games, namely, digital games, is receiving more and more attention in academic research. Games are studied in different situations with numerous methods, but little is known about if and how the playing situation affects the user experience (UX) in games. In addition, it is hard to understand and study the psychology of UX in games. The objective of this study is to show how UX differs when the first-person shooter HALO is played in a laboratory and at home. To disclose this difference, a psychologically valid and multidimensional measurement framework is introduced. UX is profiled according to the level of the sense of presence, involvement, and flow in a between-subjects design. Statistically, the structure of the framework is grounded on a large and heterogeneous gamer data set (N = 2,182). The results showed that the profile of the sense of presence in the laboratory included higher levels of attention and arousal as compared with that of the natural environment. This finding was independent of any of the measured background variables. Other differences between the two situations were more related to the participants' background. For example, gamers at home were more involved in the game and they felt a higher level of competence. No strong emotional differences between the two situations were found. The authors discuss the complex UX terminology and implications of the framework for implementation of learning games. © 2011 SAGE Publications.",doi,10.1177/1046878110378353,Scopus,Simulation and Gaming,"Takatalo J., Häkkinen J., Kaistinen J., Nyman G.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia

,Using A Videogame To Facilitate Nursing And Medical Students' First Visit To The Operating Theatre. A Randomized Controlled Trial,"Background First experiences in the operating theatre with real patients are always stressful and intimidating for students. We hypothesized that a game-like simulation could improve perceptions and performance of novices. Methods A videogame was developed, combining pictures and short videos, by which students are interactively instructed on acting at the surgical block. Moreover, the game includes detailed descriptive information. After playing, students are given feedback on their performance. A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 132 nursing and medical students with no previous experience in surgery. Sixty two (47.0%) were allocated to a control group (CG) and 70 (53.0%) to an experimental group (EG). Subjects in EG played the game the day prior to their first experience in the theatre; CG had no access to the application. On the day after their experience at surgery, all students filled in a questionnaire in a 7-point Likert format collecting subjective data about their experience in the surgical block. Four constructs related to students' feelings, emotions and attitudes were measured through self-reported subjective scales, i.e. C1: fear to make mistakes, C2: perceived knowledge on how to behave, C3: perceived errors committed, and C4: attitude/behaviour towards patients and staff. The main research question was formulated as follows: do students show differences in constructs C1–C4 by exposure to the game? Results EG reported statistically significant higher scores on the four aspects measured than CG (p < 0.05; Mann-Whitney U tests; Cohen's d standardized effect size d1 = 0.30; d2 = 1.05; d3 = 0.39; d4 = 0.49). Conclusions Results show clear evidence that the exposure to the game-like simulation had a significant positive effect on all the constructs. After their first visit to the theatre, students in EG showed less fear (C1) and also perceived to have committed fewer errors (C3), while they showed higher perceived knowledge (C2) and a more collaborative attitude (C4). © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",doi,10.1016/j.nedt.2017.04.026,Scopus,Nurse Education Today,"del Blanco Á., Torrente J., Fernández-Manjón B., Ruiz P., Giner M.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Using An Educational Multimedia Application To Prepare Children For Outpatient Surgeries,"Surgery is a highly stressful event for children and caregivers. Extensive effort has been made to improve preoperative care in order to alleviate worry about the surgical procedure itself. This study tested the impact of an educational multimedia intervention on the cognitive, emotional, and physiological responses of children undergoing surgery, as well as on parental state anxiety. Children (n = 90) were assigned to three different groups: an educational multimedia intervention (experimental group), an entertainment video game intervention (comparison group), and a control group (no intervention). Children who received the educational multimedia intervention reported lower level of worries about hospitalization, medical procedures, illness, and negative consequences than those in the control and in the comparison groups. Parental state anxiety was also lower in the both the educational and the entertainment video game interventions compared to the control group. These findings suggest that providing information to children regarding medical procedures and hospital rules and routines is important to reduce their preoperative worries, and also relevant for parental anxiety.

While the findings of this study are valuable to game developers interested in providing additional dimensions to gameplay and testing, they may also be useful for those researching medical or therapeutic applications for games. The results suggest that although the tested game was inherently challenging and enjoyable, the adaptive affective gameplay was not altering the game enough to induce strong physiological or emotional responses from participants. Biofeedback games lend themselves to medical applications, but adaptive affective games can be used to respond sympathetically to the player without requiring direct control of physiological responses as a form of input. © 2013, IGI Global.",doi,10.4018/ijgbl.2013070103,Scopus,International Journal of Game-Based Learning,"Charij S., Oikonomou A.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Using The Wiimote To Learn Mems In A Physics Degree Program,"This paper describes a learning experience designed to introduce students in a Micro-and Nanosystems course in a Physics Bachelor's degree program to the use of professional tools for the design and characterization of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) through a specific commercial case: the MEMS used by the well-known gaming platform Nintendo Wii. For this project, all the MEMS' fabrication steps were adapted to a teaching environment, from its design using specific software, to its experimental characterization after fabrication. The implementation of this learning strategy enhances students' learning autonomy while fostering multidirectional learning and active feedback between teachers and students. This innovative approach allows students to carry out collaborative work in a realistic environment and serves to introduce science students to tools and workflow typical of the engineering field. Although this learning strategy is particularized for students in a Micro-and Nanosystems course of a Physics Bachelor's degree program, it can be adapted to students of any scientific technical degree. © 2015 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TE.2015.2472639,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Education,"Sanchez-Azqueta C., Gimeno C., Celma S., Aldea C.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Validating The Distinction Between Computer Addiction And Engagement: Online Game Playing And Personality,"This article considers validatory evidence for the previously made distinction between (pathological) computing-related addictions and (non-pathological) high engagement in computing activities, and an associated distinction between core and peripheral criteria for diagnosing computing-related addictions. Using data provided by 388 players of a massively multiplayer online role playing game (MMORPG) via an online questionnaire, psychometric measures of engagement and addiction to the MMORPG taking into account the distinction between core and peripheral addiction criteria are shown to be differentially related to personality factors (extraversion, emotional stability, agreeableness, negative valence, and attractiveness). Addiction scale scores are shown to increase as negativity on all five personality characteristics increases, with these characteristics predicting 20% of the variance in addiction scores, but the same pattern is shown to occur for only one characteristic (negative valence) for the engagement scale, with personality characteristics predicting only around 2% of the variance in engagement scores. It is concluded that there is reasonable support for the distinctions between addiction and engagement and between core and peripheral criteria. Implications are discussed. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.",doi,10.1080/01449290903401978,Scopus,Behaviour and Information Technology,"Charlton J.P., Danforth I.D.W.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Vanishing Scares: Biofeedback Modulation Of Affective Player Experiences In A Procedural Horror Game,"To understand the impact of emotionally driven games on player experience, we developed a procedural horror game (Vanish) capable of run-time level, asset, and event generation. Vanish was augmented to interpret players’ physiological data as a simplified emotional state, mapping it to a set of adaptation rules that modify the player experience. To explore the effects of adaptation mechanisms on player experience, we conducted a mixed-methods study on three different versions of the game, two of which integrated varying biofeedback mechanisms. Players’ affective experiences were objectively measured by analysing physiological data. Additionally, subjective experience was recorded through the use of the Game Experience Questionnaire. Our study confirmed that biofeedback functionality had a statistically significant effect on the ratings of player experience dimensions: immersion, tension, positive affect, and negative affect. Furthermore, participants reported noticeable differences in player experience, favouring the added depth present in the biofeedback-enabled iterations of the game. In the future, these conclusions will help to develop more immersive and engaging player experiences. © 2015, OpenInterface Association.",doi,10.1007/s12193-015-0208-1,Scopus,Journal on Multimodal User Interfaces,"Nogueira P.A., Torres V., Rodrigues R., Oliveira E., Nacke L.E.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Variables Associated With Physical Fighting Among U.s. High-School Students.,"Background Violence among adolescents is an important public health problem in the United States. This study was conducted to estimate the prevalence of having been engaged in physical fighting on school property and associated factors of the behavior among school-going adolescents in the United States. Methods This study was based on secondary analysis of the United States Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) conducted in 2005. The sampling frame included all private and public school in the country, stratified by region and urbanicity based on the US census bureau data. Frequencies and proportions were obtained for the outcome and explanatory variables. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the level of association between explanatory variables and the outcome (having been involved in a physical fight). Results Of the 13,857 respondents, 13.5% (18.2% for males and 8.8% for females) reported physical fighting onschool property in the last 12 months to the survey. Males were more likely to have been in a physical fight than females (OR = 2.23; 95% CI [1.89, 2.63]). Respondents aged 17 years or older were less likely to report physical fighting than those who were 14 years or younger. Compared to Whites, American Indians or Alaska Natives, Blacks, Native Hawaii or other Pacific Islanders, and Hispanics were more likely to report physical fighting on school property (OR = 2.11; 95% CI [1.22, 3.66], OR = 1.72; 95% CI [1.42, 2.0], OR = 2.18; 95% CI [1.01, 4.79], and OR = 1.74; 95% CI [1.41, 2.16] respectively). Physical fighting on school property was also positively associated with cigarette smoking (OR = 1.70; 95% CI [1.37, 2.10]), drinking alcohol (OR = 1.45; 95% CI [1.20, 1.76]), use of illegal drugs (OR = 1.73; 95% CI [1.42, 2.12]), having had property stolen or deliberately damaged on school property (OR = 2.06; 95% CI [1.74, 2.44]), having been threatened or injured with a weapon on school property (OR = 2.63; 95% CI [2.06, 3.34]), and playing videogame three or more hours a day (OR = 1.29; 95% CI [1.07, 1.56]). Conclusion These findings suggest that physical fighting among US High School students is widespread and positively associated with victimization (having been threatened or injured with a weapon on school property) and other risky behaviors such as smoking, alcohol and drugs use. Intervention programs to prevent/control those risky behaviors as well as further attention on the association between physical fighting and victimization at school through longitudinal research are warranted.",doi,10.1186/1745-0179-4-16,anderson2010,Clinical Practice and Epidemiology in Mental Health,"Rudatsikira, E., Muula, A.

,Verification Of Games In The Game Description Language,"The Game Description Language (GDL) is a special purpose declarative language for defining games. GDL is used in the AAAI General Game Playing Competition, which tests the ability of computer programs to play games in general, rather than just the ability to play a specific game. Participants in the competition are provided with a previously unknown game specified in GDL, and are required to dynamically and autonomously determine how best to play this game. Recently, there has been much interest in the use of strategic cooperation logics for reasoning about game-like scenarios - the Alternating-time Temporal Logic (ATL) of Alur, Henzinger, and Kupferman is perhaps the best known example. Such logics are specifically intended to support reasoning about game-theoretic properties of multi-agent systems. In short, the aim of this article is to make a concrete link between ATL and GDL, with the ultimate goal of using ATL to reason about GDL-specified games. We make the following contributions. First, we demonstrate that GDL can be understood as a specification language for ATL models, and prove that the problem of interpreting ATL formulae over propositional GDL descriptions is EXPTIME-complete. Second, we use ATL to characterize a class of 'fair playability' conditions, which might or might not hold of various games.",doi,10.1093/logcom/exp039,Scopus,Journal of Logic and Computation,"Ruan J., Van Der Hoek W., Wooldridge M.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Video Game Playing Increases Food Intake In Adolescents: A Randomized Crossover Study,"Background: Video game playing has been linked to obesity in many observational studies. However, the influence of this sedentary activity on food intake is unknown. Objective: The objective was to examine the acute effects of sedentary video game play on various components of energy balance. Design: With the use of a randomized crossover design, 22 healthy, normal-weight, male adolescents (mean ± SD age: 16.7 ± 1.1 y) completed two 1-h experimental conditions, namely video game play and rest in a sitting position, followed by an ad libitum lunch. The endpoints were spontaneous food intake, energy expenditure, stress markers, appetite sensations, and profiles of appetite-related hormones. Results: Heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, sympathetic tone, and mental workload were significantly higher during the video game play condition than during the resting condition (P < 0.05). Although energy expenditure was significantly higher during video game play than during rest (mean increase over resting: 89 kJ; P < 0.01), ad libitum energy intake after video game play exceeded that measured after rest by 335 kJ (P < 0.05). A daily energy surplus of 682 kJ (163 kcal) over resting (P , 0.01) was observed in the video game play condition. The increase in food intake associated with video game play was observed without increased sensations of hunger and was not compensated for during the rest of the day. Finally, the profiles of glucose, insulin, cortisol, and ghrelin did not suggest an up-regulation of appetite during the video game play condition. Conclusion: A single session of video game play in healthy male adolescents is associated with an increased food intake, regardless of appetite sensations.

,Video Game Playing Is Independently Associated With Blood Pressure And Lipids In Overweight And Obese Adolescents,"Objective: To examine the association between duration and type of screen time (TV, video games, computer time) and blood pressure (BP) and lipids in overweight and obese adolescents. Design: This is a cross-sectional study of 282 overweight or obese adolescents aged 14-18 years (86 males, 196 females) assessed at baseline prior to beginning a lifestyle intervention study for weight control. Sedentary behaviours, defined as hours per day spent watching TV, playing video games, recreational computer use and total screen time were measured by self-report. We examined the associations between sedentary behaviours and BP and lipids using multiple linear regression. Results: Seated video gaming was the only sedentary behaviour associated with elevated BP and lipids before and after adjustment for age, sex, pubertal stage, parental education, body mass index (BMI), caloric intake, percent intake in dietary fat, physical activity (PA) duration, and PA intensity. Specifically, video gaming remained positively associated with systolic BP (adjusted r = 0.13, β = 1.1, p<0.05) and total cholesterol/HDL ratio (adjusted r = 0.12, β = 0.14, p<0.05). Conclusions: Playing video games was the only form of sedentary behaviour that was independently associated with increased BP and lipids. Our findings provide support for reducing time spent playing seated video games as a possible means to promote health and prevent the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in this high risk group of overweight and obese adolescents. Future research is needed to first replicate these findings and subsequently aim to elucidate the mechanisms linking seated video gaming and elevated BP and lipids in this high risk population.

,Video Game Therapy For Emotional Regulation And Impulsivity Control In A Series Of Treated Cases With Bulimia Nervosa,"Although standard psychological treatments have been successful in treating several core features in eating disorders (ED), other characteristics such as emotional regulation or impulsivity appear to be more resistant to change. There is a growing body of evidence to support the efficacy of cognitive remediation for cognitive and emotional difficulties in ED. Playmancer/ Islands is a video game (VG) designed to specifically treat mental disorders, characterized by problems in impulse control. The objective of the game is to increase self-control over emotions, decision making and behaviours. The aim of this study is to describe the results from a consecutive series of nine bulimia nervosa patients who were treated with the VG in addition to cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT). The outcomes included clinical and psychopathological questionnaires, and physiological measures were obtained during the VG. Emotional regulation improved, heart rate variability increased, and respiratory rate and impulsivity measures reduced after the treatment. These findings suggest that VG training may enhance treatment for ED. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and Eating Disorders Association.

,Video Gaming And Children’s Psychosocial Wellbeing: A Longitudinal Study,"The effects of video games on children’s psychosocial development remain the focus of debate. At two timepoints, 1 year apart, 194 children (7.27–11.43 years old; male = 98) reported their gaming frequency, and their tendencies to play violent video games, and to game (a) cooperatively and (b) competitively; likewise, parents reported their children’s psychosocial health. Gaming at time one was associated with increases in emotion problems. Violent gaming was not associated with psychosocial changes. Cooperative gaming was not associated with changes in prosocial behavior. Finally, competitive gaming was associated with decreases in prosocial behavior, but only among children who played video games with high frequency. Thus, gaming frequency was related to increases in internalizing but not externalizing, attention, or peer problems, violent gaming was not associated with increases in externalizing problems, and for children playing approximately 8 h or more per week, frequent competitive gaming may be a risk factor for decreasing prosocial behavior. We argue that replication is needed and that future research should better distinguish between different forms of gaming for more nuanced and generalizable insight. © 2017, The Author(s).",doi,10.1007/s10964-017-0646-z,Scopus,Journal of Youth and Adolescence,"Lobel A., Engels R.C.M.E., Stone L.L., Burk W.J., Granic I.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Violent Media Consumption And The Recognition Of Dynamic Facial Expressions,"This study assessed the speed of recognition of facial emotional expressions (happy and angry) as a function of violent media consumption. Color photos of calm facial expressions morphed to either an angry or a happy facial expression. Participants were asked to make a speeded identification of the emotion (happiness or anger) during the morph. Results indicated that, independent of trait aggressiveness, participants high in violent media consumption responded slower to depictions of happiness and faster to depictions of anger than participants low in violent media consumption. Implications of these findings are discussed with respect to current models of aggressive behavior. © 2006 Sage Publications.",doi,10.1177/0886260506286840,Scopus,Journal of Interpersonal Violence,"Kirsh S.J., Mounts J.R.W., Olczak P.V.",2006,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,"Violent Video Game Effects Remain A Societal Concern: Reply To Hilgard, Engelhardt, And Rouder (2017).","A large meta-analysis by Anderson et al. (2010) found that violent video games increased aggressive thoughts, angry feelings, physiological arousal, and aggressive behavior and decreased empathic feelings and helping behavior. Hilgard, Engelhardt, and Rouder (2017) reanalyzed the data of Anderson et al. (2010) using newer publication bias methods (i.e., precision-effect test, precision-effect estimate with standard error, p-uniform, p-curve). Based on their reanalysis, Hilgard, Engelhardt, and Rouder concluded that experimental studies examining the effect of violent video games on aggressive affect and aggressive behavior may be contaminated by publication bias, and these effects are very small when corrected for publication bias. However, the newer methods Hilgard, Engelhardt, and Rouder used may not be the most appropriate. Because publication bias is a potential a problem in any scientific domain, we used a comprehensive sensitivity analysis battery to examine the influence of publication bias and outliers on the experimental effects reported by Anderson et al. We used best meta-analytic practices and the triangulation approach to locate the likely position of the true mean effect size estimates. Using this methodological approach, we found that the combined adverse effects of outliers and publication bias was less severe than what Hilgard, Engelhardt, and Rouder found for publication bias alone. Moreover, the obtained mean effects using recommended methods and practices were not very small in size. The results of the methods used by Hilgard, Engelhardt, and Rouder tended to not converge well with the results of the methods we used, indicating potentially poor performance. We therefore conclude that violent video game effects should remain a societal concern.

,Virtual Reality As A Method For Evaluation And Therapy After Traumatic Hand Surgery,"In the last decade, Virtual Reality has encountered a continuous development concerning medical purposes and there are a lot of devices based on the classic 'cyberglove' concept that are used as new therapeutic method for upper limb pathology, especially neurologic problems [1;2;3]. One of the VR devices is Pablo (Tyromotion), with very sensitive sensors that can measure the hand grip strenght and the pinch force, also the ROM (range of motion) for all the joints of the upper limb (shoulder, elbow, wrist) and offering the possibility of interactive games based on Virtual Reality concept with application in occupational therapy programs. We used Pablo in our study on patients with hand surgery as an objective tool for assessment and as additional therapeutic method to the classic Rehabilitation program [4;5]. The results of the study proved that Pablo represents a modern option for evaluation of hand deficits and dysfunctions, with objective measurement replacement of classic goniometry and dynamometry, with computerized data base of patients with monitoring of parameters during the recovery program and with better muscular and neuro-cognitive feedback during the interactive therapeutic modules. © 2013 Interactive Media Institute and IOS Press.",doi,10.3233/978-1-61499-282-0-48,Scopus,Studies in Health Technology and Informatics,"Nica A.S., Brailescu C.M., Scarlet R.G.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Virtual Social Environments As A Tool For Psychological Assessment: Dynamics Of Interaction With A Virtual Spouse,"Computer games are advocated as a promising tool bridging the gap between the controllability of a lab experiment and the mundane realism of a field experiment. At the same time, many authors stress the importance of observing real behavior instead of asking participants about possible or intended behaviors. In this article, the authors introduce an online virtual social environment, which is inhabited by autonomous agents including the virtual spouse of the participant. Participants can freely explore the virtual world and interact with any other inhabitant, allowing the expression of spontaneous and unprompted behavior. The authors investigated the usefulness of this game for the assessment of interactions with a virtual spouse and their relations to intimacy and autonomy motivation as well as relationship satisfaction with the real-life partner. Both the intimacy motive and the satisfaction with the real-world relationship showed significant correlations with aggregated in-game behavior, which shows that some sort of transference between the real world and the virtual world took place. In addition, a process analysis of interaction quality revealed that relationship satisfaction and intimacy motive had different effects on the initial status and the time course of the interaction quality. Implications for psychological assessment using virtual social environments are discussed. © 2011 American Psychological Association.",doi,10.1037/a0021049,Scopus,Psychological Assessment,"Schönbrodt F.D., Asendorpf J.B.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia

,Voice Quality Conversion Using Interactive Evolution Of Prosodic Control,"Recent years have seen the birth of new markets using voice quality conversion technology for a variety of application fields including man-personal machine interfaces, addition of narration in multimedia-content editing, and computer games. Optimal parameters for voice quality conversion, however, are speaker dependent, and consequently, no clear-cut algorithm has existed in the past and parameter adjustment has usually been performed by an experienced designer on a trial and error basis. This paper proposes the application of evolutionary computation, a stochastic search technique based on organic evolution, to parameter adjustment for voice conversion, and reports on several experimental results applicable to the fitting of prosodic coefficients. Evolutionary computation is said to be ""applicable to even cases where the properties of the target function are not well known,"" and we decided to apply it considering that this feature might be effective in our study. Providing an explicit evaluative function for evolutionary computation, however, is difficult, and we here adopt an interactive-evolution system in which genetic manipulation is performed repeatedly while evaluating results based on human emotions. Evaluation experiments were performed on raw human speech recorded by a microphone and speech mechanically synthesized from text. It was found that the application of evolutionary computation could achieve voice conversion satisfying specific targets with relatively little degradation of sound quality and no impression of artificial processing in comparison to parameter adjustment based on designer experience or trial and error. This paper also shows that prosodic conversion coefficients determined by the interactive evolution technique, while exhibiting speaker dependency, is not text dependent. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

,What We Can Learn About Digital Badges From Video Games,"This chapter discusses the use of achievements within commercial video game design and development. It also summarizes research designed around specialized learning games designed to test the effectiveness of badges on learner variables such as performance and motivation. To connect game achievements to digital badges in other educational scenarios, both psychological and design factors are considered. First, connections between games research and learner motivation are discussed, especially in regards to autonomy, mastery, and purpose. Implications for measurement and assessment are considered and strategies for evaluation from prior games researchers are reviewed. Next, an overview of achievement systems within popular game environments is provided. The second half of the chapter considers best practices for designing badges as proposed by game achievement researchers. One game, Fallout Shelter, is discussed in detail in regards to its use of effective achievement design. Educational badge designers who may be working in game-based systems or other interactive learning spaces can use this information to build better badging systems in other realms of learning. The chapter also shares some caveats gleaned from the use of achievements in video games. These cautionary notes about achievements taken too far, or achievements that overpower other features of learning spaces, are useful to consider for using digital badges effectively in educational environments. The chapter concludes by proposing directions for future research exploring the connections between video game achievements and digital badges. © 2016 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",doi,10.1007/978-3-319-15425-1_18,Scopus,Foundation of Digital Badges and Micro-Credentials: Demonstrating and Recognizing Knowledge and Competencies,McDaniel R.,2016,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,When You Don't Quite Get What You Want: Psychological And Interpersonal Consequences Of Claiming Inclusion,"People's success or failure to gain inclusion in groups may result from their own actions or the actions of others. Two studies compared the personal and interpersonal consequences of inclusion and exclusion when they resulted from these two processes. People's own failure to ""claim"" inclusion in a computerized ballgame was equally detrimental for fundamental needs and made people equally unlikely to behave prosocially to group members, as being denied inclusion by others. In contrast, the beneficial effects of inclusion depended on the process with which it was obtained, and meta-perceptions of warmth mediated these differences; people who succeeded to claim inclusion thought their interaction partners liked them less than people who were granted inclusion, and as a result, their fundamental needs were satisfied less, and they behaved less prosocially. © 2012 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.",doi,10.1177/0146167212450463,Scopus,Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin,"de Waal-Andrews W., van Beest I.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Whether To Measure Change From Baseline Or Absolute Level In Studies Of Children's Cardiovascular Reactivity: A Two-Year Follow-Up,"Blood pressure and heart rate were measured at rest and during a television video game in 399 healthy children. At the first assessment, children were in third grade and at the 2-year follow-up, they were in fifth grade. Children were classified according to race (black/white), gender (boy/girl), body mass index (light/heavy), and video game performance (low score/high score). Correlational analysis indicated that irrespective of the classification variable, absolute reactivity values, e.g., a heart rate of 110 bpm, tended to be more stable than change reactivity values, e.g., a heart rate change of 10 bpm. The greater stability of absolute values was most pronounced with systolic blood pressure. Absolute values were at least as stable as resting values and frequently demonstrated greater stability. Mean and maximal reactivities were correlated comparably. We conclude that children's reactivity is a stable characteristic and that, unless indicated by a priori hypotheses, the use of absolute values is preferable to the use of change values. © 1991 Plenum Publishing Corporation.",doi,10.1007/BF00845116,Scopus,Journal of Behavioral Medicine,"Murphy J.K., Alpert B.S., Walker S.S.",1991,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Wide-Range Robust Control Of Combustion Instability,"This paper presents the concept and design of a two-layer robust control system for suppression of combustion instabilities over a wide range of operation. The control law is synthesized based on a multiple-time-scale model of combustion dynamics. Control actions on the fast-time scale are provided by secondary fuel injection, and are gain-scheduled according to the variations of mean-flow temperature and velocity on the slow-time scale. A linear parameter varying (LPV) L2-gain control law is formulated in the setting of differential game theory. Simulation experiments have been conducted to evaluate the control law under wide-range operation of a generic combustor in terms of the trade-off among: (1) fuel injection rate and pressure oscillation; (2) transient and steady responses; and (3) stability robustness and performance. © 2002 The Combustion Institute.",doi,10.1016/S0010-2180(01)00349-2,Scopus,Combustion and Flame,"Hong B.-S., Ray A., Yang V.",2002,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,"Winning Isn’t Everything: Mood And Testosterone Regulate The Cortisol Response In Competition. Plos One, 8(1).","Dominance contests are recurrent and widespread causes of stress among mammals. Studies of activation of the stress axis in social defeat – as reflected in levels of adrenal glucocorticoid, cortisol – have generated scattered and sometimes contradictory results, suggesting that biopsychological individual differences might play an important mediating role, at least in humans. In the context of a larger study of the regulation of endocrine responses to competition, we evaluated the notion that mood states, such as self-assurance and hostility, may influence cortisol reactivity to dominance cues via an interplay with baseline testosterone, considered as a potential marker of individual differences in dominance. Seventy healthy male university students (mean age 20.02, range 18–26) provided saliva samples before and after competing for fifteen minutes on a rigged computer task. After a winner was determined, all participants were assessed on their mood states through a standardized psychometric instrument (PANAS-X). Among winners of a rigged videogame competition, we found a significant interaction between testosterone and self-assurance in relation to post-competition cortisol. Specifically, self-assurance was associated with lower post-competition cortisol in subjects with high baseline testosterone levels, but no such relationship was observed in subjects with lower baseline testosterone levels. In losers of the competition no interaction effect between basal testosterone and hostility was observed. However, in this subgroup a significant negative relationship between basal testosterone and post-competition cortisol was evident. Overall, these findings provide initial support for the novel hypothesis that biological motivational predispositions (i.e. basal testosterone) and state (i.e. mood changes) may interact in regulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation after a social contest.",doi,10.1371/journal.pone.0052582,nagy2015,PLoS ONE,"Zilioli, S., Watson, N.

,"""Treasure Hunt"" - A Cognitive-Behavioural Computer Game [""Schatzsuche""- Ein Verhaltenstherapeutisches Computerspiel]","The development of video games promoting health related behaviour is increasing. This holds not only for chronic diseases like asthma and diabetes, but also for the field of child psychotherapy. At the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry of Zürich University, the video game Treasure Hunt was developed to support psychotherapeutic treatment of children between eight and thirteen years of age. Treasure Hunt does not replace the therapist but supports treatment by offering attractive electronic work assignments. The scope of this article is an overview on health games for children and a description of Treasure Hunt. After the explanation of its therapeutic potentials, an evaluation based on questionnaires for therapists and children will be presented. 124 therapists answered a questionnaire on their impression of the game three months after download. 41 therapists were willing to participate in the further evaluation and sent questionnaires of 200 children with whom Treasure Hunt had been used. A limitation of these data is that a positive bias can not be excluded, as therapists with a positive attitude towards psychotherapeutic computer games were more likely to answer the questionnaire. 118 therapists (95.2%) considered Treasure Hunt a useful tool in child psychotherapy. 197 children (98.5%) report being satisfied with the use of the game during treatment. Treasure Hunt was predominantly used for the age group it is designed for and both, by very experienced and by young therapists.

The exposure to the aggressogenic factors produced a change of the centralized control for the autonomic control in female and male teenagers with the high level of aggression and females with the low level of aggression. Male teenagers with the low level of aggression displayed the prevalence of the centralized control. Thus, the influence of exposure of teenagers to the virtual aggressogenic environment was shown to be ambiguous depending on the level of the level of personal aggression and gender.",pmid,20469589,pubmed,Zhurnal vysshei nervnoi deiatelnosti imeni I P Pavlova,"Stepanian, L S; Grigorian, V G; Stepanian, A Iu",2010,NA,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,"[Prediction Of Goal-Directed Behavior: Attitude, Subjective Behavioral Competence And Emotions].","Ajzen's (1985) theory of planned behavior explaining and predicting goal-directed behavior is extended by an emotional component. The extended theory of planned behavior is tested experimentally. N = 64 subjects play with two video games (a speed- and a problem-oriented game) under an achievement-motivational orientation. One half of the subjects plays both games in an easy version, the other half in a difficult version. The verbal emotional reactions to playing video games are grouped factor-analytically into an ""activity emotion"" and a ""security emotion"". Subjects playing video games in the difficult condition feel significantly more insecure, and perceive their behavioral control as significantly lower than subjects playing in the easy condition. Tests of the extended theory of planned behavior lead to significant squared multiple correlations for the dependent variables within the range of R2 = .20 to .58. The activity emotion accounts predominantly for a significant part of the variance of the attitude and the security emotion accounts for a significant part of the variance of the perceived behavioral control. No predictive power was found for the intention to play the games successfully.",pmid,1785209,pubmed,Zeitschrift fur experimentelle und angewandte Psychologie,"Doll, J; Mentz, M; Orth, B",1992,NA,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,A Tyrosine Hydroxylase Microsatellite And Hemodynamic Response To Stress In A Multi-Ethnic Sample Of Youth,"Objective: Behavioral stress is believed to have an impact on cardiovascular health. As the rate-limiting enzyme in the pathway for catecholamine synthesis, tyrosine hydroxylase is a candidate gene for variability in cardiovascular function. The aim of this study was to determine whether a relationship exists between a tyrosine hydroxylase microsatellite and resting hemodynamic function, and/or hemodynamic responsivity to laboratory stress. Design: Subjects underwent 2 laboratory stressors: a video game challenge and a social competence interview. Setting: The stressors were administered in a laboratory setting. Participants: Subjects were 292 10- to 20-year-old normotensive African-American and European-American twin pairs. Main Outcome Measures: Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were measured at rest and in response to the stressors. Results: Chi-square analyses using re-sampling to account for the twin design indicated that allele and genotype frequencies were significantly different between European Americans and African Americans (P≤.0001). Analyses of variance indicated that the 184 and 199 bp alleles were associated with an attenuation of the hemodynamic response to stress with increasing age (P≤.003, P≤.002, respectively), while the 188 bp allele was associated with a higher resting systolic blood pressure (SBP) (P≤.02), and greater hemodynamic response to stress with increasing BMI (P≤.02). Conclusions: This study showed that in a multi-ethnic sample of normotensive adolescents, specific alleles of this tyrosine hydroxylase microsatellite were associated with protective or deleterious cardiovascular effects with subjects at rest and responding to stress.",pmid,12785414,Scopus,Ethnicity and Disease,"Barbeau P., Litaker M.S., Jackson R.W., Treiber F.A.",2003,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Analysis Of The Work Rates And Heart Rates Of Association Football Referees,"This study aimed to describe the work-rate profiles of referees during soccer matches and record heart-rate responses during these games. Using video-recordings 14 referees were observed and their heart rates during the games were monitored by short-range radio telemetry. These included 11 football league matches. The exercise intensity was largely submaximal with a change in activity every 6s. The mean distance covered during the game was 9.44km; a significant fall in work rate was noted in the second half (P &lt; 0.05). The mean heart rate of 165 beats min-1 did not vary between first and second halves. The work rate and heart rate varied more between individuals than with the importance of the match, but this variation was small. It was considered that refereeing top level soccer places high physiological demands on the official. This has implications for training and fitness assessment. © 1993.",pmid,8242278,Scopus,British Journal of Sports Medicine,"Catterall C., Reilly T., Atkinson G., Coldwells A.",1993,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia

,Central Adiposity And Hemodynamic Functioning At Rest And During Stress In Adolescents,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the impact of central adiposity upon hemodynamic functioning at rest and during stress in adolescents. DESIGN: Cross-sectional, correlational study. SUBJECTS: 46 White and 49 Black normotensive adolescents with family histories of essential hypertension. MEASUREMENTS: Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), cardiac output and total peripheral resistance responses were assessed at rest, during postural change, video game challenge and forehead cold stimulation. Specific lower and higher waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) tertiles were created for each gender and then integrated for analyses. This resulted in a lower WHR tertile of 11 Whites and 21 Blacks and an upper WHR tertile of 15 Whites and 17 Blacks. RESULTS: No differences in age, gender or ethnicity proportions were found between tertile groups (all P > 0.21). The upper WHR group showed greater body weight, waist and hip circumferences, body mass index (BMI), triceps skinfold and body surface area (all P < 0.001). Controlling for peripheral (that is, triceps skinfold) and overall (that is, BMI) adiposity, the upper WHR group exhibited greater SBP (that is, peak response minus mean pre-stresser level) to all three stressors and greater DBP reactivity to postural change and cold presser (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Central adiposity appears to adversely influence hemodynamic functioning during adolescence.

,Development Of Computer Games For Assessment And Training In Post-Stroke Arm Telerehabilitation.,"Stroke is the leading cause of long term disability among adults in industrialized nations. The majority of these disabilities include deficiencies in arm function, which can make independent living very difficult. Research shows that better results in rehabilitation are obtained when patients receive more intensive therapy. However this intensive therapy is currently too expensive to be provided by the public health system, and at home few patients perform the repetitive exercises recommended by their therapists. Computer games can provide an affordable, enjoyable, and effective way to intensify treatment, while keeping the patient as well as their therapists informed about their progress.

,Diminished Pulse Pressure Under Mental Stress Characterizes Normotensive Adolescents With Parental High Blood Pressure.,"An exaggerated blood pressure response to mental stress is believed to characterize young adults with genetic risk of essential hypertension, suggesting that stress-induced changes might provide a useful index of pathogenetic processes. We explored this by studying pressor responsivity to competitive tasks in adolescents drawn from a large urban population. Individuals with systolic or diastolic pressures persistently between the 85th and 95th percentiles were evaluated on basal blood pressure, parental history of hypertension, and pressor and heart rate response to a challenging video game. Basal pressure was measured again at 6, 10, and 14 months. A persistently diminished pulse pressure was the cardiovascular characteristic that most reliably typified normotensive subjects with familial hypertension. Response to the video game was the best indicator of risk status. Contrary to expectations derived from research with convenience samples, epidemiologic investigation points to an increased peripheral resistance and lower cardiac output as the cardiovascular pattern more prominently associated with genetic risk in the normotensive adolescent.",pmid,3763788,pubmed,Psychosomatic medicine,"Ewart, C K; Harris, W L; Zeger, S; Russell, G A",1986,NA,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Effect Of Interactive Metronome® Training On Children With Adhd,"Objective. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of a specific intervention, the Interactive Metronome®, on selected aspects of motor and cognitive skills in a group of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Method. The study included 56 boys who were 6 years to 12 years of age and diagnosed before they entered the study as having ADHD. The participants were pretested and randomly assigned to one of three matched groups. A group of 19 participants receiving 15 hr of Interactive Metronome training exercises were compared with a group receiving no intervention and a group receiving training on selected computer video games. Results. A significant pattern of improvement across 53 of 58 variables favoring the Interactive Metronome treatment was found. Additionally, several significant differences were found among the treatment groups and between pretreatment andposttreatment factors on performance in areas of attention, motor control, language processing, reading, and parental reports of improvements in regulation of aggressive behavior.

,Emotlab: Software For Studying Emotional Signaling In Economic Bargaining Games,"EMOTLAB software creates a virtual social environment in which individuals interact via computer with a virtual interaction partner in a series of economic bargaining games. The virtual partner appears on the participant's computer screen as a digital image (e.g., video or picture file) during each trial. A key feature of EMOTLAB software is its ability to control both the strategic behavior and the emotion signaling behavior (e.g., anger vs. embarrassment) of the virtual interaction partner. By simply editing a series of text files that control the subroutines governing the different features of the experiment (payoff structure, number of trials, etc.), EMOTLAB can generate an essentially infinite number of different social bargaining situations in which participants earn monetary payoffs contingent upon their decisions. This paper provides an overview of this software and how one can edit various subroutines to generate a typical experimental session in which research participants encounter a virtual interaction partner who displays different emotional signals.

,Energy Metabolism During Activity-Promoting Video Games Practice In Subjects With Spinal Cord Injury: Evidences For Health Promotion,"Background: Activity promoting video game (APVG) practice significantly affects energy metabolism through energy expenditure (EE) increase and has been recently included in strategies for health promotion. It is not known if the APVG practice provides similar outcomes in subjects with spinal cord injury (SCI). Aim: Aim of the study was to evaluate cardio-pulmonary and metabolic adaptations during APVG practice and to find whether EE increase above resting condition could suggest the inclusion of this exercise in a more general strategy for health promotion and body weight control in subjects with SCI. Design: Repeated measures study. Setting: Rehabilitation Institute. Population: Ten male subjects with SCI (lesion levels from C7 to L1) age 26 to 55 years. Methods: We recorded pulmonary ventilation (VE), oxygen consumption (VO 2) for EE esteem and heart rate (HR) at rest and while playing virtual bowling, tennis and boxing games using a portable metabolimeter equipped with ECG electrodes. The standard metabolic equivalent of task (METs) was calculated offline. The metabolic and functional parameters were referred to the 10th minute of each activity. Results: Metabolic and functional parameters increased significantly from rest to bowling, tennis and boxing. METs exceeded in average 3 during boxing. One hour of APVG can increase daily EE by about 6% (bowling), 10% (tennis) and 15% (boxing). Conclusion: These considerable results suggest that physical exertion during APVG practice in subjects with SCI could contribute to health promotion as well as caloric balance control, especially when boxing is considered. This can be safely achieved at home with regular activity. Clinical rehabilitation impact: These findings substantiate the potential for novel exercise modalities to counteract deconditioning due to inactivity in subjects with SCI by promoting physical activity through implementation of APVG exercise programs.",pmid,23370043,Scopus,European Journal of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine,"Gaffurini P., Bissolotti L., Calza S., Calabretto C., Orizio C., Gobbo M.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,"Immediate And Long-Term Effects Of Meditation On Acute Stress Reactivity, Cognitive Functions, And Intelligence","Context With the current globalization of the world's economy and demands for enhanced performance, stress is present universally. Life's stressful events and daily stresses cause both deleterious and cumulative effects on the human body. The practice of meditation might offer a way to relieve that stress. Objective The research team intended to study the effects of meditation on stress-induced changes in physiological parameters, cognitive functions, intelligence, and emotional quotients. Methods The research team conducted the study in two phases, with a month between them. Each participant served as his own control, and the first phase served as the control for the second phase. In phase 1, the research team studied the effects of a stressor (10 minutes playing a computer game) on participants' stress levels. In phase 2, the research team examined the effects of meditation on stress levels. Setting The research team conducted the study in a lab setting at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India. Participants The participants were 34 healthy, male volunteers who were students. Intervention To study the effects of long-term meditation on stress levels, intelligence, emotional quotients, and cognitive functions participants meditated daily for 1 month, between phases 1 and 2. To study the immediate effects of meditation on stress levels, participants meditated for 15 minutes after playing a computer game to induce stress. Outcome Measures The research team measured galvanic skin response (GSR), heart rate (HR), and salivary cortisol and administered tests for the intelligence and emotional quotients (IQ and EQ), acute and perceived stress (AS and PS), and cognitive functions (ie, the Sternberg memory test [short-term memory] and the Stroop test [cognitive flexibility]). Using a pre-post study design, the team performed this testing (1) prior to the start of the study (baseline); (2) in phase 1, after induced stress; (3) in part 1 of phase 2, after 1 month of daily meditation, and (4) in part 2 of phase 2, after induced stress, both before and after 15 minutes of meditation. Results Induced stress from the computer game resulted in a significant increase in physiological markers of stress such as GSR and HR. In the short term, meditation was associated with a physiological relaxation response (significant decrease in GSR) and an improvement in scores on the Stroop test of reaction times. In the long term, meditation brought significant improvements in IQ and scores for cognitive functions, whereas participants' stress levels (GSR and AS) decreased. EQ, salivary cortisol, and HR showed no significant changes. Conclusions The practice of meditation reduced psychological stress responses and improved cognitive functions, and the effects were pronounced with practice of meditation for a longer duration (1 month).",pmid,23251943,Scopus,Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine,"Singh Y., Sharma R., Talwar A.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Impact Of A Serious Game For Health On Chronic Disease Self-Management: Preliminary Efficacy Among Community Dwelling Adults With Hypertension,"Most Americans will acquire a chronic disease during their lifetime. One of the most prevalent chronic diseases that affect Americans is hypertension (HTN). Despite the known comorbidities and increased mortality rate associated with uncontrolled HTN, most community dwelling adults with HTN do not have sufficient blood pressure control. Therefore, the aim of this article is to report the preliminary efficacy of a serious game for health to enhance blood pressure control among community dwelling adults with HTN. A nonprobability sample of 116 community dwelling adults with HTN participated in this nonblinded, randomized controlled trial. Participants were randomly assigned to: (1) an intervention arm that consisted of four exposures to a serious game for health known as eSMART-HD; or (2) an attentional control arm that compromised of four exposures to screen-based HTN education. The primary outcome measure for this trial was blood pressure reduction over a four month observational period. In this study, baseline characteristics and blood pressure measurements were similar between participants in each study arm. There was no significant between-group difference in blood pressure reduction over time. However, there were significant within-group reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressures across time among favoring participants exposed to eSMART-HD. This study establishes the preliminary efficacy of eSMART-HD that can be easily administered to community dwelling adults and facilitate clinically significant reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Future studies should assess the influential components of this promising serious game for health (eSMART-HD) combined with medication management in larger and more diverse samples of community dwelling adults with HTN. © 2015, Southern Public Administration Education Foundation, Inc.

,Inverse Relationship Of Urinary Cyclic Gmp To Blood Pressure Reactivity In The Cardia Study: Vasodilatory Regulation Of Sympathetic Vasoconstriction,"Objective: To determine whether urinary cyclic GMP (cGMP), which mediates the actions of the vasodilators nitric oxide and atrial natriuretic factor, is inversely related to blood pressure (BP) reactivity. In previous work, we found that urinary cGMP was inversely related to diastolic BP, but cGMP levels were higher among individuals presumed to have increased adrenergic activity, increased reactivity, and increased risk of hypertension (blacks, individuals with a family history of hypertension). Method: We measured 24-hour urinary cGMP levels in a substudy of 529 individuals in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study; the sample was 23 to 35 years of age and approximately balanced for race (black/white) and gender. BP reactivity to stressors (video game, star-tracing, cold pressor) was tested 3 years earlier. Baseline BP was included as a covariate in all analyses. Results: Diastolic BP reactivity to cold pressor was inversely related to cGMP excretion (p < .05); the relationship was strongest among black women with a family history of hypertension (partial r = -.33, p < .01). Systolic BP reactivity to star-tracing was also inversely related to cGMP (p < .01); the relationship for both star-tracing and video game stressors was strongest among black men (partial r values = -.25 and -.24, respectively; p values < .01). Conclusions: The results indicate that vasodilatory activity may impact the BP response to stress through modulation of adrenergic activation, particularly among blacks.",pmid,9625219,Scopus,Psychosomatic Medicine,"Markovitz J.H., Tucker D., Lewis C.E., Sanders P.W., Warnock D.G.",1998,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Kinetic And Physiological Analysis Of The Gamewheels System,"For individuals with a spinal cord injury or dysfunction (SCI/D), opportunities to exercise are limited and are usually not highly motivating experiences. Exercise programs or extracurricular activities may help increase or maintain the cardiovascular fitness level of individuals with SCI/D. The GAMEWheels system, an interface between a portable roller system and a computer, enables an individual to control a video game by propelling his or her wheelchair. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the propulsive forces used during video play, both with and without the GAMEWheels system, were different. A secondary purpose was to examine differences in metabolic parameters during exercise under these two conditions. Ten manual wheelchair users exercised on the GAMEWheels system with and without controlling a video game. Physiological and kinetic data were collected six times during two exercise trials. Kinetic data were recorded with the SMARTWheel and used to investigate propulsion forces. No significant differences were found in the resultant force, rate of rise, or number of hand contacts with the pushrims. This study showed that propulsion pattern did not change significantly when wheelchair users exercised while playing a computer video game. Oxygen consumption, ventilation, and heart rate were significantly different (p &lt; 0.05) between the two groups during the last three exercise intervals and cooldown. Playing a video game while exercising may help to motivate manual wheelchair users to exercise longer and regularly, something that was reported by this study's subjects; likewise, exercising while playing a video game may not be associated with higher pushrim forces and stroke frequencies.",pmid,17943665,Scopus,Journal of Rehabilitation Research and Development,"O'Connor T.J., Fitzgerald S.G., Cooper R.A., Thorman T.A., Boninger M.L.",2002,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia

,Modeling Emotion And Behavior In Animated Personas To Facilitate Human Behavior Change: The Case Of The Heart-Sense Game,"The goal of this research is to determine whether a computer based training game (HEART-SENSE) can improve recognition of heart attack symptoms and shift behavioral issues so as to reduce pre-hospitalization delay in seeking treatment. Since treatment delay correlates with adverse outcomes, this research could reduce myocardial infarction mortality and morbidity. In Phase I we created and evaluated a prototype virtual village in which users encounter and help convince synthetic personas to deal appropriately with a variety of heart attack scenarios and delay issues. Innovations made here are: (1) a design for a generic simulator package for promoting health behavior shifts, and (2) algorithms for animated pedagogical agents to reason about how their emotional state ties to patient condition and user progress. Initial results show that users of the game exhibit a significant shift in intention to call 9-1-1 and avoid delay, that multi-media versions of the game foster vividness and memory retention as well as a better understanding of both symptoms and of the need to manage time during a heart attack event. Also, results provide insight into areas where emotive pedagogical agents help and hinder user performance. Finally, we conclude with next steps that will help improve the game and the field of pedagogical agents and tools for simulated worlds for healthcare education and promotion. © 2001 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",pmid,11519847,Scopus,Health Care Management Science,"Silverman B.G., Holmes J., Kimmel S., Branas C., Ivins D., Weaver R., Chen Y.I.",2001,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Multidimensional Performance Characteristics In Talented Male Youth Volleyball Players,"The purpose of this study was to determine whether anthropometric, physical, psychological, and skill test results could be used to discriminate between male junior volleyball players of varying ability. A total of 66 elite and nonelite male Estonian volleyball players aged 16-17 years were measured for anthropometric and physical variables and sport-specific skills. In addition, the players' provided self-reports of dispositional achievement goals, perceived sport competence and enjoyment and their game intelligence was measured. Selected youth players scored better than nonselected youth players on physical (explosive strength), technical (passing and spiking), and cognitive (game intelligence) characteristics and reported higher mastery-approach goals, perceived sport competence and enjoyment of sport. The most discriminating variables were game intelligence, mastery approach goals, perceived sport competence and passing technique. These results suggest the important role of multidimensional performance measures in selecting and developing young male volleyball players. Structured talent identification and development programs have been developed for several sports, in particular athletics, rowing, gymnastics, field hockey and soccer, where success has been related to anthropometric, physiological and motor skill attributes (3,25,34,46). According to Williams and Reilly (50), research should adopt a multidisciplinary approach to talent identification. Recently, Vaeyens et al. (46) suggested that when researchers will concentrate on a combination of anthropometric, physical, and physiological measures, their predictive value has proven problematic in the majority of team sports. For example, Gabbett and coworkers demonstrated that subjective coach evaluation of passing and serving technique, but not physiological and anthropometric data, discriminate between successful and unsuccessful talent-identified junior volleyball players (20). In addition, an increasing number of researchers have argued that potentially important psychological variables are often overlooked within talent identifcation models (1,34,46). Research suggests that successful elite athletes posses a range of psychological characteristics including the ability to cope with anxiety and obstacles, selfconfdence, competitiveness, intrinsic motivation, and the ability to set and achieve goals (22,40). Termed ""Psychological Characteristics of Developing Excellence"", or PCDEs, these factors allowed aspiring elites to optimize development opportunities, adapt to setbacks and effectively negotiate key transitions encountered along the pathway to excellence (29). However, relatively little scientific evidence has been accumulated thus far as to which skills are required at different stages, for different activities, or even idiosyncratically for different individuals. Motivation is a construct that underpins much of the literature on personal characteristics of talent identification and numerous authors have attested to its important role in the development of sport expertise (1,12,13,34). According to achievement goal theory, it is assumed that people judge their competence and define successful accomplishment via at last two different goal perspectives-task and ego goals (32). People who are strongly task oriented tend to demonstrate their competence in a self-referenced manner and focus on realizing personal improvement, task-mastery and learning. Individuals who have a strong ego orientation have a tendency to want to demonstrate high competence relative to other people (38). Recently, the valence dimension of competence has been integrated into the achievement goal literature to create a 2 × 2 achievement goal framework (15). The 2 × 2 achievement goal framework comprises four distinct achievement goals: mastery-approach, mastery-avoidance, performance-approach, and performance-avoidance. In the limited studies that have been done in sport contexts, mastery-approach goals have been found to be positively linked to the belief that sport competence can be developed ant competence valuation, and negatively related to state anxiety and motivation (7,9). Performance-approach goals have been found to correlate positively with the belief that one' s level of sport competence is fixed, perceptions of performance climate, and competence valuation and negatively link to state anxiety. Performance-avoidance and mastery-avoidance tend to correlate with a network of negative achievementrelated processes and outcomes, including state anxiety and amotivation (7,9). Further, perceived competence is considered to be a primary antecedent of goal adoption. High perceived competence is posited to orient individuals to the possibility of success, and to facilitate the adoption of approach goals. In contrast, low perceived competence is supposed to orient individuals to the possibility of failure to facilitate the adoption of avoidance goals (15). Enjoyment has been recognized as a key factor for motivated behavior and sustained involvement in youth sport (40,41,48). Enjoyment as ""a positive affective response to the sport experience that reflects generalized feelings such as pleasure, liking and fun"" (41, p. 6) is the theoretical defnition used in this study (10). Enjoyment is also a component of achievement goal theory (32) and an important outcome in its own right as young athletes who enjoy participating in their sport have more meaningful sport experience and more likely to continue participation (48). To solve a problem effectively in a sport-challenging context, the performer has to perceive the environment, anticipate the on-going activity, make a decision, and respond as quickly and as accurately as he or she is capable of doing (42). Game intelligence in team sports refects a player's ability to use cognitive processes (ability to read the game, having strong tactical awareness) during games when they have to execute a game plan against the other team (18). Therefore, by applying a multidimensional design of talent identifcation in ball games such as volleyball, the cognitive ability to solve tactical problems should be assessed in addition to motor, motivational and technical variables (18,42). The purpose of this study was to determine whether anthropometric, physical, psychological, and skill test results could be used to discriminate between male junior volleyball players of varying ability. Based on previous research (19,20,28), we expected that volleyball skills and explosive strength but not anthropometric characteristics would discriminate between junior volleyball players of different levels. With regard to psychological variables, we anticipated that youth national team players exhibited higher levels of game intelligence, mastery-and performance approach goals, perceived sport competence and enjoyment when compared with nonselected players. Method: Participants: Sixty-five junior volleyball players (mean age, 16.7 ± 0.7 years) participated in this study. An initial invitation to participate in the current study was sent to coaches of 5 volleyball clubs located in Tallinn and Tartu (Estonia). All five clubs agreed to participate and all male volleyball players aged 16-17 years were invited to participate. Participants were assigned into two groups according to playing level: selected-players on the U16 and U18 national youth team; and nonselected-players on regional teams. Measures: Anthropometric and Physical Characteristics: Anthropometry included the recording of stature, body mass and standing reach stature. Stature was measured using a Martin metal anthropometer (A&D Instruments Ltd, UK) to the nearest 0.1 cm and body mass was measured using calibrated digital scales to the nearest 0.1 kg. Standing reach stature was measured using a metal anthropometer. Players were requested to stand with feet flat on the ground, extend their arm and hand, and mark the standing reach stature. Upper-body muscular strength and endurance was evaluated using the 30-s sit-ups test from the EUROFIT test battery (17). The agility of players was evaluated using the Illinois agility run (39) and explosive power was measured using vertical jump test. Participants performed the jumping test on the mobile contact timing mat system (Newtest OY, Finland). Players were instructed to execute all vertical jumps with their hands on the hips to diminish upper body movement and standardize the movement pattern. The highest value obtained from three attempts was used. Volleyball Skills: Each player performed four volleyball skills (spiking, passing, setting and serving) in an indoor stadium. After a standardized warm-up players performed six attempts of each skill. Two video cameras (Sony, HDR-XR520VE), positioned approximately 5 m from the player, were used to film each skill. For spiking and setting skills, players were filmed from the side and front of the player. Players' accuracy was based on the ability to hit specific targets. The players' technique was subjectively evaluated from video footage by two expert coaches using standardized technical protocols (20). Psychological Testing: Dispositional achievement goals in sport were measured via the 12-item Achievement Goals Questionnaire for Sport (AGQ-S; 6). The AGQ-S was designed to tap athletes' ways to strive for demonstrating high competence or avoid demonstrating incompetence in the athletic domain. Study participants responded on a scale ranging from 1=""not at all like me"" to 7=""completely like me"".",pmid,22109779,Scopus,Pediatric Exercise Science,"Rikberg A., Raudsepp L.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,"Neuroscience, Virtual Reality And Neurorehabilitation: Brain Repair As A Validation Of Brain Theory.","This paper argues that basing cybertherapy approaches on a theoretical understanding of the brain has advantages. On one hand it provides for a rational approach towards therapy design while on the other allowing for a direct validation of brain theory in the clinic. As an example this paper discusses how the Distributed Adaptive Control architecture, a theory of mind, brain and action, has given rise to a new paradigm in neurorehabilitation called the Rehabilitation Gaming System (RGS) and to novel neuroprosthetic systems. The neuroprosthetic system considered is developed to replace the function of cerebellar micro-circuits, expresses core aspects of the learning systems of DAC and has been successfully tested in in-vivo experiments. The Virtual reality based rehabilitation paradigm of RGS has been validated in the treatment of acute and chronic stroke and has been shown to be more effective than existing methods. RGS provides a foundation for integrated at-home therapy systems that can operate largely autonomously when also augmented with appropriate physiological monitoring and diagnostic devices. These examples provide first steps towards a science based medicine.",pmid,22254789,Scopus,Conference proceedings : ...

,Physiological And Perceptual Responses To Nintendo® Wii Fit™ In Young And Older Adults.,"Physically active video gaming (AVG) provides a technologically-modern, convenient means of increasing physical activity (PA). This study examined cardiovascular, metabolic, and perceptual responses in young adult (AP) and older adult (OP) participants engaging in Wii FitTM AVG play, and compared PA levels during play to recommended PA levels. Heart rate (HR), percent heart rate reserve (%HRR), oxygen consumption (VO2), energy expenditure (EE), rating of perceived exertion (RPE), enjoyment level (EL), and step count data were obtained from 10 YP and 10 OP during 15 minutes of rest and four 15-minute bouts of Wii FitTM activities (yoga, balance, aerobics, strength). For all participants, AVG significantly increased HR, VO2, and EE measures above rest, with significant between-activity differences. Responses were similar between YP and OP, except that the activities were more intense for OP, in terms of %HRR and RPE. Most games elicited responses consistent with light-intensity PA, though peak HR and VO2 values for aerobic and strength games met or approached recommended PA intensities. Wii FitTM appears to provide an enjoyable form of light PA for both YP and OP, which can reduce inactive screen time and provide beneficial cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and metabolic stimulation.",pmid,27182377,pubmed,International journal of exercise science,"Mullins, Nicole M; Tessmer, Kathryn A; McCarroll, Michele L; Peppel, Brian P",2017,NA,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Physiology Of Soccer: An Update.,"Soccer is the most popular sport in the world and is performed by men and women, children and adults with different levels of expertise. Soccer performance depends upon a myriad of factors such as technical/biomechanical, tactical, mental and physiological areas. One of the reasons that soccer is so popular worldwide is that players may not need to have an extraordinary capacity within any of these performance areas, but possess a reasonable level within all areas. However, there are trends towards more systematic training and selection influencing the anthropometric profiles of players who compete at the highest level. As with other activities, soccer is not a science, but science may help improve performance. Efforts to improve soccer performance often focus on technique and tactics at the expense of physical fitness. During a 90-minute game, elite-level players run about 10 km at an average intensity close to the anaerobic threshold (80-90% of maximal heart rate). Within this endurance context, numerous explosive bursts of activity are required, including jumping, kicking, tackling, turning, sprinting, changing pace, and sustaining forceful contractions to maintain balance and control of the ball against defensive pressure. The best teams continue to increase their physical capacities, whilst the less well ranked have similar values as reported 30 years ago. Whether this is a result of fewer assessments and training resources, selling the best players, and/or knowledge of how to perform effective exercise training regimens in less well ranked teams, is not known. As there do exist teams from lower divisions with as high aerobic capacity as professional teams, the latter factor probably plays an important role. This article provides an update on the physiology of soccer players and referees, and relevant physiological tests. It also gives examples of effective strength- and endurance-training programmes to improve on-field performance. The cited literature has been accumulated by computer searching of relevant databases and a review of the authors' extensive files. From a total of 9893 papers covering topics discussed in this article, 843 were selected for closer scrutiny, excluding studies where information was redundant, insufficient or the experimental design was inadequate. In this article, 181 were selected and discussed. The information may have important implications for the safety and success of soccer players and hopefully it should be understood and acted upon by coaches and individual soccer players.",pmid,15974635,pubmed,"Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)","Stølen, Tomas; Chamari, Karim; Castagna, Carlo; Wisløff, Ulrik",2005,NA,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Predictors Of Differences Between Type A And B Individuals In Heart Rate And Blood Pressure Reactivity,"Past estimates of the magnitude of Type A-B differences in cardiovascular reactivity are probably overly conservative. In addition, it is unclear which situations are more likely to elicit excessive reactivity in Type As. The present meta-analysis found that, overall, Type As had greater heart rate (mean d =.22), diastolic blood pressure (d =.22), and especially systolic blood pressure responses (d =.33) than Type Bs; these effect sizes were small but relatively consistent. However, Type As showed especially greater cardiovascular reactivity in situations characterized as having (a) positive or negative feedback evaluation, (b) socially aversive elements such as verbal harassment or criticism, and (c) elements inherent in playing video games. Measures of time urgency, Type A assessment method, and gender were not found to be strongly related to A-B differences in cardiovascular reactivity. Future studies that use more ""Type A-relevant"" situations will probably find greater effects.",pmid,8416033,Scopus,Psychological Bulletin,Lyness S.A.,1993,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Pressor Reactivity In American Samoan Children: Comparisons With Mainland American Children.,"In this investigation, 70 children from American Samoa participated in a standardized assessment of blood pressure and heart rate reactivity during a television video game. Data from Samoan children were compared with previously collected data from children (both black and white) residing in the continental United States. Samoan and black children demonstrated similar blood pressure reactivity (both absolute and delta values; P > .05); Samoans and blacks demonstrated greater blood pressure reactivity than whites (P < .05). Ethnic differences in heart rate reactivity were not as pronounced. After we adjusted reactivity values for ethnic differences in age, Quetelet index, and resting measurements, Samoans' reactivity continued to be more similar to the reactivity of blacks than that of whites. Results provide further evidence of ethnic differences in children's pressor reactivity; these differences may be related to differences in hypertension in adulthood.",pmid,7742732,Scopus,Ethnicity & disease,"Murphy J.K., McGarvey S.T.",1994,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Psychological Stress And Arterial Pulse Transit Time.,"Progress in isolating the psychological factors contributing to the development of arterial hypertension has been retarded by the absence of suitable, non-invasive and continuous measures of significant aspects of cardiovascular activity. Pulse transit time may help to resolve this problem since it reflects changes in arterial elasticity and diastolic blood pressure. A method of recording pulse transit time is described. Significant decreases in pulse transit time were observed in response to a cold pressor test, a video game, a reaction-time task and problem solving, regardless of site of measurement or method of pulse transduction.",pmid,6575313,pubmed,The New Zealand medical journal,"Dutch, J; Redman, S",1983,NA,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Rage Control: Regulate And Gain Emotional Control.,"Advances in neurobiology and computer science make possible interventions designed to strengthen basic processes behind emotional control. We present one such computer-based intervention, RAGE Control (Regulate And Gain Emotional Control). This extends the usual paradigm of biofeedback by requiring relaxation in the midst of engaging executive processes in a quick reaction task. RAGE Control teaches children to simultaneously focus, react, inhibit impulses, and keep their heart rate down in the context of a traditional space battle game. The program is grounded in the theory of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and is currently in clinical use by psychotherapists at Children's Hospital in Boston. It aims to reduce the need for psychotropic medication to help children gain emotional control.

,"Relationships Among Socioeconomic Status, Stress Induced Changes In Cortisol, And Blood Pressure In African American Males","The inverse relation between socioeconomic status (SES) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk has been posited to be partially due to exaggerated cardiovascular reactivity (CVR) to stress. Stress elicits hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation (e.g., increased cortisol secretion), which may contribute to subsequent blood pressure (BP) elevation. Univariate associations among SES, cortisol secretion, and aggregated change scores to stressors (i.e., video game and forehead cold) for systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) were assessed in a sample of 24 African American males (M age = 18.8, ± 2.7 years). Circadian variability of cortisol level was taken into account by partialling out collection time. Family SES was inversely related to initial cortisol level (partial r = -.46, p < .03). Neighborhood SES was inversely related to DBP reactivity (r = -.41, p < .05). The change in cortisol level during the stressor protocol was related to SBP reactivity (partial r = .44, p < .05). These results suggest that SES may be linked to CVD via BP and cortisol reactivity to stress, but prospective studies are needed to clarify whether such is the case.",pmid,12434943,Scopus,Annals of Behavioral Medicine,"Kapuku G.K., Treiber F.A., Davis H.C.",2002,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,"The Association Of Subjective Stress, Urinary Catecholamine Concentrations And Pc Game Room Use And Musculoskeletal Disorders Of The Upper Limbs In Young Male Koreans","The use of PCs can cause health problems, including musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) of the upper limbs. This study was performed to investigate whether using PCs in PC game rooms may induce MSDs of the upper limbs. 284 young male Koreans were included. A self-administered, structured questionnaire was used to gather information about game room use, perceived subjective stress, and the symptoms related to MSDs. Urinary concentrations of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine were measured in spot urine. The symptom prevalence of MSDs of the upper limbs increased according to the increase of the duration of game room use. The intensity of perceived subjective stress showed a significant dose-response relationship with the frequency of MSDs symptoms in neck and shoulder areas. However, the urinary level of catecholamines was not significantly correlated with the symptom prevalence of MSDs in the upper limbs. These findings suggest that using PCs in game rooms produce physical stress on the upper limbs, strong enough to induce MSDs.",pmid,12808332,Scopus,Journal of Korean Medical Science,"Kang J.-W., Kim H., Cho S.-H., Lee M.-K., Kim Y.-D., Nan H.-M., Lee C.-H.",2003,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,"The Physiological Cost And Enjoyment Of Wii Fit In Adolescents, Young Adults, And Older Adults","Background: Active video games (exergames) increase energy expenditure (EE) and physical activity (PA) compared with sedentary video gaming. The physiological cost and enjoyment of exergaming in adolescents, and young and older adults has not been documented, nor compared with aerobic exercise. This study compared the physiological cost and enjoyment of exergaming on Wii Fit with aerobic exercise in 3 populations. Methods: Cardiorespiratory and enjoyment measurements were compared in 14 adolescents, 15 young adults, and 13 older adults during handheld inactive video gaming, Wii Fit activities (yoga, muscle conditioning, balance, aerobics), and brisk treadmill walking and jogging. Results: For all groups EE and heart rate (HR) of Wii Fit activities were greater than handheld gaming (P < .001) but lower than treadmill exercise (P ≤ .001). Wii aerobics elicited moderate intensity activity in adolescents, young adults, and older adults with respective mean (SD) metabolic equivalents of 3.2 (0.7), 3.6 (0.8), and 3.2 (0.8). HR during Wii aerobics fell below the recommended intensity for maintaining cardiorespiratory fitness. Group enjoyment rating was greater for We balance and aerobics compared with treadmill walking and jogging (P ≤ .05). Conclusions: Wii Fit appears an enjoyable exergame for adolescents and adults, stimulating light-to-moderate intensity activity through the modification of typically sedentary leisure behavior. © 2010 Human Kinetics, Inc.",pmid,20551497,Scopus,Journal of Physical Activity and Health,"Graves L.E.F., Ridgers N.D., Williams K., Stratton G., Atkinson G., Cable N.T.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,"The Relationship Between Violent Video Games, Acculturation, And Aggression Among Latino Adolescents.","Multiple factors are involved in the occurrence of aggressive behavior. The purpose of this studywas to evaluate the hypotheses that Latino middle school children exposed to higher levels ofvideo game playing will exhibit a higher level of aggression and fighting compared to childrenexposed to lower levels and that the more acculturated middle school Latino children will playmore video games and will prefer more violent video games compared to less acculturatedmiddle school Latino children. This study involved 5,831 students attending eight public schoolsin Texas. A linear relationship was observed between the time spent playing video games andaggression scores. Higher aggression scores were significantly associated with heavier videoplaying for boys and girls (p<0.0001). The more students played video games, the more theyfought at school (p<0.0001). As Latino middle school students were more acculturated, theirpreference for violent video game playing increased, as well as the amount of time they playedvideo games.

,Validity Of Borg Ratings Of Perceived Exertion During Active Video Game Play.,"During physically interactive video game play (e.g., Nintendo Wii), users are exposed to potential distracters (e.g., video, music), which may decrease their ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) throughout game play. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the association between RPE scores and heart rate while playing the Nintendo Wii. Healthy adults (N = 13, 53.5 ± 5.4 years old) participated in two exercise sessions using the Nintendo Wii Fit Plus. During each session participants played a five-minute warm-up game (Basic Run), two separate Wii Fit Plus games (Yoga, Strength Training, Aerobics or Balance Training) for fifteen minutes each, and then a five-minute cool down game (Basic Run). Borg RPE and heart rate were assessed during the final 30 seconds of the warm up and cool down, as well during the final 30 seconds of play for each Wii Fit Plus game. Correlation analysis combining data from both exercise sessions indicated a moderate positive relationship between heart rate and RPE (r = 0.32). Mixed-effects model regression analyses demonstrated that RPE scores were significantly associated with heart rate (p < 0.001). The average percentage of age-predicted heart rate maximum achieved (58 ± 6%) was significantly greater (p = 0.001) than the percentage of maximum RPE indicated (43 ± 11%). Borg RPE scores were positively associated with heart rate in adults during exercise sessions using the Wii Fit Plus. However, this relationship was lower than observed in past research assessing RPE validity during different modes of exercise (e.g. walking, running) without distracters.",pmid,27293499,pubmed,International journal of exercise science,"Pollock, Brandon S; Barkley, Jacob E; Potenzini, Nick; Desalvo, Renee M; Buser, Stacey L; Otterstetter, Ronald; Juvancic-Heltzel, Judith A",2017,NA,NA,reviewer2,Lydia

,A Reactive Behavior Agent: Including Emotions Into A Video Game,"Why we have emotions and how they influence human behavior are two questions we constantly ask ourselves. According to researchers in the field, there are two kinds of information that the person receives to make a decision. This information is integrated to generate a whole. One comes from ourselves it is proprioceptive and refers to emotions; the other one is external, it comes from the environment. Thus, emotions are immersed in different areas of a person's life, including social, functional, and cognitive aspects. It has an important role in the decision-making process. It is on this last point that this paper focuses its approach, which consists of including a cognitive structure of emotions in a reactive behavior in order to enrich behavior, including the information generated through internal evaluation of the external physical stimuli. Our work is based on the OCC theory (named after the name of its authors: Ortony, Collins and Clore). This theory proposes that a decision-making process is affected through different perspectives: a) goals and events, b) agents and their actions, and c) objects and their capacity for attraction.

,A Review On Laser Spot Detection System Based On Image Processing Techniques,"Laser pointer is a low-cost daily essential item that can provide a prominent spot, deliver the meaning of a pointing gesture and accurately indicate a spot. Robust detection of a laser spot has been made possible with the help of the computer vision techniques. Autonomous laser spot detection system has led to the evolution of many applications such as laser pointer interaction, autonomous robotic helper and simulation based computer game. This paper aims to provide the general architecture and methodology used in a laser spot detection system. Major lower level processing methods, such as thresholding, background subtraction, region of interest extraction and coordinate mapping are fundamental in developing a good laser spot system. Our study found out that most of existing systems are prone to error whenever the lighting condition is varied either gradually or suddenly. The spot is also difficult to detect when it is overlaid on a white background due to the weakness in the detection scheme. Jitter, which is mostly caused by uneven hand movement, is a big challenge in developing an accurate system, especially for laser interaction applications. Finally, we believe that a robust laser spot detection system can be built if the aforementioned challenges are carefully addressed. © 2005 - 2014 JATIT & LLS.

The average age of the participants was 17.9±0.3 years, the average mass was 65.4±6.9 kg, and the average height was 169.6±6.9 cm. Time-motion analyses of the players were performed using Video Manual Motion Tracker 1.0 software. The descriptive approach of the study determined the overall physical activity (distance [m]) and type of locomotion (standing, walking, jogging, medium-intensity running, high-intensity running, sprinting). The players' heart rates were monitored using TEAM Polar2Pro sport testers (Polar Electro, Kempele, Finland). The maximum heart rate was measured by means of the Yo-Yo intermittent level 1 (YYIRT1) recovery test. One-way ANOVA with repeated- measures was used to compare data on heart rate, covered distance and speed. Based on the results from the time-motion analysis, the average distance covered was 113.3±8.6 m per minute per match. The average distance the players covered during the matches was 3399±362.3 m. The shortest distance (385.8±371.6 m), was traversed by standing and walking, and the longest distance (935.8±165.5 m) by jogging. The players' average heart rate was 183.7±7.3 beats·min-1. The mean intensity during the matches represented 89.6±3.6% of the maximal heart rate (HRmax). The results of this study demonstrate that handball is a high-intensity intermittent sport. The physiological profile shows that the players spent more than 83% of the playing time per match in the high-intensity zone (&gt;85%HRmax). Based on this, training focused on anaerobic exercises and interval training methods is recommended. Anaerobic training ensures that players will be ready to carry out a high intensity performance and to maintain it during the whole match. Maintaining high intensity depends chiefly on the ability to replenish energy systems during the period spent in lower-intensity locomotion. We recommend working on the improvements in anaerobic and aerobic power during practice sessions.",eid,2-s2.0-84903757373,Scopus,Kinesiology,"Belka J., Hulka K., Safar M., Weisser R., Samcova A.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Application Of Game Theory For Load Balancing In Long Term Evolution Networks,"Game theory offers a set of effective tools to be applied in autonomous and distributed self-organizing networks. A typical use case is load balancing which aims at increasing the overall network capacity in case of unequal traffic distribution. The 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) standard provides the means that enables the handover of users from highly loaded cells to the lower loaded neighbors. The method is based on exchanging load Information between neighboring cells. However, the computation of the amount of load that a cell should either offload or accept is running autonomously in each cell and is most likely not generally specified, but rather vendor specific. In this case, a network-wide algorithm for load balancing may not be possible to use if eNodeBs from distinct vendors are deployed. In this game-theoretic analysis for load balancing, we consider each cell as a rational player that decides, in the worst-case, on the amount of load that maximizes its payoff in an uncooperative way. The simulation results for LTE network show that the resulting Nash equilibrium is able to achieve most of the gain expected from a strictly cooperative load balancing scheme. Though each cell acts independently, the Nash equilibrium almost provides the same performance of a network-wide algorithm for load balancing which would ease the players to decide on strategies that are more collaborative. The capacity gain of the Nash equilibrium is verified for the homogeneous network layout, different scenarios and parameter configurations. Moreover, to take real network effects, such as different cell sizes and number of neighbor cells Into consideration, the Nash equilibrium is also tested in the heterogeneous network layout.",eid,2-s2.0-79951836895,Scopus,Frequenz,"Awada A., Viering I., Wegmann B., Klein A.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Assessment Of Functional Capacity And Body Composition Of Overweight Children After An Aerobic Exercise Program Using The Nintendo Wii Console: A Pilot Study,"Background: Obesity is the fastest growing illness in the world and has increased at an alarming rate among children. Many researchers have sought strategies to reduce sedentary lifestyles among children and adolescents. Game therapy is one tool with the potential to promote physical activity, due to children’s appreciation of this type of activity. The aim of the present pilot study was to assess the effects of game therapy on the functional capacity and body composition of overweight children using a program of aerobic exercises on the Nintendo Wii console. Material/Methods: Four overweight children, aged between 7 and 10 years, participated in the study. After a physical and functional assessment, the children underwent 16 aerobic exercise sessions using a video game on the Nintendo Wii that involved running and martial arts. Results: At the end of the study, a reduction of body mass – from 46.62 (±5.15) kg to 45 (±4.97) kg – and BMI was recorded. Abdominal circumference also decreased from 81.62 (±6.57) cm to 79.87 (±6.55) cm and functional capacity improved. Conclusions: These results suggest that active video games can have a positive effect on the physiological and metabolic responses of participants, thereby affecting weight loss.

,Asynchronous Parallel Programming Language Based On The Microsoft.net Platform,"MC# is a programming language for cluster- and GRID-architectures based on asynchronous parallel programming model accepted in Polyphonic C# language (N.Benton, L.Cardelli, C.Fournet; Microsoft Research, Cambridge, UK). Asynchronous methods of Polyphonic C# play two major roles in MC#: 1) as autonomous methods executed on remote machines, and 2) as methods used for delivering messages. The former are identified in MC# as the ""movable methods"", and the latter form a special syntactic class with the elements named ""channels"". Similar to Polyphonic C#, chords are used for defining the channels and as a synchronization mechanism. The MC# channels are generalised naturally to ""bidirectional channels"", which may be used both for sending and receiving messages in the movable methods. The runtime-system of MC# has as the basic operation a copying operation for the object which is scheduled for execution on remote machine. This copy is ""dead"" after the movable method has finished its work, and all changes of this remote copy are not transferred to the original object. Arguments of the movable method are copied together with an original object, but the passing of bidirectional channels is realised through transferring the proxies for such channels. By way of experiments in MC#, we have written a series of parallel programs such as a computation of Fibonacci numbers, walking through binary tree, computation of primes by Eratosthenes sieve, calculation of Mandelbrot set, modeling the Conway's game ""Life"", etc. In all these cases, we got the easy readable and compact code. Also we have an experimental implementation in which the compiler is written in SML.NET, and the execution of movable methods on remote machines is based on the Reflection library of .NET platform. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.",eid,2-s2.0-35248888629,Scopus,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),"Guzev V., Serdyuk Y.",2003,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,"Babes In Bonanzaland: Kid Nation, Commodification, And The Death Of Play","On the Web site for the CBS reality show Kid Nation (2007) the tagline reads: ""40 kids have 40 days to build a brave new world without adults to help or hinder their efforts."" The show takes place in a New Mexico ghost town called Bonanza City, where one can just imagine Lorne Green or Michael Landon lurking somewhere offscreen. The children are charged with creating this new world on their own, a heavy responsibility for a cast ranging in age from eight to fifteen. Aside from the obvious biblical reference to Noah and the Flood, the show offers visual nostalgia for the grand ol' days of a shoot-'em-up Wild West that must be tamed (minus, of course, outlaws or hostile Native Americans). According to Jyotsna Kapur, ""Children are invoked as mediums through which the past [glory and power] can be restored"" (87), and Kid Nation functions as a modern fusion of such ideological themes as civilization versus nature, individual strength against great odds, the glory of the Western frontier, and the innocence of childhood. The series alludes to such cultural artifacts as William Goldings's Lord of the Flies and John Ford westerns. The tagline on the Web site continues, ""Will they come together as a cohesive unit or will they succumb to the childhood temptations that lead to chaos?"" This question challenges broad cultural fantasies of an imagined Victorian-style childhood innocence. In our postmodern society, childhood is increasingly conceived of in nostalgic terms that infuse it with a desire for a ""perfect"" past that has not yet been created. In reality, the postmodern child's material and geographic condition is an increasingly multitextual space: urban, wired, materialist, graphic, and more adultlike; here nostalgia for a ""lost"" childhood works alongside a youth's desire for adult autonomy. Reinforcing that quest for an idealized childhood are the growing communities of ""cyber-real"" space (computer and video games, online communities, text messaging, Facebook, YouTube, and so on), which offer the promise of multiple satisfactions. The image of childhood, as commonly conceived, is being transformed as a result of the constant infusion of technology into daily life. Childhood has become ""staged for public consumption"" (Postman 82-83) to fit a nostalgic ideal of what childhood should be. Kid Nation is one, perhaps inevitable, move toward uniting the reality show with the adult quest for youth in this era of an increasing loss of ""childness."" As Postman argues, broad access to the information superhighway has allowed for a certain level of knowledge now available to children that, in an earlier time, would have been exclusive to adults (85). The line between adult and child in Kid Nation is blurred; it is situated between children's desire to be adult (adultifying) and adult desire to recapture youth. The series attempts to offer a fantasy to both groups. The reality show experience changes the discourse of childhood as a socially negotiated space by authenticating existing social structures in the series' myth of creating a brave new world. The series sets up the typical conflict dynamic between participants expected from a reality show within the coming-of-age frame. This site of mediation between childhood and adulthood in Kid Nation, as a display, requires a reexamination of common assumptions about what it means to be a child in the digital age. The sociopolitical structures implemented in Kid Nation severely restrict the children's ability to actually create the new society that the series promises; instead, childhood is displayed as a condition that must be overcome in the quest for increased productivity in Bonanza City. Kid Nation commodifies childhood and then systematically destroys it. In a paradoxical move, the rhetoric of recaptured youth (free from adults) instead offers the visual and emotional destruction of childhood while the viewer commiserates with the young people trapped within adult social matrices, much like rats in a maze: how will the children negotiate the assigned challenges of money, class, race, religion, prejudice - and their own state of childhood?.

,Biofeedback Rehabilitation In Ophthalmology,"The biofeedback techniques used to treat patients have been around for over a quarter of a century, and the procedures themselves for over half a century. The term ""biofeedback"" was coined in late 1969 to describe laboratory procedures (developed in the 1940's) that trained research subjects to alter brain activity, blood pressure, muscle tension, heart rate and other bodily functions that are not normally controlled voluntarily. Although most people initially viewed these practices with skepticism, researchers proved that many individuals could alter their involuntary responses by ""feeding back"" information either visually or audibly to show what was occurring in their bodies. Today, research has demonstrated that biofeedback can help in the treatment of many diseases and painful conditions. BF techniques applied to vision are still being studied for both their methodological and physiological aspects. Giorgi, Contestabile, and Vingolo et al. have proposed different visual rehabilitation techniques and instruments using biofeedback strategies starting from basic systems like an Accomotrack Vision Trainer (which is a high- speed infrared optometer which records the vergence of light reflected from the retina at a rate of 40 Hz, then converts the signal into an auditory tone which increases in pitch and rate as accommodation decreases; the subject listens to the tone and thus receives immediate auditory feedback as to his/ her accommodative status) or improved biofeedback integrated system (IBIS) devices, merging to more complex instruments as the fundus related MP-1 microperimeter (Nidek Technologies, Padua, Italy). Recently introduced techniques, such as microperimetry by a scanning laser ophthalmoscope (SLO), microperimetry together with the ongoing research targeting the neurophysiology, and neuro-modelling lead us to a better knowledge of the cognitive processes of rehabilitation and can also serve as a useful diagnostic as well as a therapeutic tool for the treatment of retinal disease. Visual training with visually evoked assisted biofeedback has been used to improve performance in high speed drivers and precision shooters. Computer programs for visual stimulation have been used to treat amblyopia, offering to shift the visual training into the domestic sphere. Several randomized control studies on vision training systems, consisting of a background stimulation by a drifting sinusoidal grating, combined with a foreground game aimed at maintaining attention have been reported in this field. Furthermore, visual training has also been used to improve the saccadic performance in dyslexic children with deficitary eye movement control. This indicates that daily practice improved not only perceptual capacity, but also voluntary saccade control within 3 to 8 weeks. After training, the group of dyslexics was no longer statistically different from the control group. This chapter aims to review the history, methodology and application of biofeedback techniques to vision. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

,Brownie: A Platform For Conducting Neurois Experiments,"In the NeuroIS field, experimental software needs to simultaneously present experimental stimuli to participants while recording, analyzing, or displaying neurophysiological measures. For example, a researcher might record a user’s heart beat (neurophysiological measure) as the user interacts with an e-commerce website (stimulus) to track changes in user arousal or show a user’s changing arousal levels during an exciting game. In this paper, we identify requirements for a NeuroIS experimental platform that we call Brownie and present its architecture and functionality. We then evaluate Brownie via a literature review and a case study that demonstrates Brownie’s capability to meet the requirements in a complex research context. We also verify Brownie’s usability via a quantitative study with prospective experimenters who implemented a test experiment in Brownie and an alternative software. We summarize the salient features of Brownie as follows: 1) it integrates neurophysiological measurements, 2) it incorporates real-time processing of neurophysiological data, 3i) it facilitates research on individual and group behavior in the lab, 4) it offers a large variety of options for presenting experimental stimuli, and 5) it is open source and easily extensible with open source libraries. In summary, we conclude that Brownie is innovative in its potential to reduce barriers for IS researchers by fostering replicability and research collaboration and to support NeuroIS and interdisciplinary research in cognate areas, such as management, economics, or human-computer interaction. © 2017 by the Association for Information Systems.",eid,2-s2.0-85018984689,Scopus,Journal of the Association of Information Systems,"Hariharan A., Lux E., Pfeiffer J., Dorner V., Müller M.B., Weinhardt C., Adam M.T.P.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia

In this paper we present our design study for the development of a mod game, Antarctic NWN. We first present the background for the game, objectives, and then discuss the gameplay o f Antarctic NWN. We then explore issues that influence the design of a gripping game. One important issue is the relation between reality, simulation and game word. Then we focus on enhancing emotional involvement. Emotion is especially relevant to role-play game as it draws players into the story, and supports aesthetic understanding. We also look more specifically at the role of humour in this context. Humour enhanceslearning as well as providing a more pleasurable experience.

,"Computer/Gaming Station Use In Youth: Correlations Among Use, Addiction And Functional Impairment","Objective: Computer/gaming station use is ubiquitous in the lives of youth today. Overuse is a concern, but it remains unclear whether problems arise from addictive patterns of use or simply excessive time spent on use. The goal of the present study was to evaluate computer/gaming station use in youth and to examine the relationship between amounts of use, addictive features of use and functional impairment. Method: A total of 110 subjects (11 to 17 years of age) from local schools participated. Time spent on television, video gaming and nongaming recreational computer activities was measured. Addictive features of computer/gaming station use were ascertained, along with emotional/behavioural functioning. Multiple linear regressions were used to understand how youth functioning varied with time of use and addictive features of use. Results: Mean (± SD) total screen time was 4.5±2.4 h/day. Addictive features of use were consistently correlated with functional impairment across multiple measures and informants, whereas time of use, after controlling for addiction, was not. Conclusions: Youth are spending many hours each day in front of screens. In the absence of addictive features of computer/gaming station use, time spent is not correlated with problems; however, youth with addictive features of use show evidence of poor emotional/behavioural functioning. ©2012 Pulsus Group Inc.

,Constitutive Tensions Of Gaming's Field: Uk Gaming Magazines And The Formation Of Gaming Culture 1981-1995,"The paper is based on a study of UK gaming magazines in the 1980s and 90s. It argues that a quasi-autonomous gaming culture was established in the mid-1980s, which established the perceptions and habits that make gaming possible and create the 'gamer' identity. The analysis shows a structural break associated with the introduction of the term 'gameplay' around March 1985, after which the appraisal of games takes on a limited independence from technical, educational and other normative criteria that get applied to other objects in the computer culture. The resulting discourse explains what is and can be meant by 'computer game' in our culture. The thwarted autonomy of gaming discourse then becomes its most interesting characteristic, since it positions gaming as essentially transgressive in relation to key cultural distinctions that it cannot fully leave behind (technology/art; childhood/adulthood; health/pathology). © 2001 - 2012 Game Studies.",eid,2-s2.0-84867597137,Scopus,Game Studies,Kirkpatrick G.,2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Cooperative Expert System Applied To Simulation Of Human Group Behavior,"This paper describes a model for a cooperative expert system which simulates human group behavior. When social phenomena are observed, Fujitsu has realized that experts usually act autonomously. But there are also many cases when experts must work in close cooperation. The major design goal of this study is to construct a framework to naturally represent cooperation among expert systems. Since expert systems interact only via conversation, an expert system cannot access or change another expert's knowledge base without the owner's permission. This system can also process non-deterministic tasks by parallel inference.",eid,2-s2.0-0024078804,Scopus,Fujitsu Scientific and Technical Journal,"Watanabe Nobuo, Kimoto Takashi",1988,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Differential Hemispheric Activation During Complex Visuomotor Performance: Pong,"The objective of this study was to assess the degree to which asymmetry of the human EEG was related to the efficiency of overt performance in a complex visuomotor task. The hypothesis was that EEG alpha power, which is presumably inversely proportional to cortical activation, is functionally lateralized according to task demands: e.g., a decrease in alpha power in the right hemisphere during 'non-verbal' performance. The hypothesis was tested by engaging subjects in several processing tasks utilizing different modes and degrees of information processing. Bilateral EEG's were recorded from central, temporal, and partial scalp locations from 7 male and 7 female Ss. All Ss were right handed as determined by questionnaire and family history. Ss were given training trials on the day preceding testing to minimize unfamiliarity, and stabilize learning performance. All tasks were conducted with eyes open. Spectrum power in the alpha band was higher in the right hemisphere when Ss listened to a verbal passage and reversed when they performed in an imaginative block rotation task. The most task dependent asymmetry occurred over the angular gyrus. Compared to intergame baselines, mean square power was suppressed in the right hemisphere when Ss either watched or played PONG (Video Tennis). The fact that watching PONG was nearly as effective in producing alpha asymmetry as playing the game implied that the asymmetry was due mostly to perceptual rather than motor factors. Within task variables were examined to more closely determine the functional relationship between overt performance on the visuomotor task and EEG alpha asymmetry. The number of PONG hits per rally was an inverted 'U' function of right hemisphere arousal: i.e., the number of PONG hits was greatest for a moderate asymmetry rather than for the greatest level of right hemisphere activation. These results support previous findings concerning task induction of EEG asymmetry, but in addition indicate that fluctuations of EEG asymmetry within a task relate systematically to variations in overt performance.",eid,2-s2.0-0017658629,Scopus,Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology,Rebert C.S.,1977,NA,NA,reviewer2,Lydia

,"E-Learning Sudan, Formal Learning For Out-Of-School Children","E-Learning Sudan (ELS) is a custom-built computer/tablet game that provides alternative learning opportunities to Sudanese children who are excluded from education. Unique in ELS is that children can learn mathematics, in their own remote village, without a teacher. This research study assessed the effectiveness of ELS in two pilots through a pretest– posttest control group quasi-experimental design. In Pilot I, 67 children in three remote villages, aged used the game for a period of six weeks, five days a week, 45 minutes a day; the control group did not receive any education.. In Pilot II, 591 children in 19 remote villages, played the game for six months, for a maximum of five times a week, 45 minutes a day; the control group received informal education in out-of-school centers. The results of the analysis on the pretest–posttest data revealed that ELS increased mathematics knowledge acquisition in numeracy and adding significantly and maintained student motivation to learn. Analyses of control group data and EGMA (internationally validates Early Grade Mathematics Assessment) showed that the children in the experimental group learned more than children who received no education at all, informal or formal education. These findings suggest that the implementation of ELS can greatly benefit learning for out-of-school children like in Sudan. © ACPIL.",eid,2-s2.0-84968901921,Scopus,Electronic Journal of e-Learning,"Stubbé H., Badri A., Telford R., van der Hulst A., van Joolingen W.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia

Sixteen low trait anxiety subjects and 17 high trait anxiety subjects selected with the Cattell self-analysis sheet (scores 0, 1 and 2 on the one hand and 9 and 10 on the other) were invited to take part in a mathematical video game. The game was presented as quite easy and as allowing a monetary gain. In fact, the game was faked and the subjects never reached the criterion of success. High trait anxiety subjects proved to be in a higher state anxiety than the low trait anxiety subjects during the experiment. Though non-anxious subjects' SCR amplitude was constant, this parameter decreased in anxious subjects as the game proceeded suggesting EDA inhibition in the latter.

,Facial Expression Mirroring-Based Classification Of Emotions Using Electroencephalogram Signals,"People have lived in a way delivering many messages through various non-verbal communicative means such as facial expressions and voice tones. Recently, many researchers have attempted to do tasks dealing with emotions conveyed through some immanent bio- signals for human-computer interaction or human-robot interaction. If we switch some applications of bio-signals dominantly occupied to cure the handicapped or the rehabilitant to entertainment areas including video games, artificial life and interactive theaters, this will provide us with a solution to overcome drawbacks caused by traditional interfaces in which it may allow us to more naturally experience human-oriented contents. In this paper, we present a mechanism to do analysis of electroencephalogram signals originated from emotional impulses and to carry out classification of the emotion. Also we have validated the methods to foresee usability for brain-computer interface. The partial derivatives of EEG are taken as features for some training data set gained from facial expression mirroring. Four emotions including neutral, anger, happiness, and surprise have been classified using the support vector machines.

,Frustrating The User On Purpose: A Step Toward Building An Affective Computer,"Using a deliberately slow computer-game-interface to induce a state of hypothesised frustration in users, we collected physiological, video and behavioural data, and developed a strategy for coupling these data with real-world events. The effectiveness of our strategy was tested in a study with thirty six subjects, where the system was shown to reliably synchronise and gather data for affect analysis. A pattern-recognition strategy known as Hidden Markov Models was applied to each subject's physiological signals of skin conductivity and blood volume pressure in an effort to see if regimes of likely frustration could be automatically discriminated from regimes when frustration was much less likely. This pattern-recognition approach performed significantly better than random guessing at classifying the two regimes. Mouse-clicking behaviour was also synchronised to frustration-eliciting events and analysed, revealing four distinct patterns of clicking responses. We provide recommendations and guidelines for using physiology as a dependent measure for HCI experiments, especially when considering human emotions in the HCI equation. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

However, most existing avatar communication systems do not take avatars' social backgrounds into consideration. This paper proposes a novel humanoid avatar animation system to represent personalities and facial emotions of avatars based on culture, profession, mood, age, taste, and so forth. We extract semantic keywords from the input text through natural language processing, and then the animations of personalized avatars are retrieved and displayed according to the order of the keywords. Our primary work is focused on giving avatars run-time instruction from multiple natural languages. Experiments with Chinese, Japanese and English input based on the prototype show that interactive avatar animations can be displayed in real time and be made available online. This system provides a more natural and interesting means of human communication, and therefore is expected to be used for cross-cultural communication, multiuser online games, and other entertainment applications.",eid,2-s2.0-78649577032,Scopus,"World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology","Hou J., Wang X., Xu F., Nguyena V.D., Wu L.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia

While refraining from the familiar debate over whether games are in fact art, this article argues that a valuable and previously unexplored framework for analyzing their aesthetic character is John Dewey's pragmatist aesthetics. Spectatorial and institutional approaches are rejected on the grounds that they do not speak to the unique qualities of the video game medium. Dewey's aesthetic theory gives a central place to interactivity and embodiment, critical elements of video games.

Subjects completed 5 laps of a computer motor racing game whilst listening to either arousing or relatively unarousing music in either the presence or absence of a backward-counting task. Both these manipulations affected performance on the game with arousing music and backward-counting leading to slower lap times than relatively unarousing music and the absence of the backward-counting task. Backward-counting led to lower liking for the music than did the absence of this task. These results support the idea that music and the concurrent task competed for a limited processing resource.

The experimental framework has features that have been emulated from the popular DOOM™ computer game. It implements an integrated parser based on a linguistic formalism tailored to the processing of the specific natural language instructions required to control a player character. This parser outputs structured message formats to the animation layer, which further interprets these messages to generate behaviours for the scene objects. We have found that interactive control significantly impacts on the behavioural interpretation of natural language semantics. Besides bringing stringent requirements in terms of response times for the natural language processing step, it determines the level of autonomy that the animated character should possess, which in turn influences the generation of behavioural scripts from natural language instructions. &copy; Springer-Verlag London Ltd.",eid,2-s2.0-0008541250,Scopus,Virtual Reality,"Cavazza M., Palmer I.",1999,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia

,New Perspectives On Employee Motivation: Balancing The Big 4,"The concept of “flow,” popularized by Mihály Csikszentmihalyi, is an intrinsic and highly focused state of motivation. Initially, it has been studied for video game players, but the effect has recently been cited across various disciplines. Flow can occur when there is the right balance between the challenge [C] of a task and the corresponding skill set [S] of the individual performing the task. Recent research findings shed light on how to balance these two factors and create optimal flow conditions in the workplace. The findings translate into management tools that provide an atmosphere which encourages high engagement and performance. Flow is also a highly energized state where senses and emotions are in full alignment with the task that is carried out. A motivational framework therefore needs to take a second dimension into account. It has to balance the workload [WL] of an employee and his/her capacity to work [CW], thus ensuring that the mid-term and long-term effectiveness of employees is maintained. Pushing employees down an energy-depleting path can quickly lead to a drop in performance or even fatigue or burn-out. Instead, organizations need to apply strategies to leverage wellsprings and effectively reenergize their workforce. Balancing the Big 4 factors challenge [C] vs. skill [S], and workload [WL] vs. capacity to work [CW], are the centerpiece of the resulting new framing of employee motivation. It can help to increase satisfaction and achievements of employees and thus boost the effectiveness of organizations. © Common Ground, Melanie Seemann, Thomas Seemann, All Rights Reserved.",eid,2-s2.0-84960492891,Scopus,"International Journal of Knowledge, Culture and Change Management","Seemann M., Seemann T.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia

This investigation tested all three aspects of emotion (subjective, physiologic changes, and performance). Nine male goalies completed questionnaires and provided salivary cortisol before, during, and after each game. Heart rate (ECG signal) was integrated with the goalie's performance video. Goalies rated on Likert Scales; headaches, stomach aches, insomnia, nervousness, and awareness of heart pounding. Data from 16 games were obtained. Of nine, two goalies provided data on three games each; one goalie was classified as a responder and the other a non-responder, based on salivary cortisol levels (SCL).

,Reading With Preschool Children Guided By Regulatory Or Emancipatory Purposes: A Case Study,"The theoretical framework guiding this article builds on the tension between the differing perspectives on literacy learning: is it best taught using autonomous activities or activities embedded in a social, historical, and cultural context as described by the autonomous versus the ideological model for literacy. The read-aloud practices have been studied in one case study (data from interviews, lengthy observations, focus group interviews, artifacts, video recordings) of a preschool where thematic work guided the activities. They were also examined in one larger study where preschool teachers and teacher trainees documented the reading activities, by use of observation schedules, during one week in forty different preschools. Converging evidence indicate a tension between planned language games and phonics exercises on the one hand and on the other hand child initiated emergent literacy activities, such as pretend reading and prewriting. The emergent literacy activities were observed in connection with thematic work. In the larger sample of preschools, thematic work did not occur and the purpose of the read-alouds was predominantly regulatory or disciplinary to make the children rest.

,Reclaiming Public Spaces Through Performance Of The Zombie Walk,"With the stench of rotting flesh, the guttural, animalistic groans and the haunting noise of their dragging limbs, zombies have managed to remain a frightful mythical monster in popular culture. Zombies are bodies without emotions, acting on primal instincts alone. They speak to everything that we as humans are not supposed to be. Their predisposition toward brains, flesh, blood and gore creates an uncomfortable fascination for horror fans. However, I would argue that the popularity of zombies in North America is also largely attributable to the fact that their very existence counters many dominant norms that circulate within our society, specifically calling us to question ideas surrounding beautiful bodies, life and death, structured spaces, and mass consumption. In a capitalist economy fuelled by the pathological need for continual growth, it becomes clear that the zombie of modern film and television often acts as a stand-in for the true cultural dupes of mass consumption: us (Dendle 2007, 51). They also symbolize apocalyptic events, when humans and all their daily spaces and practices are slowly taken over by the undead: Animated corpses. In popular zombie films, the undead are almost always portrayed in public spaces, walking-or dragging- Themselves from place to place, consuming in the most literal of ways (i.e., eating human flesh). As they move slowly through public spaces, invoking fear in the humans around them, they take on a familiar appearance: us, just going through the motions. The commentary here is clear: we, too, can be zombies, even if our hearts are still beating. The popularity of zombies is found not only in the abundance of zombie films created over the years (Night of the Living Dead, Army of Darkness, 28 Days Later and Shaun of the Dead, to name but a few), but also in the ways that zombies have infiltrated our daily lives. The flesh and gore associated with zombies have managed to creep their way into nearly every facet of popular culture-works of fiction and comic books (The Zombie Survival Guide, Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, The Walking Dead, Blackest Night); video games (Left 4 Dead, Resident Evil, Dead Rising); board games (Zombies!!!, Last Night on Earth); music (""Walk like a Zombie"" by the HorrorPops, Rob Zombie, Zombie Girl); and even zombie pinups and porn (ZombiePinups. com, Porn of the Dead). One of the most interesting examples of zombies in everyday culture is the zombie walk, in which mass groups of the ""living dead"" congregate in large cities all over North America and Western Europe, and march in the streets. This is a relatively recent phenomenon, with the first documented, non-commercial zombie walk taking place in Toronto, Ontario, in 2003 (Dalgetty 2007). These walks are comprised of individuals, primarily teenagers and young adults, dressed and made up as zombies, walking, shuffling and dragging themselves slowly through urban spaces. As the zombies shuffle and drag themselves along, they cause a spectacle: They halt traffic, stop pedestrians from shopping ""normally,"" disturb onlookers and raise questions. Because our urban spaces are highly ordered and regulated places, the purposeful disruption of the zombie walk-the performance of the living dead in public areas-affords the opportunity to reclaim urban spaces and disrupt dominant ideologies, even if only momentarily. Very few monsters have managed to embed themselves within the popular imagination as successfully as zombies. Although most monsters originate in folklore, then move to literature and finally enter mainstream cinema, the zombie is one of the few monsters that has moved directly from folklore to the popular imagination (McIntosh 2008, 2). McIntosh notes that our fascination with zombies seems to trace back to Haitian folklore via the ethnographies of ethnobiologist Wade Davis. According to his reports, there are two types of literal zombies: The spirit zombies (zombie jardin) and the type that has made its way into popular culture: The body raised from the dead (zombie corps cadavre) (2). The zombies-or victims-are put into a near-death state by means of a poisonous mixture made in part from the toxins of a blowfish and then later revived through the use of another mixture (3). Through this process, the victims end up losing many of their mental faculties, functioning at a much slower pace than normal, allowing them to be easily controlled by the individual who poisoned them. Although such descriptions can be found in a few travelogues dating back to the late eighteenth century, it was not until the US military occupation of Haiti from 1915 to 1934 that Haitian folklore began to make its way out of Haiti and into American news reports and cultural imaginaries (McIntosh 2008, 4). As with many cultural exports, accuracy was not of most importance in disseminating this new information. Instead, a sensationalized and magical image of Haitian voodoo began to be promoted. It was specifically the image of a slowmoving individual in a trance-like state that became the model for the horror monsters we see today. Entering the scene in 1932, with Kenneth Webb's stage production of Zombie, and later that year with the first zombie film, White Zombie (Halperin brothers), the majority of the content of these films dealt with female possession for men's sexual pleasure and/or black-white racial issues (McIntosh 2008, 5). The zombies in these films generally stayed the same, with only a simple change of scenery to suit the era's political climate. For the most part, they were simply slow versions of humans, with less tidy clothing. McIntosh notes that this all changed- And would forever change the face of zombie films thereafter- with George A. Romero's 1968 Night of the Living Dead (8). Both that film and Romero's following two films, Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead, deal with issues pertinent to North American culture. They provide a visual commentary for the horrific aspects of our culture that we normally do not question. Night of the Living Dead predominantly takes place in a family's farmhouse and depicts the characters fighting for their lives against a horde of zombies that threaten to infiltrate from the outside. ""Much of the narrative attention,"" Dendle contends, ""is thus devoted not to attacks or human-zombie conflicts, but to re-examining the middle-class household of heartland America"" (2007, 50). The movement from urban spaces into gated communities allowed individuals to better defend their modern homes, values and ideals against the monstrous ""other"" that lurked outside the door. This apocalyptic sense is also evident in Dawn of the Dead, ""a social commentary on American mass consumer society as zombies overtake survivors barricaded in a shopping mall, and Day of the Dead, when the world is apparently almost completely overrun by zombies and there are only a few survivors left"" (McIntosh 2008, 9). Romero's films are important for the simple reason that they forever changed public perception of the zombie and allow for an intriguing, easily accessible creature that has quickly become the monster of choice for many performances. To properly situate the zombie walk as a performance of subversion and reclamation, the construction of our current city spaces needs to be discussed. How do these spaces limit the possibility for subversion and social upheaval? Also, the zombie walk is a particular type of performance that draws heavily from the Situationist International's theory of détournement: The reclaiming of already existing objects/spaces/ideas found in society and then using them for alternative purposes. Finally, the performance of the undead, though tinged with political curiosity, is a site of extreme playfulness. It is within the space of performance and play that the zombie walk is able to momentarily subvert dominant social norms and replace them with the utterly grotesque. © 2011 by University of Ottawa Press.",eid,2-s2.0-84903678520,Scopus,Braaaiiinnnsss!: From Academics to Zombies,Cocarla S.,2011,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Sex Differences In The Development Of Higher Systolic Blood Pressure During Adolescence,"We evaluated the differences in higher systolic blood pressure (SBP) between boys and girls in a longitudinal adolescent cohort. Results showed that although boys have a 19% relative increase in the risk of higher SBP annually between the ages of 13 and 17 years, girls do not experience the same risk increase. Among both boys and girls, being overweight increases the likelihood of high SBP almost 3-fold, and every 5 additional hours of ""screen time"" (television viewing, video game playing, internet use) is associated with a 4% relative increase in the likelihood of higher SBP levels. For every 5 additional sports-related or other active behaviors over a 7-day recall, there was an 8% relative reduction in high SBP risk. Annual blood pressure assessment in teens that continues into adulthood may facilitate early detection of adult hypertension. Weight control, increased physical activity, and reduced screen time may reduce the likelihood of higher SBP levels developing in adolescents.",eid,2-s2.0-48249141446,Scopus,Cardiology Review,Dasgupta K.,2008,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Solving Mathematical Puzzles: A Challenging Competition For Ai,"Since its origin, the holy grail of artificial intelligence has been to understand the nature of intelligence and to engineer systems that exhibit such intelligence through vision, language, emotion, motion, and reasoning. In such context, AI researchers have always looked for challenges to push forward the limit of what computers can do autonomously and to measure the level of ""intelligence"" achieved. Competitions have been and are currently run on conversational behavior (for example, the Loebner prize1), automatic control (for example, the International Aerial Robotics Competition2 or the DARPA Grand Challenge on driverless cars3), cooperation and coordination in robotics (for example, the RoboCup4), logic reasoning and knowledge (for example, the CADE ATP System competition for theorem provers5), and natural language (for example, the EVALITA competition6 for the Italian language). Historically, also games have raised the interest of the AI community: A number of competitions are still being held nowadays (for example, the World Computer Chess Championship, 7 Mario Championship8 [Togelius et al. 2013] and its successor Platformer Competition,9 the General Game Playing competition10).

,The Effectiveness Of Casual Video Games In Improving Mood And Decreasing Stress,"Stress related medical disorders such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and depression are serious medical issues that can cause disability and death. Techniques to prevent their development and exacerbation are needed. Casual video games (CVGs) are fun, easy to play, spontaneous and are tremendously popular. In this randomized controlled study we tested the effects of CVGs on mood and stress by comparing people playing CVGs with control subjects under similar conditions. Electroencephalography (EEG) changes during game play were consistent with increased mood and corroborated findings on psychological reports. Moreover, heart rate variability (HRV) changes were consistent with autonomic nervous system relaxation or decreased physical stress. In some cases CVGs produced different brain wave, heart rate variability and psychological effects. These finding have broad implications which include the potential development of prescriptive interventions using casual video games to prevent and treat stress related medical disorders. © Virtual Reality Medical Institute.",eid,2-s2.0-77956912218,Scopus,Journal of Cyber Therapy and Rehabilitation,"Russoniello C.V., O'Brien K., Parks J.M.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,The Impact Of Wii Fit™ Yoga Training On Flexibility And Heart Rate,"Background: Flexibility training is an often overlooked, but nevertheless important component of overall fitness, health and athletic performance and is positively impacted by flexibility training. Emerging technologies, including the Wii Fit™, offer an alternative to traditional flexibility training. To date however, no research has examined the impact of the flexibility component of the Wii Fit™ on upper and lower body flexibility. Research question: The purpose of the study was to determine the impact of a four week Wii Fit™ yoga training session on flexibility and heart rate. Type of study: A pre-test post-test control group design was used. Methods: Healthy, moderately active participants (N = 32) were randomly assigned to either a training (N=14) or control (N=18) group, where the training group completed four weeks of WiiTM flexibility training and flexibility test practice, for three sessions a week. Flexibility was assessed for both the control group and training groups prior to and after the training sessions, using the sit and reach and shoulder flexibility tests. Results: Significant improvements in both upper and lower body flexibility were noted for the Wii Fit™ users, while the control group showed no changes in flexibility over the testing period. Conclusions: Data suggest that the flexibility training provided by the Wii Fit™ yoga exercises have a significant impact on upper and lower body flexibility, suggesting the Wii Fit™ can be effectively utilised as part of overall flexibility training.",eid,2-s2.0-84880355543,Scopus,International SportMed Journal,"McCarthy H., Brazil S.T., Greene J.C., Rendell S., Rohr L.E.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Transformative Interactions: Designing Positive Technologies To Foster Self-Transcendence And Meaning,"In the last years, there has been a growing interest in the role of selftranscendent positive emotions - such as awe, elevation and admiration - in fostering wellbeing and personal development. In particular, recent studies suggest that the experience of these emotions can promote self-improvement, prosocial behaviour and feelings of spirituality. The goal of this contribution is to introduce Computer-Mediated Self-transcendence (CMST) as a possible new research pathway in Positive Technology, which refers to the use of interactive technologies for promoting, facilitating or enhancing emotional peak experiences. Specifically, we suggest that the goal of CMST can be achieved by combining virtual reality, videogames and the languages of art, to design mediated transformative experiences that include emotional and epistemic affordances. We describe some early examples of CMST and discuss opportunities and challenges of this approach. © 2016 by Interactive Media Institute.",eid,2-s2.0-85019584129,Scopus,Annual Review of CyberTherapy and Telemedicine,"Gaggioli A., Chirico A., Triberti S., Riva G.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Utility-Driven Non-Cooperative Game Model Of Optimal Resource Allocation For Economic Grid,"In grid environment based on economic model, grid users who submit jobs and grid resource providers who provide resources have different motivations. Due to autonomy both in gird users and resource providers, their objectives often conflict. This paper researches grid resource allocation problem by using non-cooperative game theory. Combined with economic grid model, two resource allocation mechanisms reflecting supply and demand relation are proposed from two angles of grid users and resources. The Nash equilibrium solution of users' optimal bidding and the Nash equilibrium solution of resource providers' optimal allocation share are solved respectively by using utility functions that express the objectives of two grid entities. Finally, combined with respective interests of two gamers, a joint optimal allocation policy that provides a solution of joint optimization of the objectives for both the grid user and grid resource is proposed. Simulation results show that the non-cooperative game models of resource allocation not only regulate grid user's bidding and resource allocation, but also yield better performance on fairness, equilibrium and rationality. © 2011 Binary Information Press.",eid,2-s2.0-79551621213,Scopus,Journal of Computational Information Systems,"Zhang X., Li C., Qian Q.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer2,Lydia

,Decentralized Network Design,"Most overlay networks are designed by a centralized algorithm, which takes the participating nodes and returns a set of edges connecting the nodes. We study the possible results of decentralizing overlay network design. What would happen if the individual nodes in the network were asked to choose their own connections? We use techniques from game theory to consider issues such as the stability and fairness of the resulting networks. We define and study several games, all with relevant applications.   First, we study variants of the Bounded Budget Connection (BBC) game, in which each node has some budget to spend on outgoing links and wants to minimize its distance to other nodes in the network. The BBC game has applications in social networks as well as peer-to-peer and overlay networks. We show that this game does not always guarantee a stable network. However, if we allow nodes to fractionally purchase links, as in the fractional BBC game, then a stable solution always exists, although it may be hard to find. We give existence and hardness results for fractional BBC games, as well as for two other fractional games: the fractional Shortest Paths Problem (SPP) game, which is motivated by the routing behavior of Autonomous Systems on the internet using the Border Gateway Protocol, and the preference game, a very simple fractional game which is a specialization of both fractional BBC and fractional SPP games. We study a new equilibrium solution concept for matrix games, called personalized equilibria, which generalizes all of these fractional games as well as modeling scenarios where players can choose how to combine other players' actions to suit their individual interests. Finally, we study the interaction between a centralized algorithm placing resources in the network and nodes choosing their own edges or routes – a variant of multicommodity facility location in which clients pay the cost of a minimum group Steiner tree connecting them to commodities of interest.",pq_id,304966110,proquest_dt,NA,"Ma, Laura Jane Poplawski",2009,THES,Ph.D.,reviewer2,Lydia
,Emotion Modelling With Human Belief Revision In Computer Games.,"Emotion modelling is receiving more and more attention from various fields, e.g. cognitive science, psychology, computer science and neuroscience. Most of these fields share the common research consensus that emotion can be beneficial to human's mental activities. This thesis is also grounded on the same consensus and makes further validations based on the following two hypotheses: One is emotional agents in games should behave more like human beings than emotionless agents; the other is that agents having full emotional architecture should obtain better playing performance than agents with only partial architecture. Based on theoretical support, the author further hypothesizes that peoples' long term belief can be one of the sources to release complex emotions. The experiment result suggests the emotional agents did perform significantly better than emotionless ones, but it was unable to significantly reflect the advantages from fully structured emotional agents over the ones of the partial architecture.",pq_id,33791611,proquest_dt,NA,"Ma, Yan",2007,THES,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Incentive-Centered Design For Scheduling In Parallel And Distributed Systems,"Distributed systems comprise components that are owned and operated by autonomous organizations. These organizations are rational (self-interested and welfare-maximizing) and they have no a prior motivation for cooperation. Rationality leads them to manipulate the systems if it benefits them to do so. Organizations respond to incentives. To prevent manipulations, incentives must be explicitly aligned with the system's objectives. Incentive-centered design (ICD), which integrates the motivational human behavior aspect of social sciences with the computational tractability aspect of computer science, specifically addresses these concerns and provides methods to mitigate them.   We examine the incentives present in several distributed system resource allocation problems. We model these problems as games and then used ICD to devise protocols that obtained their desired objectives in a self-interested, competitive setting. The first problems we examine are designing incentive-compatible mechanisms for scheduling divisible loads in distributed systems. Divisible loads is a form of data parallelism in which large data sets are partitioned into fractions. All fractions require an identical type of processing. Scheduling requires knowledge of the processors. Since the processors are rational, they may choose to misreport their capacities, which adversely affects the quality of scheduling. We design several mechanisms that obtain optimal schedules in this setting. Each mechanism is specific to a network architecture as the architecture affects partitioning and the optimality conditions. We examine three architectures: bus, linear, and tree networks. For the bus network, we design three classical centralized mechanisms. The centralized mechanisms are not feasible for the tree and linear networks as the processors cannot communicate directly with the mechanism center, a limitation of these architectures. Instead, we design distributed mechanisms in which the information and algorithms are distributed throughout the network. These mechanisms introduce new avenues for manipulation and we address this by creating incentives for processors to monitor one another. We then examine divisible load scheduling using coalitional games. An application owner receives a payoff when her job is finished. The amount she receives though decreases with time and furthermore, the payoff must be shared with the processors computing her job. She forms a coalition with a set of processors to maximize her profit, which is the difference between payoff and costs. We model this problem as a coalitional game and we show that stable coalitions between application users and processors occur.   We next examine parallel job scheduling in parallel systems comprising identical processors. A parallel job differs from a sequential job or task in that it can execute on two or more processors. We consider two different types of parallel job scheduling. The first type we examine is the batch scheduling of rigid jobs. Batch scheduling requires that all jobs are present at the start of scheduling. A parallel job is rigid if it requires a fixed number of processors. If fewer processors are assigned, the job fails. If more processors are assigned, the job does not speedup. Associated with each job is a deadline and payoff. The job's owner receives the payoff if her job completes by its deadline; otherwise, her payoff is zero. The scheduling objective then is to maximize the sum of payoffs. The users are rational: they will misreport their jobs' parameters if it benefits them to do so. We design an incentive-compatible scheduling mechanism aimed specifically for this problem. Because the mechanism is incentive compatible, rational users choose to truthfully declare their parameters to the scheduler. The second type of parallel job scheduling we consider is the online scheduling of malleable jobs. Online scheduling differs from the batch scheduling in that the scheduler cannot foresee jobs arriving in advance. The scheduling objective must be optimized with the lack of information. Unlike rigid jobs, a malleable jobs can be adapted to execute on any number of processors. Each job is associated with an arrival time (release time), deadline, and payoff. Similar to the rigid job problem, if the job completes by its deadline the self-interested user receives the payoff, otherwise, she receives zero. Besides the online aspect, this problem differs from the rigid one in that the scheduler must choose the number of processors to assign to the job. For this problem we design an online, incentive-compatible mechanism. If a job is scheduled to execute, the mechanism assigns it the number of processors that minimizes its execution time.",pq_id,305016982,proquest_dt,NA,"Carroll, Thomas E.",2009,THES,Ph.D.,reviewer2,Lydia
,Mac Aware Routing Protocols In Wireless Ad Hoc Networks.,"This thesis studies efficient load-aware and multi-path routing for wireless ad hoc networks. Due to the lack of fixed infrastructure and centralized management, ad hoc networks need to be autonomous operating and self-organizing. These operations mainly rely on highly distributed and dynamic routing protocols. However, developing ad hoc routing protocols is challenging for reasons such as dynamic topologies, resource constraints and the broadcasting nature of wireless medium and directional transceiver. We present routing protocols for ad hoc networks that use Medium Access Control (MAC) information as indicators for making routing decisions. Traffic load information of ad hoc networks is investigated and a delay-based load metric that includes MAC channel contention information is used in the load aware routing. Ad hoc networks with directional antenna are also investigated from the perspective of routing scheme. A routing protocol based on transmit direction instead of next-hop is proposed to take advantage of the directional feature. This thesis also presents a game theoretic approach to the routing of multiple real-time multimedia streams through multiple shared links with different link quality metrics.",pq_id,33769718,proquest_dt,NA,"Li, Yang",2008,THES,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Procedural Animation Of Emotionally Expressive Gaze Shifts In Virtual Embodied Characters,"Believably animated virtual human characters appear in many diverse fields of computer science research and areas of the technology industry, including video games, animated films, and virtual training environments. In these applications, animated virtual humans play roles ranging from friendly companions, to helpful tutors, to vicious villains. A key aspect that distinguishes these applications is user interaction. In video games and virtual training environments, interaction between virtual human characters and human users is required, in contrast to animated films. However, the animation methods that produce often very believable behavior for these animated films do not apply well to interactive domains. This leads to an expressivity gap between those animated virtual humans which are interactive and those which are not.    One ability that non-interactive animated characters possess and interactive characters do not is the ability to reveal important information about their emotional state through the use of glances or glares while the character remains silent. The goal of this research is to provide this ability to interactive characters. It does so through a gaze model capable of displaying a desired selection of physical behaviors while directing gaze towards an arbitrary target. This model of gaze, called the Expressive Gaze Model (EGM), combines body movement based on motion capture data with eye movement based on visual neuroscience data.    In addition, this research provides an empirically determined preliminary mapping between gaze behavior and emotional attribution. The results demonstrate that by obtaining a set of low-level gaze behaviors annotated with emotional data, and then generating gaze shifts through the composition of these low-level behaviors, the attribution of emotion to the resulting gaze shift can be predicted. This indicates that gaze shifts that display emotion states can be generated from these low-level gaze behaviors without using motion capture of the displayed emotion.",pq_id,304463399,proquest_dt,NA,"Lance, Brent Jason",2008,THES,Ph.D.,reviewer2,Lydia
,Rain In Vision And Graphics,"Rain produces sharp intensity fluctuations in images and videos which severely degrade the performance of outdoor vision systems. Removing the visual effects of rain is therefore important in order to make outdoor vision robust to rain. In contrast, in graphics, rain effects are desirable as they are often used to convey scene emotions in movies and in other graphics applications, such as games, to enhance realism. Developing efficient algorithms for realistic rendering of rain effects is however challenging. This thesis, studies rain from the perspective of vision and graphics. We have two main goals - (1) to understand the visual appearance of rain and (2) to develop efficient algorithms both for handling its effects in vision and for its realistic rendering in graphics.    We begin by modeling the visual appearance of rain. We describe the appearance by modeling the photometric intensities produced by individual raindrops and the space-time correlation produced by the motion of a large number of rain drops. We then use these appearance models to develop two complementary approaches to handle the effects of rain on vision systems. The first approach uses a post-processing algorithm for detection and removal of rain from videos that have already been captured. In the second approach we use our appearance model to show that the unique physical properties of rain—its small size, high velocity and spatial distribution—makes its visibility depend strongly on camera parameters. This dependence is used to reduce the visibility of rain during image acquisition by judiciously selecting camera parameters. Conversely, camera parameters can also be chosen to enhance the visibility of rain. This ability can be used to develop an inexpensive and portable camera-based rain gauge that provides instantaneous rain-rate measurements.    In graphics, we have developed two models for realistic rendering of rain. In the first model we consider the complex appearance patterns produced by close by raindrops. We show that these patterns are produced due to the rapid shape distortions (i.e. oscillations) that a raindrop undergoes as it falls and develop a physics-based model to faithfully render these complex appearance patterns. This model is then used to develop an efficient algorithm for rendering rain in images and videos. In the second work, we focus on realistic rendering of material-dependent splashing of raindrops. Here we measure raindrop splashes for 22 different realworld materials. These measurements are then used to build a compact stochastic model that accurately captures the material and inclination dependent splashing behavior of raindrops. Additionally, it allows a user to render physically plausible splashes for novel materials that have not been measured. These two methods have advanced the state of the art algorithms for rendering rain. We believe that this thesis presents a new approach for modeling dynamic weather effects and has opened new avenues for research in vision and graphics.",pq_id,304653149,proquest_dt,NA,"Garg, Kshitiz",2008,THES,Ph.D.,reviewer2,Lydia
,"Robot Motion Planning For Tracking And Capturing Adversarial, Cooperative And Independent Targets","The last ten years have seen robots become smaller, lighter and more maneuverable than ever before, paving the way for their use in the service sector, and even in our homes. A key aspect that elevates a network of robots over a bed of sensors is the ability of individual units to autonomously navigate, forming a sensor-actuator network. These added degrees of freedom demand that we revisit existing motion planning and navigation algorithms and extend them to be able to better contribute to the services they are designed to provide.   In deploying autonomous robots away from laboratory-controlled settings and in to real-world environments, care must be taken because they share their space with other autonomous agents. For instance, a typical home robot has to account for people as well as their pets. Imparting a fair degree of autonomy to robot navigation tasks thus requires reasoning about the mobility of other entities in the path-planning process. This is not a trivial task because such agents can not often be easily characterized or quantified, e.g. human navigation depends on many factors including the perception of hazards, experience from long-term memory, even whim.   In this thesis, we take a deep look at the role of the information available to path-planning algorithms in the context of the mobile target-tracking problem. We start with the problem formulation (Chapter 2), in which robots need to keep track of a single mobile target for as long a duration of time as possible. In the game-theoretic sense, the information available to the target has a different characteristic than the information available to the robots. For example, target behavior varies from adversarial ones in defense applications to cooperative ones in service applications. In the chapters that follow, we present the main contributions of this thesis with this role of information during the path-planning process being the common thread.   Traditional surveillance applications assume the worst-case – the target is an adversary actively trying to escape from the robots. We model this strategic interaction with the theory of pursuit-evasion games, wherein a robot pursues a target, which in turn tries to evade it. We study a mathematical variant of the Lion and Man game in the presence of an obstacle, and show that the final outcome of whether the lion can track down the man depends, in closed form, on the initial conditions (Chapter 3). We derive optimal player strategies that work regardless of what the other player does, thus providing the worst-case guarantees that such applications demand.   At the opposite end of the spectrum, there exist service applications where the target’s trajectory is known to the robots before they need to move. Our motivating example is mobile telepresence, or virtual presence – an emerging technology that enables people to participate in environments they are not physically present in. Specifically, we present a navigation algorithm for a first-of-its-kind person-following robot with telepresence and monitoring applications (Chapter 4). We require that in the presence of another person, the robot should ensure a safe distance by following that person’s path without losing track. We present a heuristic planning approach that accounts for both non-holonomic constraints and trajectory smoothness. Further, a control-theoretic implementation is provided.   Targets that navigate autonomously usually do so with their own intentions. While it is uncertain how they navigate, their behavior may neither be adversarial, nor completely known to the robots in advance. We present a novel data-driven probabilistic mobility model that can be used by path planners to reason about the uncertainties in decisions made by an individual who is navigating in an indoor environment (Chapter 6). We show that it is possible to preserve long temporal histories over an abstracted representation of the environment, which helps predict future mobility of the target better than previous approaches. We present a multi-robot planning algorithm that builds off of this model. Although our algorithm is designed for long-term planning and offline solution, we are able to execute the robot paths in real-time, and demonstrate extended utility with simulations. We discuss the architecture of a complete system implementation for the telepresence application, including both hardware design and software development (Chapter 8). With an increasing aging population in the U.S., it is our belief that such a system would become relevant in the near future, e.g., to assisted living facilities for purposes of healthcare monitoring.",pq_id,1731272778,proquest_dt,NA,"Karnad, Nikhil",2015,THES,Ph.D.,reviewer2,Lydia
,Service Assurance In Insecure Networks With Byzantine Adversaries .,"This dissertation describes research into security threats in new communication environments and methods to counter them. More specifically, we consider networks where some nodes perform an important application function such as routing, filtering, aggregation, etc and may become compromised while doing so. We consider three types of networks: Internet-scale publish/scribe networks, aggregating sensor networks, and peer-to-peer massively multiplayer online games (MMOG) and virtual environments. These environments are complementary to each other in many respects. A publish/scribe network is responsible for disseminating data objects produced by one set of nodes (publishers) to another set of nodes (subscribers). Subscribers want to receive those and only those objects that satisfy their interests. A large-scale publish/scribe network using many network providers, each under its own administrative control, presents numerous opportunities for mischief. In many cases the network providers will not trust one another and will not be fully trusted by the end users. A malicious network provider may insert, delete, modify, reorder, misdirect, or delay messages, and remain undetected. The first topic of our research is how to assure service integrity in such networks if some of the intermediate nodes may attack the system in an arbitrary fashion. We solve the problem by creating filtering agents corresponding to user subscriptions, and mapping these agents to either hosts from trusted providers or to clusters of hosts taken from multiple non-trusted providers. As a whole, each cluster can be trusted since only a relatively small number of providers are assumed to be malicious. A sensor network is a network connecting hundreds or thousands of sensors, tiny battery-powered computers equipped with units measuring some physical phenomena (e.g light intensity, temperature, humidity, ambient chemical composition, etc.) and wireless radio transceivers. We study aggregating sensor networks that do not fully propagate raw measurements to their users but rather perform in-network aggregation with the intent of lowering the total amount of transmitted data thus preserving bandwidth and energy. As sensor networks are frequently placed in hostile environments (for instance, in military applications) it is important to devise mechanisms guaranteeing integrity of their service under attack, and their survivability. In this dissertation we discuss CoDeX, a collect-detect-exclude framework for secure aggregation in sensor networks. Our approach to solving the problem is based on the fact that many physical phenomena exhibit strong spatial correlation. Sensor nodes can take advantage of the broadcast nature of radio transmissions, receive measurements from their neighbors, and compare them with their own results. If the values significantly differ, the fact can be reported to the user (the 'collect' phase). If a node is a subject of many such reports, it is, probably, compromised (the 'detect' phase) and should be removed from the network (the 'exclude' phase). We complement this approach with the use of randomized delivery (aggregation) trees, cryptography, and repeated aggregation of the same data in different configurations. Peer-to-peer massively multiplayer online games and virtual environments pose challenges similar to those in the other two types of networks: all three lack centralized control and run autonomously. Like pub-sub networks, P2P-based MMOGs may span the Internet and contain thousands and, potentially, hunderds of thousands of nodes. Like sensor networks, these systems almost completely rely on end nodes for providing infrastructure services. Unfortunately, most games do not provide sufficient safeguards against cheating and fraud perpetrated by the players. We developed FRAPPE, an architecture that significantly reduces this vulnerability by forming trusted 'supernodes' out of non-trusted peer machines, employing authentication, confidentiality and pseudonymity services, using secret sharing and other secure multiparty computation techniques, and constructing anonymizing tunnels to hide identities of communicating parties. We also introduce a useful primitive, called local broadcast with verification (LBV), used to solicit services of peers in a particular neighborhood and subsequently verify that the peers properly executed the protocol. Using a combination of analysis and experimental results we demonstrate that all three approaches provide strong service assurance guarantees for their respective types of networks.",pq_id,33910975,proquest_dt,NA,"Rabinovich, Paul",2008,THES,NA,reviewer2,Lydia
,Tractable Learning Of Graphical Model Structures From Data,"Probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) provide a way to represent variables (nodes) along with their conditional dependencies (edges) and therefore allow formalizing our knowledge of the interacting entities in the real world. Structure learning aims to discover the topology (and parameters) of a PGM that represents accurately a given dataset. Accuracy of representation can be measured by the likelihood that the PGM explains the observed data, which leads to maximum likelihood estimation (MLE).    From an algorithmic point of view, one challenge faced by structure learning is that the number of possible structures is super-exponential in the number of variables. From a statistical perspective, it is important to find good regularizers in order to avoid over-fitting and to achieve better generalization performance. Regularizers aim to reduce the complexity of the PGM, which can be measured by its number of parameters.    First, we present three regularizers for MLE of Gaussian Markov random fields (MRFs): local constancy for datasets where variables correspond to a measurement in a manifold (silhouettes, motion trajectories, 2D and 3D images); variable selection for finding few interacting nodes from datasets with thousands of variables; and multi-task learning for a more efficient use of data which is available for multiple related tasks.  For these regularizers, we show bounds of the eigenvalues of the optimal solution, convergence of block coordinate descent optimization, and connections to the continuous quadratic knapsack problem and the quadratic trust-region problem.    Second, we focus on learning sparse discrete MRFs through MLE. In this case, computing the objective function as well as its gradient is NP-hard. We study the convergence rate of stochastic optimization of exact NP-hard objectives, for which only biased estimates of the gradient are available. We provide a convergence-rate analysis of deterministic errors and extend our analysis to biased stochastic errors.    Third, we show general results for PGMs that allow understanding MLE with regularizers on the differences of parameters (e.g. sparse structural changes, time-varying models), the generalization ability of PGMs, and the use of PGM parameters as features in classification, dimensionality reduction and clustering. To this end, we show that the log-likelihood of several PGMs is Lipschitz continuous with respect to the parameters, and derive bounds on the Kullback-Leibler divergence, expected log-likelihood and Bayes error rate.    Finally, we formalize and study the problem of learning the structure of graphical games from strictly behavioral data. We propose MLE of a generative model defined by the Nash equilibria of the game. The formulation brings out the interplay between goodness-of-fit and model complexity: good models capture the equilibrium behavior represented in the data while controlling the true number of equilibria, including those potentially unobserved. We provide a generalization bound for MLE. We discuss several optimization algorithms including convex loss minimization, sigmoidal approximations and exhaustive search. We formally prove that games in our hypothesis space have a small true number of equilibria, with high probability; thus, convex loss minimization is sound.    We present experimental results on a wide range of real-world datasets: walking video sequences, motion capture, cardiac MRI, brain fMRI, gene expression, stock prices, world weather and congressional voting.",pq_id,1176509453,proquest_dt,NA,"Honorio Carrillo, Jean Fausto",2012,THES,Ph.D.,reviewer2,Lydia
,A Study Of Reported Satisfaction With Differentially Aggressive Computer Games Amongst Incarcerated Young Offenders.,"Investigated the satisfaction reported by young offenders following the playing of 2 interactive computer games requiring identical skills but involving differing levels of perceived aggression and planning for successful completion. Questionnaires and measures of self-esteem were administered to 72 incarcerated young offenders aged 15–18 yrs. 40 of these Ss had a record of violent offending. Ss' responses were compared to a control group of 30 young, male non-offenders. Ss were asked to play 2 short computer games, and to rate their satisfaction with both. The results indicate that the computer game which involved pattern planning to achieve success was reported as being less satisfying than that which simply required the ""destruction"" of objects. Further, between group differences were obtained on game satisfaction and self esteem scores.

,Effects Of Playing Versus Observing Violent Versus Nonviolent Video Games On Children’s Aggression.,"Examined the short-term effects of playing vs observing violent vs nonviolent video games on the aggression of 146 2nd–6th graders. Ss played or observed their violent or nonviolent games for 14 min, then completed 3 measures of aggression. The behavioral measure was an apparatus on which Ss could push buttons to hurt or help another child. Ss also completed 2 self-report measures, A. D. Leifer and D. F. Roberts's (1972) response hierarchy measure and the Rosenzweig Picture-Frustration Study. There were no differences between the violent and nonviolent conditions on the measures of aggression.

,"Favaro, P. J. (1983). The Effects Of Video Game Play On Mood, Physiological Arousal And Psychomotor Performance (Unpublished Doctoral Dissertation). Hofstra University.","The effects of computer video game play have been a controversial topic actively pursued by the media. Although psychologists, medical experts and the Surgeon General have suggested that the games cause various deleterious effects on social behavior, while others believe that the games can produce beneficial effects in the form of transfer of training, no research has been done to investigate these questions in an experimental setting. The present study examines three major questions that have been raised about video game play. The first question centers on the possible negative effects caused by playing some video games which are aggressive in theme content. The second question centers around whether or not the games produce unhealthy changes in physiological arousal. The third question focuses on whether possible benefits such as improved eye-hand coodination, can be brought on by video game play. Independent variables in this study were activity (video game play vs. television watching vs. dart game play); aggressive theme content (high vs. low); and time on task (fifteen minutes vs. one half hour). Dependent variables were mood, physiological arousal and performance ability as a function of manipulative aptitude. Subjects were 72 college undergraduates and the design was a 3 x 2 x 2 factorial design. No hypotheses were made because of the lack of experimental data on which to base theories. Data analysis was subject to a strict set of conventions designed to reduce the dangers inherent in post-hoc analyses. The major finding of the study suggested that video game play and television watching are not as similar as some have suggested. While all aggressive conditions produced increased self-reports of hostility, the high aggression video game condition produced less aggression than the low aggressive television condition. The aggressive dart game group showed highest self-reports of hostility. No effects were found for transfer to a performance task. A significant theme by time on task interaction was found for heart rate suggesting that high aggression for short time periods increased physiological arousal, which decreases under high time on task. Results of the study were used to examine catharsis, arousal and social learning models of aggression. Issues concerning the social scientist''s responsibility in the media, changes brought about by technology and future research models for studying computer games are discussed.",no_id,anderson2010_29,anderson2010,"Favaro, P.
