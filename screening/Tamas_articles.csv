,"""Choice"" And Feminist Praxis In Neoliberal Times: Autonomous Women In A Postcolonial Visual Culture","This article addresses the visual debate around a new image of the autonomous woman emerging on satellite television in West Bengal, India, a region rapidly changing under the influx of multinational finance. While this image appears to promote a revolutionary vision of choice opposing gender stratifications, it responds to the sexual anxieties of a shifting postcolonial context by reconciling women's choices with patriarchal and communalist values. To justify its ostensible ""feminist"" revolution, the imagery draws upon indigenous oppositional traditions of gender portrayal while flexibly utilizing opposition in the services of an inequitable market. Even as the neoliberal canon of (free) women and (unfree) labor is narrowcast on regional-language satellite channels throughout Bengal and its diasporas, this canon is being debated through critical embodiments of women, work, and choice in oppositional-feminist cinema. I look, on the one hand, at televisual adaptations of woman-centered works by a foremost gender-activist of the anti-colonial era, Rabindranath Tagore. The adaptive canon is read in tandem with a widely popular game show on Bengali satellite television called The Earning Homemaker. On the other hand, I consider how oppositional-feminist filmmaker Aparna Sen is undoing the prevalent canon of woman's autonomy in her recent films. My point overall is to explore how we could disentangle the oppositional from dominant neo-humanist communication patterns. I argue that we must situate various depictions of women's ""choice"" within specific relations of power, distribution, and technologies of persuasion-considering what differs and why the differences tend to be elided. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.",doi,10.1080/14680777.2011.558345,Scopus,Feminist Media Studies,De E.N.,2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,A-Eye: Automating The Role Of The Third Umpire In The Game Of Cricket,"Cricket is a sport that involves two teams, say Team A and Team B, and two field umpires. Initially, Team A bats to score some runs, while Team B balls. Then, Team A balls and Team B bats to overcome the score of Team A. If this happens, then Team B wins. Otherwise, Team A wins. The balling team can dismiss a batsman from scoring through a Run-Out, i.e.; the batsman fails to enter an area before three stumps are dislodged in that area. In this case, a third umpire makes the 'Run-Out/Not-Out' decision through video technology. This process can consume around one minute which disrupts the pace of the game. In this paper, we propose and validate a novel technology called A-Eye, which automates the role of the third umpire. By applying A-Eye to a set of autonomously-filmed Run-Out videos, we show that it is efficient as compared to the third umpire, and almost as accurate. Also, it can be used to estimate a rating for the field umpires. These results have been recognized internationally, and have convinced our local cricket council to employ A-Eye within a professional cricket tournament. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

,A Computer Program For Studying Blood Gases In Respiratory Care,"We developed a computer program in a style of a game to help study blood gases in respiratory care. The program generates five simulated patients from a pool of 11. The player selects one patient, then the program calculates the patient's condition according to initial condition and selected treatment. Condition of the simulated patient may improve or deteriorate accordingly. Every two hours, the program display the data, requests the diagnosis and asks addition/change of treatment. The program then judges if diagnosis is correct. This process is repeated up to 48 hours. Finally a score and comments are displayed according to the performance of the patient and of the player. Students and young physicians used the original disk 312 times and more than 30 copies are distributed throughout the country. It is useful by itself as a self-teaching tool, but even more useful when combined with verbal teaching by instructors. © 1987 Japanese Society of Anesthesiologists.",doi,10.1007/s0054070010155,Scopus,Journal of Anesthesia,Suwa K.,1987,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,A Computerized Test Battery For The Assessment Of Cardiovascular Reactivity,"Recent evidence has suggested a possible relationship between the tendency to exhibit excessive cardiovascular reactions during psychological challenge and the risk of cardiovascular disease. Valid techniques for reliably assessing such reactions are, however, minimally available. A test battery for the assessment of cardiovascular reactivity to experimental challenge is currently being developed at the University of Pittsburgh in conjunction with the University of Miami and Duke University. An IBM-AT compatible microcomputer is being used for the concurrent collection of physiological data and presentation of the laboratory stressors. Digitized cardiovascular data being collected include EKG, Impedance Cardiogram (ICG), phonocardiogram, and a peripheral pulse wave measure. Blood pressure readings are also being collected and stored on disk. The computer presents three challenging video games, each designed to elicit cardiovascular reactions. Processing programs are being used and developed for the standardized scoring of the digitized signals. To assist in epidemiological research a mobile testing unit has been assembled for the easy administration of the test battery in varying geographical locations. The test battery being developed will increase the feasibility of epidemiological and clinical assessment of stress-induced cardiovascular responses which may substantiate a link between reactivity and cardiovascular disease. © 1991.",doi,10.1016/0020-7101(91)90068-P,Scopus,International Journal of Bio-Medical Computing,"Debski T.T., Kamarck T.W., Richard Jennings J., Young L.W., Eddy M.J., Zhang Y.",1991,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,A Conceptual Affective Design Framework For The Use Of Emotions In Computer Game Design,"The purpose of this strategy of inquiry is to understand how emotions influence gameplay and to review contemporary techniques to design for them in the aim of devising a model that brings current disparate parts of the game design process together. Emotions sit at the heart of a game player’s level of engagement. They are evoked across many of the components that facilitate gameplay including the interface, the player’s avatar, non-player characters and narrative. Understanding the role of emotion in creating truly immersive and believable environments is critical for game designers. After discussing a taxonomy of emotion, this paper will present a systematic literature review of designing for emotion in computer games. Following this, a conceptual framework for affective design is offered as a guide for the future of computer game design. © 2007-2015 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.",doi,10.5817/CP2015-3-4,Scopus,Cyberpsychology,de Byl P.,2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,A Game-Theoretic Approach For Elastic Distributed Data Stream Processing,"Distributed data stream processing applications are structured as graphs of interconnected modules able to ingest high-speed data and to transform them in order to generate results of interest. Elasticity is one of the most appealing features of stream processing applications. Itmakes it possible to scale up/down the allocated computing resources on demand in response to fluctuations of the workload. On clouds, this represents a necessary feature to keep the operating cost at affordable levels while accommodating user-defined QoS requirements. In this article, we study this problem from a game-theoretic perspective. The control logic driving elasticity is distributed among local control agents capable of choosing the right amount of resources to use by each module. In a first step, we model the problem as a noncooperative game in which agents pursue their self-interest. We identify the Nash equilibria and we design a distributed procedure to reach the best equilibrium in the Pareto sense. As a second step, we extend the noncooperative formulation with a decentralized incentive-based mechanism in order to promote cooperation by moving the agreement point closer to the system optimum. Simulations confirm the results of our theoretical analysis and the quality of our strategies. © 2016 ACM.",doi,10.1145/2903146,Scopus,ACM Transactions on Autonomous and Adaptive Systems,Mencagli G.,2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,A Game Theoretical Approach To Distributed Relay Selection In Randomized Cooperation,"In this paper, the problem of node management in the presence of randomized cooperation is tackled. First, game theory is exploited to model the problem of setting up a cluster of cooperative nodes in a wireless network as a multiplayer noncooperative game. In this game the set of players is made of all the nodes belonging to a potential relay cluster an d the set of actions for each player consists of two options only (characterized by different payoffs), namely transmitting a data packet or remaining silent. Then, a novel strategy for the management of node participation to a distributed cooperative link is derived. The proposed solution is fully distributed, is characterized by autonomous choices made by each potential relay and is of significant practical interest since it guarantees the participation of a proper number of nodes to a virtual antenna array (so avoiding an energy waste associated with an excessive number of cooperating nodes) without requiring any overhead for node management. © 2010 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TWC.2010.061810.091394,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications,"Sergi S., Vitetta G.M.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,A Game Theoretical Based System Using Holt-Winters And Genetic Algorithm With Fuzzy Logic For Dos/Ddos Mitigation On Sdn Networks,"The ever expanding the usage of cloud computing environments, connected applications and Internet of Things-based devices have progressively increased the amount of data that travels through our networks. Software-defined network (SDN) is an emergent paradigm that aims to support next-generation networks through its flexible and powerful management mechanisms. One of the biggest threats faced by these services nowadays is security management. Attacks based on the denial of service (DoS) are particularly efficient against this paradigm due to its centralized control characteristic. Once this controlling system receives a massive amount of malicious requests, the overall performance of the network operation is impaired. Although several researches propose to address this problem, most of them are reactive approaches, detecting the attacks and warning the network administrators, i.e., after the network is already compromised. This paper presents an autonomic DoS/DDoS defensive approach for SDNs called Game Theory (GT)-Holt-Winters for Digital Signature (HWDS), which unites the anomaly detection and identification provided by an HWDS system with an autonomous decision-making model based on GT. Real collected data and simulated attacks are used by the system to measure its effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, we also use a heuristic Fuzzy-GADS method for anomaly detection instead of HWDS, aiming to compare the achieved performance and evaluate the behavior of the presented game theoretical approaches a standalone mitigation module. © 2017 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2702341,Scopus,IEEE Access,"De Assis M.V.O., Hamamoto A.H., Abrao T., Proenca M.L.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,A Land Surface Model Incorporated With Soil Freeze/Thaw And Its Application In Game/Tibet,"Land surface process is of great importance in global climate change, moisture and heat exchange in the interface of the earth and atmosphere, human impacts on the environment and ecosystem, etc. Soil freeze/thaw plays an important role in cold land surface processes. In this work the diurnal freeze/thaw effects on energy partition in the context of GAME/ Tibet are studied. A sophisticated land surface model is developed, the particular aspect of which is its physical consideration of soil freeze/ thaw and vapor flux. The simultaneous water and heat transfer soil sub-model not only reflects the water flow from unfrozen zone to frozen fringe in freezing/thawing soil, but also demonstrates the change of moisture and temperature field induced by vapor flux from high temperature zone to low temperature zone, which makes the model applicable for various circumstances. The modified Picard numerical method is employed to help with the water balance and convergence of the numerical scheme. Finally, the model is applied to analyze the diurnal energy and water cycle characteristics over the Tibetan Plateau using the Game/Tibet datasets observed in May and July of 1998. Heat and energy transfer simulation shows that: (i) There exists a negative feedback mechanism between soil freeze/thaw and soil temperature/ground heat flux; (ii) during freezing period all three heat fluxes do not vary apparently, in spite of the fact that the negative soil temperature is higher than that not considering soil freeze; (iii) during thawing period, ground heat flux increases, and sensible heat flux decreases, but latent heat flux does not change much; and (iv) during freezing period, soil temperature decreases, though ground heat flux increases. © Science in China Press 2006.",doi,10.1007/s11430-006-2028-3,Scopus,"Science in China, Series D: Earth Sciences","Hu H., Ye B., Zhou Y., Tian F.",2006,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,A Machine Consciousness Approach To The Design Of Human-Like Bots,"This chapter introduces Machine Consciousness as a new research field applied to the development of human-like behaviour of non-player characters (NPCs) in video games. Key aspects, advantages, and challenges of this young research area are discussed using the cognitive architecture CERA-CRANIUM as an illustrative example of an autonomous control system inspired by cognitive theories of human consciousness. Additionally, other cognitive architectures used in video games are also analyzed. The bot codenamed CC-Bot2, winner of the 2K BotPrize 2010 competition and based on the CERA-CRANIUM cognitive architecture, is also described in this chapter. Specifically, the particular way in which CC-Bot2 processes the sensory-motor information and generates sequences of adaptive human-like actions is discussed. We also analyze the main differences between CC-Bot2 and other bots, focusing on the key features that allowed CC-Bot2 to win first place in the competition. Finally, we conclude by describing the main lines of work for future CC-Bot implementations and pointing out major conclusions about the application of Machine Consciousness to the design of believable bots. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

,A Metacognitive Strategy For Reducing Disruptive Behavior In Children With Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders: Gofar Pilot,"BACKGROUND: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are often characterized by disruptive behavior problems and there are few effective interventions available. GoFAR is a novel, 3-part intervention designed to improve self-regulation and adaptive living skills of children with FASD by improving metacognitive control of emotions and arousal.METHODS: The intervention has 3 components: (i) GoFAR: a ""serious game"" designed to teach a metacognitive control strategy in a computer game environment; (ii) parent training on child behavioral regulation; and (iii) Behavior Analog Therapy (BAT) sessions, a practical application of the metacognitive learning methodology by parent and child in the context of learning adaptive skills. The learning strategy (FAR) teaches the child to Focus and make a plan, Act out the plan, and Reflect back on the plan. Thirty families were randomized to 3 groups: (i) GoFAR (n = 10); (ii) FACELAND (n = 10); or (iii) CONTROL (n = 10). The 2 intervention groups, GoFAR and FACELAND, used computer games to instruct children. Both groups also received 5 sessions of parent training followed by 5 sessions of joint parent/child therapy (BAT). Assessment of disruptive behavior, including frequency of temper tantrums, frustration tolerance, impulsivity, destructiveness, aggression, and maintaining attention were carried out before enrollment at Mid-Treatment, when game play and parent training were completed, and finally, after completing the BAT sessions.RESULTS: Parental report of disruptive behavior overall was significantly reduced in the GoFAR group after the first components, game play and parent training, and after the BAT sessions in the FACELAND group with no changes in the CONTROL group over time.CONCLUSIONS: The GoFAR(®) game was well received by children and effective in teaching the required skills. Mastering the FAR metacognitive strategy was associated with a reduction in disruptive behaviors in children with FASD suggesting that effective interventions can improve outcomes for this high-risk group.

,A Motivational Model Of Video Game Engagement,"More Americans now play video games than go to the movies (NPD Group, 2009). The meteoric rise in popularity of video games highlights the need for research approaches that can deepen our scientific understanding of video game engagement. This article advances a theory-based motivational model for examining and evaluating the ways by which video game engagement shapes psychological processes and influences well-being. Rooted in self-determination theory (Deci & Ryan, 2000; Ryan & Deci, 2000a), our approach suggests that both the appeal and well-being effects of video games are based in their potential to satisfy basic psychological needs for competence, autonomy, and relatedness. We review recent empirical evidence applying this perspective to a number of topics including need satisfaction in games and short-term well-being, the motivational appeal of violent game content, motivational sources of postplay aggression, the antecedents and consequences of disordered patterns of game engagement, and the determinants and effects of immersion. Implications of this model for the future study of game motivation and the use of video games in interventions are discussed. © 2010 American Psychological Association.",doi,10.1037/a0019440,Scopus,Review of General Psychology,"Przybylski A.K., Rigby C.S., Ryan R.M.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,A Multi-Agent Architecture For Geosimulation Of Moving Agents,"In this paper, a novel architecture is proposed in which an axiomatic derivation system in the form of first-order logic facilitates declarative explanation and spatial reasoning. Simulation of environmental perception and interaction between autonomous agents is designed with a geographic belief–desire–intention and a request–inform–query model. The architecture has a complementary quantitative component that supports collaborative planning based on the concept of equilibrium and game theory. This new architecture presents a departure from current best practices geographic agent-based modelling.

,A Multi-Measure Approach For Connecting Cognitive Workload And Automation,"Eye behavior metrics, time of run, and subjective survey results were assessed during human-computer interaction with high, low, and intermediate system autonomy levels. The results of this study are provided as a contribution to knowledge on the relationship between cognitive workload physiology and automation. Research suggests that changes in eye behavior metrics are related to changes in cognitive workload. Few studies have investigated the relationship between eye behavior metrics physiology measures and levels of automation. A within-subjects experiment involving 18 participants who played an open-source real-time strategy game was conducted. Three different versions of the game were developed, each with a unique static autonomy level designed from Sheridan and Verplank's 10 levels of autonomy (levels 2, 4, and 9). NASA-TLX subject survey ratings, time to complete run, and visual fixation rate were found to be significantly different among automation levels. These findings suggest that assessing visual physiology may be a promising indicator for evaluating cognitive workload when interacting with static autonomy levels. This efforts takes us one step closer to using visual physiology as a useful method for evaluating operator workload in almost real-time. Relevance to industry Potential applications of this research include development of software that integrates adaptive automation to improve human-computer task performance for high cognitive workload tasks (Air Traffic Control, aircraft piloting, process control, information analyst, etc.). © 2016",doi,10.1016/j.ijhcs.2016.05.008,Scopus,International Journal of Human Computer Studies,"Evans D.C., Fendley M.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,A New Rfid-Based And Ontological Recreation System For Blind People,"More than five million people are blind in China. Computer game should be attractive to them for leisure time, especially Mahjong. Ontology theory has been adopted to retrieve its knowledge and the low-cost RFID as the mediation between the blind player and computer. We designed an autonomous computer platform called Blind Mahjong Game (BMG), which includes 144 Mahjong tiles and voice prompt function. BMG comprises a plurality of Mahjong cubes (stuck RFID tag) their location in the Mahjong-selection tray or Mahjong-discard tray, a plurality of Chow-Pong-Kong-Win indicator cubes, a win frame, a tile frame, at least one RFID reader connected to BMG by USB port gateway to transmit an RF signal. As compared to current static or drab game for the blind, BMG has been certified by two patents in Taiwan which have shown that its software and hardware integrated novelty, progress and utilisation in the application of RFID technology for the blind.

,A Preliminary Study On Pupil Size Changes Detection On Mental Stress With Mental Stressor,"This is a study on measuring the effect of stress that stimulated by the different difficulty of game level on pupil dilation. Playing games are claimed a method to distress in the community, however, this activity is enhancing stress level? The effect of the game playing on the changes of pupil dilation is unknown. An investigation was conducted on relating the changes of pupil diameter measurement at the different difficulty levels of the game. A simple tool was developed by using a webcam as image acquisition device together with MATLAB Image Processing Tool to analyze the acquired images. Here, experiments on the pupil detection algorithm, which consisted of four different methods are to work alternatively with one another and to provide higher chances of pupil detection. 10 subjects were involved in the experiments, which they were requested to play a selected game with four different ascending increased in difficulties, meanwhile, pupil size changes were measured simultaneously. The selected game served as a stress stimulus to the subjects. The result showed a positive proportional relationship between increased in game difficulty levels and pupil dilation. The investigation reported that the pupil dilated when the difficulty of game level increased. Limitation of this study is the sample size on the prototype testing should be increased to concrete the outcome. © 2017 National Taiwan University.",doi,10.4015/S1016237217500119,Scopus,"Biomedical Engineering - Applications, Basis and Communications","Lee P.F., Lee K.S.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,A Robot Learns The Facial Expressions Recognition And Face/Non-Face Discrimination Through An Imitation Game,"In this paper, we show that a robotic system can learn online to recognize facial expressions without having a teaching signal associating a facial expression with a given abstract label (e.g., ‘sadness’, ‘happiness’). Moreover, we show that recognizing a face from a non-face can be accomplished autonomously if we imagine that learning to recognize a face occurs after learning to recognize a facial expression, and not the opposite, as it is classically considered. In these experiments, the robot is considered as a baby because we want to understand how the baby can develop some abilities autonomously. We model, test and analyze cognitive abilities through robotic experiments. Our starting point was a mathematical model showing that, if the baby uses a sensory motor architecture for the recognition of a facial expression, then the parents must imitate the baby’s facial expression to allow the online learning. Here, a first series of robotic experiments shows that a simple neural network model can control a robot head and can learn online to recognize the facial expressions of the human partner if he/she imitates the robot’s prototypical facial expressions (the system is not using a model of the face nor a framing system). A second architecture using the rhythm of the interaction first allows a robust learning of the facial expressions without face tracking and next performs the learning involved in face recognition. Our more striking conclusion is that, for infants, learning to recognize a face could be more complex than recognizing a facial expression. Consequently, we emphasize the importance of the emotional resonance as a mechanism to ensure the dynamical coupling between individuals, allowing the learning of increasingly complex tasks. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",doi,10.1007/s12369-014-0245-z,Scopus,International Journal of Social Robotics,"Boucenna S., Gaussier P., Andry P., Hafemeister L.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,A Vr-Based Serious Game For Studying Emotional Regulation In Adolescents,"People all use more or less adapted strategies to confront adverse emotional situations in their lives without being psychologically affected. The emotional regulation (ER) strategies that we use determine the way in which we feel, express, and behave. Moreover, ER strategies are particularly important in adolescents, a population for which ER strategy deficits can be linked to the appearance of numerous mental health disorders, such as depression or anxiety, or disruptive behaviors. Thus, the early detection of dysfunctional ER strategies and training in adaptive ER strategies can help prevent future occurrences of possible behavioral and psychosocial disorders. In this article, the authors present the GameTeen System (GT-System), a novel instrument based on virtual reality and serious games for the assessment and training of ER strategies in adolescents. The results of their preliminary evaluation suggest that this system can effectively train and evaluate emotional regulation strategies in adolescents. © 1981-2012 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/MCG.2015.8,Scopus,IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications,"Rodriguez A., Rey B., Vara M.D., Wrzesien M., Alcaniz M., Banos R.M., Perez-Lopez D.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Abnormal Activity In Reward Brain Circuits In Human Narcolepsy With Cataplexy,"Objective: Hypothalamic hypocretins (or orexins) regulate energy metabolism and arousal maintenance. Recent animal research suggests that hypocretins may also influence reward-related behaviors. In humans, the loss of hypocretin-containing neurons results in a major sleep-wake disorder called narcolepsy-cataplexy, which is associated with emotional disturbances. Here, we aim to test whether narcoleptic patients show an abnormal pattern of brain activity during reward processing. Methods: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging in 12 unmedicated patients with narcolepsy-cataplexy to measure the neural responses to expectancy and experience of monetary gains and losses. We statistically compared the patients' data with those obtained in a group of 12 healthy matched controls. Results and Interpretation: Our results reveal that activity in the dopaminergic ventral midbrain (ventral tegmental area) was not modulated in narcolepsy-cataplexy patients during high reward expectancy (unlike controls), and that ventral striatum activity was reduced during winning. By contrast, the patients showed abnormal activity increases in the amygdala and in dorsal striatum for positive outcomes. In addition, we found that activity in the nucleus accumbens and the ventral-medial prefrontal cortex correlated with disease duration, suggesting that an alternate neural circuit could be privileged over the years to control affective responses to emotional challenges and compensate for the lack of influence from ventral midbrain regions. Our study offers a detailed picture of the distributed brain network involved during distinct stages of reward processing and shows for the first time, to our knowledge, how this network is affected in hypocretin-deficient narcoleptic patients. © 2010 American Neurological Association.",doi,10.1002/ana.21825,Scopus,Annals of Neurology,"Ponz A., Khatami R., Poryazova R., Werth E., Boesiger P., Bassetti C.L., Schwartz S.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Active Video Games As An Exercise Tool For Children With Cystic Fibrosis,"Background: Active video games are used in many hospitals as exercise tools for children with cystic fibrosis. However, the exercise intensity associated with playing these games has not been examined in this population. Methods: Children with cystic fibrosis [n=30, aged 12.3 (2.6) years, 17 boys, BMI 17.7 (2.8) kg/m2] were recruited from outpatient clinics in Dublin hospitals. Age and gender matched control children were recruited from local schools. Oxygen consumption, metabolic equivalents (METs) calculated from resting V̇O2, and heart rate were measured while playing Nintendo Wii™ (Nintendo Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) Sports Boxing and Nintendo Wii Fit Free Jogging using a portable indirect calorimeter (Oxycon Mobile). Results: Playing Wii Boxing resulted in light intensity activity (2.46. METs) while playing Wii Fit Free Jogging resulted in moderate intensity physical activity (4.44. METs). No significant difference was seen between groups in the energy cost of playing active video games. Conclusion: Active video games are a useful source of light to moderate intensity physical activity in children with cystic fibrosis. © 2013 European Cystic Fibrosis Society.",doi,10.1016/j.jcf.2013.10.008,Scopus,Journal of Cystic Fibrosis,"O'Donovan C., Greally P., Canny G., McNally P., Hussey J.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Active Video Gaming In Patients With Renal Transplant: A Pilot Study.,"Patients with renal transplant are at higher risk of mortality from cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared with the general population. Physical activity has been shown to reduce the risk of CVD mortality in these patients. Unfortunately, barriers such as the harsh Canadian climate prevent patients from engaging in and harvesting the health benefits of physical activity. This pilot study explored active video gaming (AVG) as a way for patients with renal transplant to obtain physical activity and examined its effect on their functional status and quality of life (QOL). We recruited nine patients for an 8-week prospective pilot study. All patients received a Microsoft Xbox 360™ video gaming console, a Microsoft Kinect™ sensor, and the video game Your Shape Fitness Evolved 2012. Assessment of each participant before and after the intervention included blood pressure measures, a 6-minute walk test, and the Godin Leisure Time Questionnaire (GLTQ). We analyzed all nine patients at the end of the 8-week study period, and found no changes in blood pressure or GLTQ scores. However, there was a significant increase in the 6-minute walk distance (P = 0.022), which represented a consistent increase for most patients (correlation = 0.977). In addition, participants over the age of 45 years (n = 4) were more likely to use the AVG system (P = 0.042). AVG has the potential to improve the functional status in patients with renal transplant. Further research is required to corroborate the full health benefits of AVG in this patient population.",doi,10.1186/2047-1440-3-15,pubmed,Transplantation research,"Wang, Dorothy Wei Yun; Sills, Laura L; MacDonald, Sara B; Maianski, Ziv; Alwayn, Ian",2014,NA,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Acute Cognitively Engaging Exergame-Based Physical Activity Enhances Executive Functions In Adolescents,"The study aimed to elucidate the influence of cognitive engagement comprised in an acute bout of exergame-based physical activity on executive functions (inhibition, cognitive flexibility) in adolescents. Therefore, the level of cognitive engagement and the intensity of physical activity were systematically varied across three experimental conditions. Sixty-five healthy male adolescents (13-16 years) were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (a) physical activity with high levels of cognitive engagement during active video gaming, (b) physical activity with low levels of cognitive engagement during active video gaming, (c) sedentary with low levels of cognitive engagement during passive video watching. Manipulation checks, including subjective and objective operationalizations of cognitive engagement, were applied. Executive functions were assessed before and after each condition using the D-KEFS design fluency test. Results showed that cognitive engagement, operationalized by subjects' ratings and heart rate variability, differed between conditions. The physical activity condition with a high level of cognitive engagement resulted in significantly better performance in cognitive flexibility compared to conditions with low levels of cognitive engagement. Regarding benefits for executive functions in male adolescents, the results indicate that acute physical activity with high cognitive engagement could be more efficient than physical activity of the same intensity with low cognitive engagement. Even though further evidence is needed, these results extend previous research and suggest a methodological approach for measuring cognitive engagement. © 2016 Benzing et al.

,Acute Stress Increases Sex Differences In Risk Seeking In The Balloon Analogue Risk Task,"Background: Decisions involving risk often must be made under stressful circumstances. Research on behavioral and brain differences in stress responses suggest that stress might have different effects on risk taking in males and females. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study, participants played a computer game designed to measure risk taking (the Balloon Analogue Risk Task) fifteen minutes after completing a stress challenge or control task. Stress increased risk taking among men but decreased it among women. Conclusions/Significance: Acute stress amplifies sex differences in risk seeking; making women more risk avoidant and men more risk seeking. Evolutionary principles may explain these stress-induced sex differences in risk taking behavior. © 2009 Lighthall et al.",doi,10.1371/journal.pone.0006002,Scopus,PLoS ONE,"Lighthall N.R., Mather M., Gorlick M.A.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Adaptive Tele-Therapies Based On Serious Games For Health For People With Time-Management And Organisational Problems: Preliminary Results,"Attention Deficit with Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is one of the most prevalent disorders within the child population today. Inattention problems can lead to greater difficulties in completing assignments, as well as problems with time management and prioritisation of tasks. This article presents an intelligent tele-therapy tool based on Serious Games for Health, aimed at the improvement of time management skills and the prioritisation of tasks. This tele-system is based on the use of decision trees within Django, a high-level Python Web framework. The technologies and techniques used were selected so as to boost user involvement and to enable the system to be easily customised. This article shows the preliminary results of the pilot-phase in an experiment performed to evaluate the use of adaptive tele-therapies within a group of typically developing children and adolescents aged between 12 and 19 years old without ADHD. To do so, we relied on the collection of parameters and the conduct of surveys for assessing time management skills, as well as measuring system usability and availability. The results of a time management survey highlighted that the users involved in the trial did not use any specific or effective time management techniques, scoring 1.98 and 2.30 out of 5 points in this area for ages under 15 and over 16 years old, respectively. The final calculations based on the usability questionnaire resulted in an average score of 78.75 out of 100. The creation of a customisable tool capable of working with different skills, in conjunction with the replication of the current study, may help to understand these users' needs, as well as boosting time management skills among teenagers with and without ADHD. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",doi,10.3390/ijerph110100749,Scopus,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"Frutos-Pascual M., Zapirain B.G., Zorrilla A.M.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Adolescent Girls' Energy Expenditure During Dance Simulation Active Computer Gaming,"Abstract The objective of this study was to determine the energy expended and intensity of physical activity achieved by adolescent girls while playing on a dance simulation game. Twenty adolescent girls were recruited from a local secondary school. Resting oxygen uptake V̇O2 and heart rate were analysed while sitting quietly and subsequently during ~30 min of game play, with 10 min at each of three increasing levels of difficulty. Energy expenditure was predicted from V̇O2 at rest and during game play at three levels of play, from which the metabolic equivalents (METS) of game playing were derived. Mean ± standard deviation energy expenditure for levels 1, 2, and 3 was 3.63 ± 0.58, 3.65 ± 0.54, and 4.14 ± 0.71 kcal min-1 respectively, while mean activity for each level of play was at least of moderate intensity (&gt; 3 METS). Dance simulation active computer games provide an opportunity for most adolescent girls to exercise at moderate intensity. Therefore, regular playing might contribute to daily physical activity recommendations for good health in this at-risk population. © 2010 Taylor &amp; Francis.",doi,10.1080/02640410903369935,Scopus,Journal of Sports Sciences,"Fawkner S.G., Niven A., Thin A.G., MacDonald M.J., Oakes J.R.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Adult Attachment Style Modulates Neural Responses In A Mentalizing Task,"Adult attachment style (AAS) is a personality trait that affects social cognition. Behavioral data suggest that AAS influences mentalizing proficiency, i.e. the ability to predict and explain people's behavior with reference to mental states, but the neural correlates are unknown. We here tested how the AAS dimensions ""avoidance"" (AV) and ""anxiety"" (ANX) modulate neural correlates of mentalizing.We measured brain activation using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 164 healthy subjects during an interactive mentalizing paradigm (Prisoner's Dilemma Game). AAS was assessed with the Relationship Scales Questionnaire, including the subscales AV and ANX.Our task elicited a strong activation of the mentalizing network, including bilateral precuneus, (anterior, middle, and posterior) cingulate cortices, temporal poles, inferior frontal gyri (IFG), temporoparietal junctions, superior medial frontal gyri as well as right medial orbital frontal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus (MFG), and amygdala. We found that AV is positively and ANX negatively correlated with task-associated neural activity in the right amygdala, MFG, midcingulate cortex, and superior parietal lobule, and in bilateral IFG. These data suggest that avoidantly attached adults activate brain areas implicated in emotion regulation and cognitive control to a larger extent than anxiously attached individuals during mentalizing. © 2015 IBRO.

,"Aerobic Expenditure During A Tennis Match [Dépense Énergétique Aérobie Au Cours D'un Match De Tennis, Du Laboratoire Au Terrain]","Aim - Measure the oxygen consumption (V̇O2) during a tennis match and to verify whether the heart rate (HR) measured on the field allows to estimate this V̇O2. Maximal oxygen consumption and anaerobic threshold were determined in ten players. Materials and methods - Then each subject played a match for approximately two hours. Ventilatory flow, oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations and heart rate (HR) were measured continuously and oxygen consumption was determined with a portable telemetric ergospirometry system. A video camera was set simultaneously to film the player. Results - Mean V̇O2 reached approximately 60% of the V̇O2 max for 80% of the duration of the match. During the points, HR varied from 70 to 95% of maxHR and decreased rapidly during the changes of side. The evolution of the V̇O2 was similar. The mean V̇O2 was identical to that estimated from the HR measured in the field and the HR/V̇O2 relationship determined at the laboratory. Conclusion - Despite the intermittent nature of the game, tennis induces a moderate but long aerobic expenditure and the HR measured in the field remains a good indicator of the level of the aerobic expenditure. © 2001 éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.",doi,10.1016/S0765-1597(00)00040-X,Scopus,Science and Sports,"Dansou P., Oddou M.F., Delaire M., Therminarias A.",2001,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Affect-Based Adaptation Of An Applied Video Game For Educational Purposes,"Purpose: This paper aims to clarify how affect-based adaptation can improve implicit recognition of playing style of individuals during game sessions. This study presents the “Rush for Gold” game using dynamic difficulty adjustment of tasks based on both player performance and affectation inferred through electrodermal activity and facial expressions of the player. The game applies linear regression for calculating playing styles to be applied for achieving a style-based adaptation in other educational video games. Design/methodology/approach: The experimental procedure included subject selection, demonstration, informed consent procedure, two game sessions in random order – one without and another with affective adaptation control – and post-game self-report. The experiment was conducted with participation of 30 master students and university lecturers in informatics. Findings: This study presents experimental results concerning the impact of affective adaptation over playing style recognition, game session time, task’s effectiveness, efficiency and difficulty and, as well, player’s assessment of affectively adaptive gameplay obtained by an adaptation control panel embedded into the game and by post-game self-report. Research limitations/implications: The proposed adaptive game limits recognised styles to such based on the Kolb’s Learning Style Inventory model. Another limitation of the study is the relatively small number of participants constrained by the extended experimental procedure and the desktop game version. Originality/value: The paper presents an original research on the effect of affect-based adaptation on a novel approach for implicit recognition of playing styles. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",doi,10.1108/ITSE-07-2016-0023,Scopus,Interactive Technology and Smart Education,"Bontchev B., Vassileva D.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,"Affect And The Computer Game Player: The Effect Of Gender, Personality, And Game Reinforcement Structure On Affective Responses To Computer Game-Play","Previous research on computer games has tended to concentrate on their more negative effects (e.g., addiction, increased aggression). This study departs from the traditional clinical and social learning explanations for these behavioral phenomena and examines the effect of personality, in-game reinforcement characteristics, gender, and skill on the emotional state of the game-player. Results demonstrated that in-game reinforcement characteristics and skill significantly effect a number of affective measures (most notably excitement and frustration). The implications of the impact of game-play on affect are discussed with reference to the concepts of ""addiction"" and ""aggression."" © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",doi,10.1089/cpb.2006.9.308,Scopus,Cyberpsychology and Behavior,"Chumbley J., Griffiths M.",2006,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Affective Educational Games And The Evolving Teaching Experience,"Teaching methods must adapt to learners' expectations. Computer game-based learning environments enable learning through experimentation and are inherently motivational. However, for identifying when learners achieve learning goals and providing suitable feedback, Intelligent Tutoring Systems must be used. Recognizing the learner's affective state enables educational games to improve the learner's experience or to distinguish relevant emotions. This chapter discusses the creation of an affective student model that infers the learner's emotions from cognitive and motivational variables through observable behavior. The control-value theory of 'achievement emotions' provides a basis for this work. A Probabilistic Relational Models (PRMs) approach for affective student modeling, which is based on Dynamic Bayesian Networks, is discussed. The approach is tested through a prototyping study based on Wizard-of-Oz experiments and preliminary results are presented. The affective student model will be incorporated into PlayPhysics, an emotional game-based learning environment for teaching Physics. PRMs facilitate the design of student models with Bayesian Networks. The effectiveness of PlayPhysics will be evaluated by comparing the students' learning gains and learning efficiencies. © 2011, IGI Global.",doi,10.4018/978-1-60960-569-8.ch013,Scopus,Computer Games as Educational and Management Tools: Uses and Approaches,"Muñoz K., Mc Kevitt P., Lunney T., Noguez J., Neri L.",2011,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Affective Games: How Iopiates Elicit An Emotional Fix,"Video-games, like movies, music and storybooks are emotional artifacts. We buy media to alter our affective state. Through consumption they impact our physiology and thus alter our affective world. In this chapter the authors review the ways in which playing games can elicit emotion. This chapter will discuss the increased power of video-game technology to elicit affect, and show how the mash-up of traditional and interactive techniques have delivered a richness of emotion that competes with film and television. They then conclude by looking forward to a time when video-games become the dominant medium, and the preferred choice when seeking that emotional fix. © 2011, IGI Global.",doi,10.4018/978-1-61692-892-6.ch016,Scopus,"Affective Computing and Interaction: Psychological, Cognitive and Neuroscientific Perspectives",Sykes J.,2010,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Affective Learning Analysis Of Children In A Card Sorting Game,The purpose of this paper is to provide an affective learning analysis on children while they were playing a card sorting game. The electroencephalogram (EEG) signals of 8 preschoolers aged between 4 to 6 years were collected (a) while they were playing a card sorting game; and (b) observing affective faces. The features from EEG signals were extracted using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE). The Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) was used to classify and generate the affective maps of the EEG signals while the children were playing the game. The initial results show that the children’s affective states are unique and there might be different affects that drive a child’s performance. This analysis shows the potential of using the affective learning analysis approach in assessing educational tools such as computer games. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.,doi,10.1007/978-3-662-46578-3_80,Scopus,Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering,"Othman M., Wahab A., Qayoom A., Hamzah M.S., Seman M.S.A.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Affective Moderators Of The Cardiovascular Response To Stress In Offspring Of Hypertensives,"The present study examined the influence of trait anxiety on the cardiovascular responses of normotensive offspring of hypertensives and normotensives. Forty-eight young adult males, half of whom were offspring of hypertensives (PH+), were exposed to an extended active coping stressor. This was a 1 hr shock avoidance procedure with avoidance made contingent on video-game performance. Trait anxiety status interacted with parental history of hypertension in predicting cardiovascular response. PH+ subjects who scored high on trait anxiety exhibited greater elevations of heart rate and forearm blood flow, and decreases in forearm vascular resistance than did PH+/low trait anxiety subjects or offspring of normotensives (PH-). Cardiovascular responses of PH+/low trait anxiety subjects did not differ significantly from those of PH- subjects. Results suggest affective factors may moderate cardiovascular responses of individuals at risk for hypertension. © 1992.",doi,10.1016/0022-3999(92)90023-U,Scopus,Journal of Psychosomatic Research,Miller S.B.,1992,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Aggression And Psychopathology In Adolescents With A Preference For Violent Electronic Games,"Associations between a preference for violent electronic games and adolescents' self-perceptions of problem behaviors and emotions were examined. It was predicted that a preference for violent games would be associated with negative externalizing characteristics, in particular aggressive emotions and behaviors, on the Youth Self-Report (YSR), a standardized self-report measure of adolescent problem behaviors. Thirty-two 11- through 15-year-olds (17 girls) listed and categorized favorite electronic games into one of six predetermined categories and completed the YSR. MANOVA revealed significant relationships between a preference for violent games and the Thought Problems subscale (P < .01) and YSR Total Score (P < .05), with trends noted for the Internalizing (P < .06) and Anxious-Depressed (P < .08) subscales. Expected relationships with externalizing behaviors, including aggression, were not found. However, across all YSR subscales, children with higher preference for violent games had more clinically significant elevations than those with low preference for violent games. On the Total Problems subscale, of the eight children receiving scores in the clinically significant range, six were in the High preference group (three boys and three girls). The failure to find the expected relationships between a preference for violent games and aggressive, externalizing behaviors is puzzling. It is possible that individuals with a preference for violent games may have high exposure to all forms of media violence. Their perceptions of their own behavior, in comparison, may not seem sufficiently aggressive to justify endorsement of problems in this area. Or, playing violent electronic games may promote a disconnection between the emotions normally associated with violence and violent acts. These explanations are consistent with a desensitization model where exposure to media violence decreases sensitivity to aggression. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",doi,10.1002/ab.90015,Scopus,Aggressive Behavior,"Funk J.B., Hagan J., Schimming J., Bullock W.A., Buchman D.D., Myers M.",2002,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Akbaba-An Agent For The Angry Birds Ai Challenge Based On Search And Simulation,"In this paper, we report on our entry for the AI Birds competition, where we designed, implemented, and evaluated an agent for the physics puzzle computer game Angry Birds. Our agent uses search and simulation to find appropriate parameters for launching birds. While there are other methods that focus on qualitative reasoning about physical systems we try to combine simulation and adjustable abstractions to efficiently traverse the possibly infinite search space. The agent features a hierarchical search scheme where different levels of abstractions are used. At any level, it uses simulation to rate subspaces that should be further explored in more detail on the next levels. We evaluate single components of our agent and we also compare the overall performance of different versions of our agent. We show that our approach yields a competitive solution on the standard set of levels. © 2009-2012 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TCIAIG.2015.2478703,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games,"Schiffer S., Jourenko M., Lakemeyer G.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Algorithms Based On Computational Intelligence For Autonomous Physical Rehabilitation At Home,"Exergames provide efficient and motivating training mechanisms to support physical rehabilitation at home. Nonetheless, current exergame examples lack some important aspects which cannot be disregarded in rehabilitation. Exergames should: (i) modify the game difficulty adapting to patient's gameplay performance, (ii) monitor if the exercise is correctly executed, and (iii) provide continuous motivation. In this study, we present a game engine which implements computer intelligence-based solutions to provide real-time adaptation, on-line monitoring and an engaging gameplay experience. The game engine applies real-time adaptation using the Quest Bayesian approach to modify the game difficulty according to the patient's performance. Besides, it employs a fuzzy system to monitor the execution of the exercises according to the parameters set by the therapists and provides on-line feedback to guide the patient during the execution of the exercise. Finally, a motivating game experience is provided using rewards and adding random enrichments during the game. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",doi,10.1007/978-3-319-18164-6_23,Scopus,"Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies","Borghese N.A., Lanzi P.L., Mainetti R., Pirovano M., Surer E.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Allergen Exposure Modifies The Relation Of Sensitization To Fraction Of Exhaled Nitric Oxide Levels In Children At Risk For Allergy And Asthma,"Background: Studies on airway inflammation, measured as fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (Feno), have focused on its relation to control of asthma, but the contribution of allergen exposure to the increase in Feno levels is unknown. Objective: We evaluated (1) whether Feno levels were increased in children with allergic sensitization or asthma; (2) whether specific allergen exposure increased Feno levels in sensitized, but not unsensitized, children; and (3) whether sedentary behavior increased Feno levels independent of allergen exposures. Methods: At age 12 years, in a birth cohort of children with a parental history of allergy or asthma, we measured bed dust allergen (dust mite, cat, and cockroach) by means of ELISA, specific allergic sensitization primarily based on specific IgE levels, and respiratory disease (current asthma, rhinitis, and wheeze) and hours of television viewing/video game playing by means of questionnaire. Children performed spirometric maneuvers before and after bronchodilator responses and had Feno levels measured by using electrochemical detection methods (NIOX MINO). Results: Feno levels were increased in children with current asthma (32.2 ppb), wheeze (27.0 ppb), or rhinitis (23.2 ppb) compared with subjects without these respective symptoms/diagnoses (16.4-16.6 ppb, P < .005 for all comparisons). Allergic sensitization to indoor allergens (cat, dog, and dust mite) predicted higher Feno levels and explained one third of the variability in Feno levels. Feno levels were highest in children both sensitized and exposed to dust mite. Greater than 10 hours of weekday television viewing was associated with a 0.64-log increase in Feno levels after controlling for indoor allergen exposure, body mass index, and allergic sensitization. Conclusion: Allergen exposures and sedentary behavior (television viewing/video game playing) might increase airway inflammation, which was measured as the Feno. © 2011 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.",doi,10.1016/j.jaci.2011.01.066,Scopus,Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology,"Sordillo J.E., Webb T., Kwan D., Kamel J., Hoffman E., Milton D.K., Gold D.R.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Altered Cardiorespiratory Coupling In Young Male Adults With Excessive Online Gaming,"Introduction: This study aimed to investigate changes in heart rate variability and cardiorespiratory coupling in male college students with problematic Internet use (PIU) excessive gaming type during action video game play to assess the relationship between PIU tendency and central autonomic regulation. Method: Electrocardiograms and respiration were simultaneously recorded from 22 male participants with excessive online gaming and 22 controls during action video game play. Sample entropy (SampEn) was computed to assess autonomic regularity, and cross-SampEn was calculated to quantify autonomic coordination. Results: During video game play, reduced cardiorespiratory coupling (CRC) was observed in individuals with PIU excessive gaming type compared with controls, implicating central autonomic dysregulation. The PIU tendency was associated with the severity of autonomic dysregulation. Conclusion: These findings indicate impaired CRC in PIU excessive gaming type, which may reflect alterations of central inhibitory control over autonomic responses to pleasurable online stimuli. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",doi,10.1016/j.biopsycho.2015.07.016,Scopus,Biological Psychology,"Chang J.S., Kim E.Y., Jung D., Jeong S.H., Kim Y., Roh M.-S., Ahn Y.M., Hahm B.-J.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Amygdala-Prefrontal Cortex Functional Connectivity During Threat-Induced Anxiety And Goal Distraction,"BACKGROUND: Anxiety produced by environmental threats can impair goal-directed processing and is associated with a range of psychiatric disorders, particularly when aversive events occur unpredictably. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is thought to implement controls that minimize performance disruptions from threat-induced anxiety and goal distraction by modulating activity in regions involved in threat detection, such as the amygdala. The inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and ventromedial PFC (vmPFC) have been linked to the regulation of anxiety during threat exposure. We developed a paradigm to determine if threat-induced anxiety would enhance functional connectivity between the amygdala and IFG, OFC, and vmPFC. METHODS: Healthy adults performed a computer-gaming style task involving capturing prey and evading predators to optimize monetary rewards while exposed to the threat of unpredictable shock. Psychophysiological recording (n 5 26) and functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning (n 5 17) were collected during the task in separate cohorts. Task-specific changes in functional connectivity with the amygdala were examined using psychophysiological interaction analysis. RESULTS: Threat exposure resulted in greater arousal measured by increased skin conductance but did not influence performance (i.e., monetary losses or rewards). Greater functional connectivity between the right amygdala and bilateral IFG, OFC, vmPFC, anterior cingulate cortex, and frontopolar cortex was associated with threat exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to unpredictable threat modulates amygdala-PFC functional connectivity that may help maintain performance when experiencing anxiety induced by threat. Our paradigm is well-suited to explore the neural underpinnings of the anxiety response to unpredictable threat in patients with various anxiety disorders.",doi,10.1016/j.biopsych.2014.03.030,Scopus,Biological Psychiatry,"Gold A.L., Morey R.A., McCarthy G.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,An Annotation Tool For Automatically Triangulating Individuals' Psychophysiological Emotional Reactions To Digital Media Stimuli,"Current affective user experience studies require both laborious and time-consuming data analysis, as well as dedicated affective classification algorithms. Moreover, the high technical complexity and lack of general guidelines for developing these affective classification algorithms further limits the comparability of the obtained results. In this paper we target this issue by presenting a tool capable of automatically annotating and triangulating players' physiologically interpreted emotional reactions to in-game events. This tool was initially motivated by an experimental psychology study regarding the emotional habituation effects of audio-visual stimuli in digital games and we expect it to contribute in future similar studies by providing both a deeper and more objective analysis on the affective aspects of user experience. We also hope it will contribute towards the rapid implementation and accessibility of this type of studies by open-sourcing it. Throughout this paper we describe the development and benefits presented by our tool, which include: enabling researchers to conduct objective a posteriori analyses without disturbing the gameplay experience, automating the annotation and emotional response identification process, and formatted data exporting for further analysis in third-party statistical software applications. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",doi,10.1016/j.entcom.2015.06.003,Scopus,Entertainment Computing,"Nogueira P.A., Torres V., Rodrigues R., Oliveira E.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,An Update To The Systematic Literature Review Of Empirical Evidence Of The Impacts And Outcomes Of Computer Games And Serious Games,"Continuing interest in digital games indicated that it would be useful to update Connolly et al.'s (2012) systematic literature review of empirical evidence about the positive impacts and outcomes of games. Since a large number of papers was identified in the period from 2009 to 2014, the current review focused on 143 papers that provided higher quality evidence about the positive outcomes of games. Connolly et al.'s multidimensional analysis of games and their outcomes provided a useful framework for organising the varied research in this area. The most frequently occurring outcome reported for games for learning was knowledge acquisition, while entertainment games addressed a broader range of affective, behaviour change, perceptual and cognitive and physiological outcomes. Games for learning were found across varied topics with STEM subjects and health the most popular. Future research on digital games would benefit from a systematic programme of experimental work, examining in detail which game features are most effective in promoting engagement and supporting learning. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.compedu.2015.11.003,Scopus,Computers and Education,"Boyle E.A., Hainey T., Connolly T.M., Gray G., Earp J., Ott M., Lim T., Ninaus M., Ribeiro C., Pereira J.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Analysis Of The Characteristics Of Competitive Badminton,"Objective: To describe the characteristics of badminton in order to determine the energy requirements, temporal structure, and movements in the game that indicate performance level. To use the findings to plan training with greater precision. Methods: Eleven badminton players (mean (SD) age 21.8 (3.26) years) with international experience from four different countries (France, Italy, Spain, and Portugal) were studied. Two of the Spanish players were monitored in several matches, giving a total of 14 samples, all during the 1999 Spanish International Tournament. Blood lactate concentration was measured with a reflective photometer. Maximum and average heart rates were recorded with a heart rate monitor. Temporal structure and actions during the matches were determined from video recordings. All variables were measured during and after the game and later analysed using a descriptive study. Results: The results confirmed the high demands of the sport, with a maximum heart rate of 190.5 beats/min and an average of 173.5 beats/min during matches over 28 minutes long and performance intervals of 6.4 seconds and rest time of 12.9 seconds between exchanges. Conclusions: The results suggest that badminton is characterised by repetitive efforts of alactic nature and great intensity which are cantinuously performed throughout the match. An awareness of these characteristics, together with data on the correlations between certain actions such as unforced errors and winning shots and the final result of the match, will aid in more appropriate planning and monitoring of specific training.",doi,10.1136/bjsm.37.1.62,Scopus,British Journal of Sports Medicine,"Cabello Manrique D., González-Badillo J.J.",2003,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Anterior Insula Activity Reflects The Effects Of Intentionality On The Anticipation Of Aversive Stimulation,"If someone causes you harm, your affective reaction to that person might be profoundly influenced by your inferences about the intentionality of their actions. In the present study, we aimed to understand how affective responses to a biologically salient aversive outcome administered by others are modulated by the extent to which a given individual is judged to have deliberately or inadvertently delivered the outcome. Using fMRI, we examined how neural responses to anticipation and receipt of an aversive stimulus are modulated by this fundamental social judgment. We found that affective evaluations about an individual whose actions led to either noxious or neutral consequences for the subject did indeed depend on the perceived intentions of that individual. At the neural level, activity in the anterior insula correlated with the interaction between perceived intentionality and anticipated outcome valence, suggesting that this region reflects the influence of mental state attribution on aversive expectations. © 2014 the authors.",doi,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1126-14.2014,Scopus,Journal of Neuroscience,"Liljeholm M., Dunne S., O'Doherty J.P.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Are Cardiovascular Responses To Behavioral Stressors A Stable Individual Difference Variable In Childhood?,"The present paper reports two studies which address the extent to which cardiovascular responses to behavioral stress can be conceptualised as a stable individual difference variable in children. In the first study, eighth grade girls (mean age = 14.2 yrs) who had participated in a study of the familial aggregation of cardiovascular responses to behavioral stress were asked to repeat the assessment protocol when they were in (he ninth grade (mean age = 15.1 yrs). Results showed that mean task‐induced increases in diastolic blood pressure and heart rate during serial subtraction, mirror image tracing, and isometric handgrip tasks were reliable across test sessions, particularly due to the reliable increases exhibited during the mirror image tracing task. In the second study, fifth grade boys (mean age = 10.4 yrs) who had participated in a previous experiment (Matthews & Jennings, 1984) of cardiovascular responses during a video game were tested in the ninth grade (mean age ‐ 14.0 yrs) in the protocol used in Study 1. Results showed that mean tusk‐induced increases in diastolic blood pressure and heart rate during video games were related to mean task‐induced increases during serial subtraction, mirror image tracing, and isometric handgrip tasks over three years Liter. The association for heart rate increases during the video game and isometric handgrip task was particularly impressive. These results suggest that task‐induced diastolic blood pressure and heart rate responses of children are stable over substantial periods of time and amiss important developmental transitions, and generalize across tasks requiring qualitatively different behavioral responses. Nonetheless, future research is needed in adults and children to further identify factors which influence the stability and generalizability of cardiovascular responses to behavioral stress.

,Are The Effects Of Unreal Violent Video Games Pronounced When Playing With A Virtual Reality System?,"This study was conducted to analyze the short-term effects of violent electronic games, played with or without a virtual reality (VR) device, on the instigation of aggressive behavior. Physiological arousal (heart rate (HR)), priming of aggressive thoughts, and state hostility were also measured to test their possible mediation on the relationship between playing the violent game (VG) and aggression. The participants - 148 undergraduate students - were randomly assigned to four treatment conditions: two groups played a violent computer game (Unreal Tournament), and the other two a non-violent game (Motocross Madness), half with a VR device and the remaining participants on the computer screen. In order to assess the game effects the following instruments were used: a BIOPAC System MP100 to measure HR, an Emotional Stroop task to analyze the priming of aggressive and fear thoughts, a self-report State Hostility Scale to measure hostility, and a competitive reaction-time task to assess aggressive behavior. The main results indicated that the violent computer game had effects on state hostility and aggression. Although no significant mediation effect could be detected, regression analyses showed an indirect effect of state hostility between playing a VG and aggression. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",doi,10.1002/ab.20272,Scopus,Aggressive Behavior,"Arriaga P., Esteves F., Carneiro P., Monteiro M.B.",2008,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,"Are There Optimal Levels Of Arousal To Memory? Effects Of Arousal, Centrality, And Familiarity On Brand Memory In Video Games","Using a modified first-person shooter game, Counter Strike 2, this study tested (1) if the Yerkes-Dodson law could be applied to the relationship between physiological arousal (skin conductance) and brand memory in the new interactive technology setting; (2) if central and familiar ads are better recognized; and (3) if there are any interaction effects among arousal, centrality, and familiarity on brand memory. A pre-test was conducted to estimate the cut-off points of arousal into three levels (low, medium, and high) in the identical setting. Through within-subject analysis, a total of 550 cases were categorized into the three levels of arousal and analyzed. The results showed the highest recognition scores at the medium level of arousal, and no significant difference between the medium and high levels of arousal in brand memory. The participants remembered better centrally located brands than peripheral brands. Familiarity also had a positive relationship with the levels of arousal. Particularly, the recognition scores for centrally located brands increased with the levels of arousal, but no difference was found for peripheral brands. Findings and implications were discussed. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

,Assessment With Computer Agents That Engage In Conversational Dialogues And Trialogues With Learners,"This article describes conversation-based assessments with computer agents that interact with humans through chat, talking heads, or embodied animated avatars. Some of these agents perform actions, interact with multimedia, hold conversations with humans in natural language, and adaptively respond to a person's actions, verbal contributions, and emotions. Data are logged throughout the interactions in order to assess the individual's mastery of subject matters, skills, and proficiencies on both cognitive and noncognitive characteristics. There are different agent-based designs that focus on learning and assessment. Dialogues occur between one agent and one human, as in the case of intelligent tutoring systems. Three-party conversations, called trialogues, involve two agents interacting with a human. The two agents can take on different roles (such as tutors and peers), model actions and social interactions, stage arguments, solicit help from the human, and collaboratively solve problems. Examples of assessment with these agent-based environments are presented in the context of intelligent tutoring, educational games, and interventions to help struggling adult readers. Most of these involve assessment at varying grain sizes to guide the intelligent interaction, but conversation-based assessment with agents is also currently being used in high stakes assessments. © 2017",doi,10.1016/j.chb.2017.03.041,Scopus,Computers in Human Behavior,"Graesser A.C., Cai Z., Morgan B., Wang L.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Association Between Feeling Upon Awakening And Use Of Information Technology Devices In Japanese Children,"Background: The objective of this study was to clarify the relationship between feeling upon awakening (FA) and time spent using information technology (IT) devices by children in kindergartens, elementary schools, and junior high schools in Shimane, Japan. Methods: In October 2008, a self-report survey was distributed to 2075 children in kindergartens (n = 261), elementary schools (n = 1162), and junior high schools (n = 652) in Shimane, Japan. The questionnaire gathered data on sex, school year, feeling upon awakening, and time spent using IT devices after school (television, videos on television, video games, personal computers, and cellular phones). After adjusting for sex and school year, data were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression analysis to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: A total of 2030 children completed this survey (response rate, 97.8%). Negative FA was associated with watching television more than 2 hours/day (OR = 1.51, 95% CI = 1.23-1.85), playing video games more than 30 minutes/day (1.50, 1.20-1.87), and using personal computers more than 30 minutes/day (1.35, 1.04-1.75). Conclusions: Time spent using IT devices affected the FA of children in kindergarten through junior high school. We propose the development of guidelines regarding the appropriate amount of time this population should spend using IT devices. © 2011 by the Japan Epidemiological Association.",doi,10.2188/jea.JE20110019,Scopus,Journal of Epidemiology,"Kondo Y., Tanabe T., Kobayashi-Miura M., Amano H., Yamaguchi N., Kamura M., Fujita Y.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Associations Between Screen-Based Sedentary Behavior And Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors In Korean Youth,"The purposes of this study were to: 1) describe the patterns of screen-based sedentary behaviors, and 2) examine the association between screen-based sedentary behavior and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in representative Korean children and adolescents, aged 12 to 18 yr, in the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Screenbased sedentary behavior was measured using self-report questionnaires that included items for time spent watching TV and playing PC/video games. Physical activity was measured using items for frequency and duration of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). CVD risk factors such as body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure were measured. Boys spent more time playing PC/ video games, and girls spent more time watching TV. After adjusting for age, gender, annual household income, and MVPA, an additional hour of watching TV was significantly associated with the risk of overweight (OR 1.17 [95% CI 1.03-1.33]), high abdominal adiposity (OR 1.27 [1.06-1.51]), and low HDL cholesterol (OR 1.27 [1.10-1.47]). An additional hour spent playing PC/video games also increased the risk of high abdominal adiposity (OR 1.20 [1.03-1.40]). Prospective observations and interventions are needed to determine causal relationships between screen-based sedentary behavior and CVD risk profiles in Korean youth. © 2012 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.",doi,10.3346/jkms.2012.27.4.388,Scopus,Journal of Korean Medical Science,"Byun W., Dowda M., Pate R.R.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Attitude Formation From Product Trial: Distinct Roles Of Cognition And Affect For Hedonic And Functional Products,"Affective and cognitive responses to a product trial are examined in an experiment containing two cells representing two product types: hedonic and functional. The stimulus products were a computer game and grammar-checking software. Forty-two college students comprised the sample for the experiment. The specific affective responses studied are pleasure and arousal, and brand cognitions are represented as the expectancy value from brand attributes (the product of brand beliefs, belief confidence, and attribute evaluations, summed across the attributes (Σ biciei)). The relative level and influence of affective and cognitive responses to a product trial were shown to differ significantly, depending on whether the product was hedonic or functional in nature. Specifically, for the hedonic product, felt arousal during the trial was higher than for the functional product, and emotional responses were significant antecedents of subjects' evaluations of the trial experience. Brand cognitions, however, were not significantly related to trial evaluations for the hedonic product. In contrast, for the functional product, brand cognitions and pleasure were significant antecedents of trial evaluations, but arousal was not. The findings of this study demonstrate the importance of considering both the cognitive structure created by a product trial and the consumer's emotional reactions to the trial. For hedonic products, especially, emotional responses to the trial were shown to be powerful antecedents to consumers' evaluations of a trial experience, and subsequently, brand attitude. Marketers and marketing researchers can use these results to predict which category of responses to product trial (affective or cognitive) will be most important for brand evaluation for the particular product in question. This knowledge may also enable marketers to manipulate aspects of a product trial that are most influential on the set of trial responses that this study has shown to significantly affect brand evaluation for that product type. © 1999 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",doi,10.1002/(SICI)1520-6793(199901)16:1<35::AID-MAR3>3.0.CO;2-U,Scopus,Psychology and Marketing,Kempf D.S.,1999,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Attitude Formation Through Exploration: Valence Asymmetries,"The formation of attitudes toward novel objects was examined as a function of exploratory behavior. An initial experiment, in which participants played a computer game that required them to learn which stimuli, when sampled, produced favorable or unfavorable outcomes, demonstrated learning, attitude formation, and generalization to novel objects. The findings also revealed 2 interesting valence asymmetries: a learning asymmetry involving better learning for negatively valenced than positively valenced objects and a generalization asymmetry involving stronger generalization as a function of negative than of positive attitudes. Findings from 4 experiments led to an explanation of the learning asymmetry in terms of information gain being contingent on approach behavior and related the generalization asymmetry to a negativity bias that weighs resemblance to a known negative more heavily than resemblance to a positive.",doi,10.1037/0022-3514.87.3.293,Scopus,Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,"Fazio R.H., Eiser J.R., Shook N.J.",2004,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,"Attitude Generalization: Similarity, Valence, And Extremity","Attitude generalization was explored as a function of object similarity and attitude valence and extremity. Participants in a computer game formed attitudes toward positive and negative, mild or extreme stimuli. How well these attitudes generalized to similar, novel stimuli was then examined. Visual similarity to game targets affected categorization of novel stimuli, such that greater resemblance resulted in more similar classification. However, generalization varied by valence and extremity. Negative attitudes generalized more than positive attitudes, requiring less resemblance for a novel target to be classified as negative. This pattern was more obvious with extreme attitudes than mild attitudes. That is, extreme attitudes were more influential and given more weight than mild attitudes. Also, specific conditions were identified under which positive attitudes proved more influential than negative attitudes. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

,"Autism, Serious Games And Robotics: Tangible Reality Or Abuse Of Language? [Autisme, Jeux Sérieux Et Robotique : Réalité Tangible Ou Abus De Langage ?]","The number of studies focusing on the use of information technology and robotics for individuals with autism has been rising steeply over the last 15 years. Here, we briefly summarize the hope, but also the issues, of 2 domains we consider the most exciting: (1) the computation of serious game aiming at training specific skills (emotion recognition, social interaction); (2) interaction with robotic platforms. We will detail two projects in which we worked as partners, JeMIME for serious games, and Michelangelo for human-robot interaction. We conclude that the potential benefit of the use of information technology and robotics for individuals with autism is enormous given what was achieved in less than 15 years. However, limitations are numerous and clinical validation still lacking. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS",doi,10.1016/j.amp.2017.03.013,Scopus,Annales Medico-Psychologiques,"Cohen D., Grossard C., Grynszpan O., Anzalone S., Boucenna S., Xavier J., Chetouani M., Chaby L.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Automatic Interpretation Of Affective Facial Expressions In The Context Of Interpersonal Interaction,"This paper proposes a method for interpretation of the emotions detected in facial expressions in the context of the events that cause them. The method was developed to analyze the video recordings of facial expressions depicted during a collaborative game played as a part of the Mars-500 experiment. In this experiment, six astronauts were isolated for 520 days in a space station to simulate a flight to Mars. Seven time-dependent components of facial expressions were extracted from the video recordings of the experiment. To interpret these dynamic components, we proposed a mathematical model of emotional events. Genetic programming was used to find the locations, types, and intensities of the emotional events as well as the way the recorded facial expressions represented reactions to them. By classification of different statistical properties of the data, we found that there are significant relations between the facial expressions of different crew members and a memory effect between the collective emotional states of the crew members. The model of emotional events was validated on previously unseen video recordings of the astronauts. We demonstrated that both genetic search and optimization of the parameters improve the accuracy of the proposed model. This method is a step toward automating the analysis of affective expressions in terms of the cognitive appraisal theory of emotion, which relies on the dependence of the expressed emotion on the causing event. © 2013 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/THMS.2015.2419259,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems,"Barakova E.I., Gorbunov R., Rauterberg M.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Automatic Recognition Of Non-Acted Affective Postures,"The conveyance and recognition of affect and emotion partially determine how people interact with others and how they carry out and perform in their day-to-day activities. Hence, it is becoming necessary to endow technology with the ability to recognize users' affective states to increase the technologies' effectiveness. This paper makes three contributions to this research area. First, we demonstrate recognition models that automatically recognize affective states and affective dimensions from non-acted body postures instead of acted postures. The scenario selected for the training and testing of the automatic recognition models is a body-movement-based video game. Second, when attributing affective labels and dimension levels to the postures represented as faceless avatars, the level of agreement for observers was above chance level. Finally, with the use of the labels and affective dimension levels assigned by the observers as ground truth and the observers' level of agreement as base rate, automatic recognition models grounded on low-level posture descriptions were built and tested for their ability to generalize to new observers and postures using random repeated subsampling validation. The automatic recognition models achieve recognition percentages comparable to the human base rates as hypothesized. © 2011 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TSMCB.2010.2103557,Scopus,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B: Cybernetics","Kleinsmith A., Bianchi-Berthouze N., Steed A.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Autonomic Characteristics Of Defensive Hostility: Reactivity And Recovery To Active And Passive Stressors,"The autonomic characteristics of hostility and defensiveness were assessed in 55 male undergraduates based on composite Cook Medley Hostility (Chost) and Marlowe Crowne Social Desirability (MC) scores to create 4 groups: Defensive Hostile (DH; high MC, high Chost), High Hostile (HH; low MC, high Chost), Defensive (Def; high MC, low Chost) and Low Hostile (LH; low MC, low Chost). All subjects engaged in a video game (VG) and hand cold pressor (CP) task. Cardiovascular responses in DH subjects were predicted to show enhanced sympathetic α and β-adrenergic activity and the least vagal control compared to others across tasks. DH and LH men showed significant heart rate reactivity to the CP task compared to HH men. LH men showed significant reductions in high frequency power (vagal assessment) to the tasks compared to HH men. Future studies may employ harassment techniques and include the factors of gender and ethnicity in their assessments. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

,Autonomous And Decentralized Optimization Of Large-Scale Heterogeneous Wireless Networks By Neural Network Dynamics,"We propose a neurodynamical approach to a large-scale optimization problem in Cognitive Wireless Clouds, in which a huge number of mobile terminals with multiple different air interfaces autonomously utilize the most appropriate infrastructure wireless networks, by sensing available wireless networks, selecting the most appropriate one, and reconfiguring themselves with seamless handover to the target networks. To deal with such a cognitive radio network, game theory has been applied in order to analyze the stability of the dynamical systems consisting of the mobile terminals' distributed behaviors, but it is not a tool for globally optimizing the state of the network. As a natural optimization dynamical system model suitable for large-scale complex systems, we introduce the neural network dynamics which converges to an optimal state since its property is to continually decrease its energy function. In this paper, we apply such neurodynamics to the optimization problem of radio access technology selection. We compose a neural network that solves the problem, and we show that it is possible to improve total average throughput simply by using distributed and autonomous neuron updates on the terminal side.

,Axiomatic Scalable Neurocontroller Analysis Via The Shapley Value,"One of the major challenges in the field of neurally driven evolved autonomous agents is deciphering the neural mechanisms underlying their behavior. Aiming at this goal, we have developed the multi-perturbation Shapley value analysis (MSA) - the first axiomatic and rigorous method for deducing causal function localization from multiple-perturbation data, substantially improving on earlier approaches. Based on fundamental concepts from game theory, the MSA provides a formal way of defining and quantifying the contributions of network elements, as well as the functional interactions between them. The previously presented versions of the MSA require full knowledge (or at least an approximation) of the network's performance under all possible multiple perturbations, limiting their applicability to systems with a small number of elements. This article focuses on presenting new scalable MSA variants, allowing for the analysis of large complex networks in an efficient manner, including large-scale neurocontrollers. The successful operation of the MSA along with the new variants is demonstrated in the analysis of several neurocontrollers solving a food foraging task, consisting of up to 100 neural elements. ©2006 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",doi,10.1162/artl.2006.12.3.333,Scopus,Artificial Life,"Keinan A., Sandbank B., Hilgetag C.C., Meilijson I., Ruppin E.",2006,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Balancing For Gross Motor Ability In Exergaming Between Youth With Cerebral Palsy At Gross Motor Function Classification System Levels Ii And Iii,"Objective: To test how three custom-built balancing algorithms minimize differences in game success, time above 40% heart rate reserve (HRR), and enjoyment between youth with cerebral palsy (CP) who have different gross motor function capabilities. Youth at Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) level II (unassisted walking) and level III (mobility aids needed for walking) competed in a cycling-based exercise video game that tested three balancing algorithms. Materials and Methods: Three algorithms: A control (generic-balancing [GB]), a constant non-person specific (One-Speed-For-All [OSFA]), and a person-specific (Target-Cadence [TC]) algorithms were built. In this prospective repeated measures intervention trial with randomized and blinded algorithm assignment, 10 youth with CP aged 10-16 years (X ± standard deviation = 12.4 ± 1.8 years; GMFCS level II n = 4, III n = 6) played six exergaming sessions using each of the three algorithms. Outcomes included game success as measured by a normalized game score, time above 40% HRR, and enjoyment. Results: The TC algorithm balanced game success between GMFCS levels similarly to GB (P = 0.11) and OSFA (P = 0.41). TC showed poorer balancing in time above 40% HRR compared to GB (P = 0.02) and OSFA (P = 0.02). Enjoyment ratings were high (6.4 ± 0.7/7) and consistent between all algorithms (TC vs. GB: P = 0.80 and TC vs. OSFA: P = 0.19). Conclusion: TC shows promise in balancing game success and enjoyment but improvements are needed to balance between GMFCS levels for cardiovascular exercise. © 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",doi,10.1089/g4h.2016.0073,Scopus,Games for Health Journal,"MacIntosh A., Switzer L., Hernandez H., Hwang S., Schneider A.L.J., Moran D., Graham T.C.N., Fehlings D.L.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Bayesian Learning In Negotiation,"Negotiation has been extensively discussed in game-theoretic, economic and management science literatures for decades. Recent growing interest in autonomous interacting software agents and their potential application in areas such as electronic commerce has give increased importance to automated negotiation. Evidence both from theoretical analysis and from observations of human interactions suggests that if decision makers can somehow take into consideration what other agents are thinking and furthermore learn during their interactions how other agents behave, their payoff might increase. In this paper, we propose a sequential decision-making model of negotiation, called Bazaar. It provides an adaptive, multi-issue negotiation model capable of exhibiting a rich set of negotiation behaviors. Within the proposed negotiation framework, we model learning as a Bayesian belief update process. In this paper, we present both theoretical analysis and initial experimental results showing that learning is beneficial in the sequential negotiation model. © 1998 Academic Press Limited.",doi,10.1006/ijhc.1997.0164,Scopus,International Journal of Human Computer Studies,"Zeng D., Sycara K.",1998,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Bio-Affective Computer Interface For Game Interaction,"Affective bio-feedback can be an important instrument to enhance the game experience. Several studies have provided evidence of the usefulness of physiological signals for affective gaming; however, due to the limited knowledge about the distinctive autonomic signatures for every emotion, the pattern matching models employed are limited in the number of emotions they are able to classify. This paper presents a bio-affective gaming interface (BAGI) that can be used to customize a game experience according to the player's emotional response. Its architecture offers important characteristics for gaming that are important because they make possible the reusability of previous findings and the inclusion of new models to the system. In order to prove the effectiveness of BAGI, two different types of neural networks have been trained to recognize emotions. They were incorporated into the system to customize, in real-time, the computer wallpaper according to the emotion experienced by the user. Best results were obtained with a probabilistic neural network with accuracy results of 84.46% on the training data and 78.38% on the validation for new independent data sets.

,Biopad: Leveraging Off-The-Shelf Video Games For Stress Self-Regulation.,"This paper presents an approach to use commercial videogames for biofeedback training. It consists of intercepting signals from the game controller and adapting them in real-time based on physiological measurements from the player. We present three sample implementations and a case study for teaching stress self-regulation via an immersive car racing game. We use a crossover gaming device to manipulate controller signals, and a respiratory sensor to monitor the players' breathing rate. We then alter the speed of the car to encourage slow, deep breathing, in this way allowing players to reduce their arousal while playing the game. We evaluate the approach against an alternative form of biofeedback that uses a graphic overlay to convey physiological information, and a control condition (playing the game without biofeedback). Experimental results show that our approach can promote deep breathing during gameplay, and also during a subsequent task, once biofeedback is removed. Our results also indicate that delivering biofeedback through subtle changes in gameplay can be as effective as delivering them directly through a visual display. These results open the possibility to develop low-cost and engaging biofeedback interventions using a variety of commercial videogames to promote adherence.",doi,10.1109/JBHI.2017.2671788,pubmed,IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,"Wang, Zelun; Parnandi, Avinash; Gutierrez-Osuna, Ricardo",2017,NA,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Brain Fmri Study Of Crave Induced By Cue Pictures In Online Game Addicts (Male Adolescents),"Objective: To study crave-related cerebral regions induced by game figure cues in online game addicts. fMRI brain imaging was done when the subjects were shown picture cues of the WoW (World of Warcraft, Version: 4.1.014250) game. Methods: 10 male addicts of WoW were selected as addicts' group, and 10 other healthy male non-addicts who were matched by age, were used as non-game addicts' group. All volunteers participated in fMRI paradigms. WoW associated cue pictures and neutral pictures were shown. We examined functional cerebral regions activated by the pictures with 3.0. T Philips MRI. The imaging signals' database was analyzed by SPM5. The correlation between game craving scores and different image results were assessed. Results: When the game addicts watch the pictures, some brain areas show increased signal activity namely: dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, bilateral temporal cortex, cerebellum, right inferior parietal lobule, right cuneus, right hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, left caudate nucleus. But in these same brain regions we did not observe remarkable activities in the control group. Differential image signal densities of the addict group were subtracted from the health control group, results of which were expressed in the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, inferior parietal lobe and inferior temporal gyrus, cerebellum, right insular and the right angular gyrus. The increased imaging signal densities were significant and positively correlated with the craving scale scores in the bilateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex and right inferior parietal lobe. Conclusions: Craving of online game addicts was successfully induced by game cue pictures. Crave related brain areas are: dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and right inferior parietal lobe. The brain regions are overlapped with cognitive and emotion related processing brain areas. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..",doi,10.1016/j.bbr.2012.05.005,Scopus,Behavioural Brain Research,"Sun Y., Ying H., Seetohul R.M., Xuemei W., Ya Z., Qian L., Guoqing X., Ye S.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas

,Building Up Serious Games With An Artificial Life Approach: Two Case Studies,"Artificial Life (AL) studies how to reproduce life-like phenomena exploring the life as could be in artificial systems (software, hardware, or hybrid). This challenging scientific perspective has produced a number of programming techniques often applied to solve concrete problems (Data Analysis, Process Optimization, Social Simulations, etc.). Computer Gaming is a field where AL techniques are applied. There are many successfully Alife products for pure entertainment (e.g., Tamagotchi and Creatures) and for educational objectives (e.g., Avida-Ed). However, we notice that all AL-Based games share a general flavor: they refer in someway to biological scenarios. In other terms, they represent often a sort of popularization of AL experiments designed for non-scientists. In this paper we argue that AL programming techniques (or more basically bio-inspired computational algorithms) could be used to develop generic games (e.g., sports, adventures, business games, etc.) without any relation with a biological perspective. We describe BreedBot and Learn2Lead, two Serious Games that we think could be paradigmatic examples about how to use AL techniques in different ways and fields that could be very different from their biological roots. BreedBot and its sequels (BestBot and BrianFarm) have been developed to disseminate the core-concepts of Autonomous Robotics and Learn2Lead has been developed to teach Psychological Theories of Teamwork in Small and Medium Enterprises. In BreedBot, AL techniques are used to develop the player–game interaction and they are explicitly visible by the user (he/she has to train/evolve a population of artificial agents). At the opposite side, Lear2lead has an old style appearance but it hides an AL engine. In this case AL techniques are used to model the game mechanics (e.g., artificial team dynamics and avatars’ behavior). Both games are also able to be played online (www.​nac.​unina.​it/​bestbot2 and www.​unina.​l2l.​it). © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.",doi,10.1007/978-3-642-37577-4_10,Scopus,"Evolution, Complexity and Artificial Life","Gigliotta O., Miglino O., Schembri M., Di Ferdinando A.",2014,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Can Personality Traits Predict Pathological Responses To Audiovisual Stimulation?,"The ""Pockemon shock"" is the most famous accident in the history of the broadcasting industry in Japan. Based on the experiences of this unfortunate accident from famous animation program ""Pocket Monster"", this study focused on the psychology and psychosomatics of the patients. A head-mounted display was used as the three-dimensional image presentation device and ""Descent"", a free software shooting game, was used as the software. Ten healthy adult male volunteers were used in this experiment after obtaining their informed consent. The oxygen metabolic change in the anterior lobe of the brain was measured by near infrared spectroscopy and recorded on an electrocardiogram. The mental scaling tendency of the object was analyzed using the type A behavior pattern and the hostility scaling. The Cook and Medley hostility (HO) scale from the Minnesota multiphasic personality inventory (MMPI) was also used in this experiment. From this scaling methodology, the paranoid scale, cynicism scale, lie scale, social support quality and social support quantity were calculated. All measured time series data were kept in the normal range, and no fatal arrhythmia or epilepsy were observed during experiments. In some cases, the brain oxygen metabolism may completely differ for the objects of Type A and Type B behavior patterns. On the whole, correlation did not become significant in type A scaling and hostility scaling. In a comparison of the percent changes of the HF in HRV with lie scaling, significant negative correlation was observed. The social support quantity was calculated from Cook and Medley, and significant negative correlations were observed with percent changes of LF/HF in HRV. The lie scale and social support quantity are opposite scaling. The sympathetic nervous system and parasympathetic nervous system have an opposite function also. Therefore, our results showed an interesting phenomenon, when considering the relationship between the autonomic function and the pathophysiological reaction to the audiovisual stimulations. As for the photo sensitive epilepsy, it was reported to be only 5-10% for all patients. Therefore, 90% or more of the cause could not be determined in patients who started a morbid response. The results in this study suggest that the autonomic function was connected to the mental tendency of the objects. By examining such directivity, it is expected that subjects, which show morbid reaction to an audiovisual stimulation, can be screened beforehand. © 2003 Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.

,Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Training In High School Using Avatars In Virtual Worlds: An International Feasibility Study,"Background: Approximately 300,000 people suffer sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) annually in the United States. Less than 30% of out-of-hospital victims receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) despite the American Heart Association training over 12 million laypersons annually to conduct CPR. New engaging learning methods are needed for CPR education, especially in schools. Massively multiplayer virtual worlds (MMVW) offer platforms for serious games that are promising learning methods that take advantage of the computer capabilities of today's youth (ie, the digital native generation). Objective: Our main aim was to assess the feasibility of cardiopulmonary resuscitation training in high school students by using avatars in MMVM. We also analyzed experiences, self-efficacy, and concentration in response to training. Methods: In this prospective international collaborative study, an e-learning method was used with high school students in Sweden and the United States. A software game platform was modified for use as a serious game to train in emergency medical situations. Using MMVW technology, participants in teams of 3 were engaged in virtual-world scenarios to learn how to treat victims suffering cardiac arrest. Short debriefings were carried out after each scenario. A total of 36 high school students (Sweden, n=12; United States, n=24) participated. Their self-efficacy and concentration (task motivation) were assessed. An exit questionnaire was used to solicit experiences and attitudes toward this type of training. Among the Swedish students, a follow-up was carried out after 6 months. Depending on the distributions, t tests or Mann-Whitney tests were used. Correlation between variables was assessed by using Spearman rank correlation. Regression analyses were used for time-dependent variables. Results: The participants enjoyed the training and reported a self-perceived benefit as a consequence of training. The mean rating for self-efficacy increased from 5.8/7 (SD 0.72) to 6.5/7 (SD 0.57, P<.001). In the Swedish follow-up, it subsequently increased from 5.7/7 (SD 0.56) to 6.3/7 (SD 0.38, P=.006). In the Swedish group, the mean concentration value increased from 52.4/100 (SD 9.8) to 62.7/100 (SD 8.9, P=.05); in the US group, the concentration value increased from 70.8/100 (SD 7.9) to 82.5/100 (SD 4.7, P<.001). We found a significant positive correlation (P<.001) between self-efficacy and concentration scores. Overall, the participants were moderately or highly immersed and the software was easy to use. Conclusions: By using online MMVWs, team training in CPR is feasible and reliable for this international group of high school students (Sweden and United States). A high level of appreciation was reported among these adolescents and their self-efficacy increased significantly. The described training is a novel and interesting way to learn CPR teamwork, and in the future could be combined with psychomotor skills training. © Filippo Castiglione.",doi,10.2196/jmir.1715,Scopus,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"Creutzfel dt J., Hedman L., Heinrichs L., Youngblood P., Felländer-Tsai L.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Cardiovascular Changes In Video-Game Players. Cause For Concern?,"Video games are one of the most popular recreational activities among Americans of all ages, especially teenaged boys and young men. Studies of the health hazards of video-game playing have linked seizures, psychologic disturbances, and other health problems with the games. The study reported here measured changes in blood pessure and heart rate that occurred in 23 young men when they played a video game. The mean systolic blood pressure for the entire group was considerably higher during play than before or after and was significantly higher in novice players than in more skilled players. Heart rate was also significantly higher during play. In view of these results, other cardiovascular changes might be expected to occur during video-game playing. Although the changes reported here were minor, even minor cardiovascular alterations could potentially prove serious in persons with cardiovascular disease.",doi,10.1080/00325481.1983.11698546,Scopus,Postgraduate Medicine,"Gwinup G., Haw T., Elias A.",1983,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,"Causing Fear, Suspense, And Anxiety Using Sound Design In Computer Games","This chapter provides a theoretical foundation for the study of how emotions are affected by game sound as well as empirical evidence for determining how to promote fear, suspense, and anxiety in players using sound effects. Four perspectives on emotions are described: Darwinian, James-Lange, cognitive, and social constructivist. Three basic properties of diegetic sound effects were studied: volume, timing, and source. Results strongly suggest that the best sound design for causing fear is high volume and timed sound effects (synchronized game sound with visual moment) and somewhat suggest that sourced sound effects also promote fear. For anxiety, results strongly suggest that the best sound design is medium volume sound effects. Results also suggest that acousmatic and untimed sound effects evoke suspense rather than anxiety. Low volume sound effects are not effective at evoking fear, suspense, and anxiety due to potential masking by other sounds. Implications and future research directions are presented. © 2011, IGI Global.",doi,10.4018/978-1-61692-828-5.ch009,Scopus,Game Sound Technology and Player Interaction: Concepts and Developments,"Toprac P., Abdel-Meguid A.",2010,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Changes In Blood Pressure Reactivity And 24-Hour Blood Pressure Profile Occurring At Puberty,"To evaluate blood pressure reactivity in children and its changes in adolescents, the acute pressor response to a video-game stress test and the noninvasive ambulatory blood pressure monitoring were evaluated in 62 healthy children divided into three age groups. Basal blood pressure values were measured according to the NIH Task Force. With baseline measures and body mass index controlled for, analysis of covariance showed that the video game provoked significant and incremental cardiovascular reac tivity across the games in adolescents when compared with the two other groups of children. The same group of children showed also a significantly higher systolic ambu latory pressure during the daytime, whereas no significant difference was observed by basal BP measurement. In conclusion an increased reactivity to external stimuli was observed in adolescents, and this pattern was strictly associated with a higher daily blood pressure. © 1994, Sage Publications.

,Characteristics Of The Early Flight Phase In The Olympic Ski Jumping Competition,"Early flight phase (approximately 40 m) of the athletes participating in the final round of the individual large hill ski jumping competition in Salt Lake City Olympics was filmed with two high-speed pan & tilt video cameras. The results showed that jumpers' steady flight position was almost completed within 0.5 s. The most significant correlation with the length of the jump was found in the angle between the skis and body (r=.714, p≤.001 at 1.1 s after the take-off). This particular phase seemed to be important because the ski angle of attack was also related to the jumping distance at the same phase. Although the more upright ski position relative to flight path resulted in longer jumping distance, the winner of the competition had significantly lower ski position as compared to the other good jumpers. This may be due to the high altitude (>2000 m) of the ski jumping stadium in this competition. Because of the low air density, the aerodynamic forces were also low and this probably caused less skilful jumpers to lean too much forward at this phase. Maintenance of speed seemed to be emphasized in this particular competition. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

,Childhood Obesity Study: A Pilot Study Of The Effect Of The Nutrition Education Program Color My Pyramid,"The need for successful nutrition interventions is critical as the prevalence of childhood obesity increases. Thus, this pilot project examines the effect of a nutrition education program, Color My Pyramid, on children's nutrition knowledge, self-care practices, activity levels, and nutrition status. Using a pretest-posttest, quasiexperimental design, 126 fourth- and fifth-grade students from experimental and control schools are compared. The intervention program incorporates an online component www.MyPyramid.gov, Orem's Self-Care Deficit Nursing Theory, and consists of six classes taught over a 3-month period. Results indicated that the program increased nutrition knowledge in the control group. Furthermore, it increased activity time from pretest to posttest and decreased systolic blood pressure for children in both groups; however, there were no significant differences in BMI percentiles. The findings indicate that Color My Pyramid can be successfully employed in school settings and thus support school nursing practice. © 2009 The Author(s).",doi,10.1177/1059840509333325,Scopus,Journal of School Nursing,"Moore J.B., Pawloski L.R., Goldberg P., Oh K.M., Stoehr A., Baghi H.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Children's Physical Activity Levels And Psychological Correlates In Interactive Dance Versus Aerobic Dance,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to compare children's physical activity (PA) levels, self-efficacy, and enjoyment when experiencing dance-exergaming (Dance Dance Revolution, DDR) and aerobic dance in physical education. Methods: A total of 53 urban fourth grade children were divided into two groups, with one group playing DDR and the other group engaged in aerobic dance. After 15min, the groups switched activities and continued their respective activities for another 15min. Participants wore NL-1000 pedometers in four consecutive sessions, and responded to a questionnaire measuring their self-efficacy and enjoyment toward two dance activities at the end of the first session. Results: Children spent more moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) time (p&lt;0.01, η2=0.49) in aerobic dance than DDR. Additionally, children reported significantly higher self-efficacy (p&lt;0.001, η2=0.28) and enjoyment (p&lt;0.01, η2=0.18) in DDR than in aerobic dance. Conclusion: Health care professionals and educators may not replace the traditional PAs and sports with interactive video games, but may use exergaming as an excellent addition to promote PA. © 2012 Shanghai University of Sport.",doi,10.1016/j.jshs.2013.01.005,Scopus,Journal of Sport and Health Science,"Gao Z., Zhang T., Stodden D.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Children And Electronic Games: A Comparison Of Parents’ And Children’s Perceptions Of Children’s Habits And Preferences In A United States Sample.,"Despite the popularity of violent electronic games, anecdotal evidence suggests that many parents lack even basic information about children's game-playing habits. The goal of the present study was to examine parental knowledge of children's electronic game-playing habits by assessing the congruence between children's and parents' perceptions of child's playing time, parental supervision, game preference, and reaction to actual game-playing. 35 children in Grades 3 to 5 and one parent of each child completed a background questionnaire and played either a violent or nonviolent electronic game. In paired comparisons, parents reported significantly higher estimates of supervision time than children. Most parents either named an incorrect game or were not able to guess their child's favorite game. In 70% of these incorrect matches, children described their favorite game as violent. Parents may underestimate their child's exposure to violence in electronic games. After playing the same electronic game as part of the study, parents reported significantly higher frustration than children. Higher frustration with game-playing could contribute to deficits in parental knowledge of children's playing habits.",doi,10.2466/pr0.1999.85.3.883,anderson2010,Psychological Reports,"Funk, J., Hagan, J., Schimming, J.",1999,NA,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Chronic Exposure To Violent Video Games Is Not Associated With Alterations Of Emotional Memory,"Although acute effects of violent video game (VVG) exposure on affect and behaviour have been studied extensively, less is known about VVG effects on cognition. The present study examined whether chronic exposure to VVGs was associated with alterations in emotional long-term memory. Participants completed an old-new recognition task with 300 pictures of scenes ranging in emotion (negative, neutral and positive). We analysed accuracy and reaction time data using diffusion modelling to test a desensitization hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, VVG players would show reduced memory or a less liberal response bias for negative stimuli, compared with nonplayers. Contrary to the desensitization hypothesis, VVG exposure was not associated with differences in memory or response bias. This result suggests that, unlike other cognitive domains, long-term memory may be robust to deleterious influences of chronic VVG exposure.

,Cnt Nanobombs For Specific Eradication Of Cancer Cells: A New Concept In Cancer Theranostics.,"Whole extermination of cancerous cells/tissue seems no longer to be a dream. Exploiting advanced photoactive nanomaterials such as functionalized fullerenes and carbon nano-tubes (CNTs) can act as CNT nanobombs (CNT-NBs) when exposed to the near infrared (NIR) radiation. PEGylated CNTs tagged with an antibody/aptamer can target cancer cells. Once attached to cancer cells, the NIR emission (700-1100 nm), in which body tissues are mostly transparent, can be applied to CNT-NBs which can absorb the light and get heated up. The resultant enhanced temperature can abolish the cancer. Once stealth CNT-NBs are tagged with imaging moieties, it would be a matter of computer gaming for physician who can inject it for real time visualization and destruction of cancer by activation of the NIR laser. While, many nanosystems (NSs) are still in waiting list for clinical translation, our dreams may come true by applying stealth CNT-NBs against cancer.",doi,10.5681/bi.2011.028,pubmed,BioImpacts : BI,"Omidi, Yadollah",2013,NA,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Coercion Builds Cooperation In Dynamic And Heterogeneous P2p Live Streaming Networks,"Sustaining reasonable performance in a peer-to-peer (P2P) network is contingent upon cooperation among peers. As autonomous agents, peers cooperate only when they are incentivized to do so. Typically, incentives are provided through bilateral exchange of useful data, in a tit-for-tat manner. Unfortunately, good for file sharing and video-on-demand systems as they are, such incentive schemes are ineffective in live streaming systems due mainly to the lack of sufficient opportunity to allow such reciprocity to happen, as recently demonstrated in a pioneering quantitative study. The key insight is that with stringent time constraint, good system performance can only be sustained by judicious peer selection. Despite that some pioneering efforts are done in peer selection, it is as yet a difficult challenge to tackle the inherent non-cooperation of peers in a dynamic and bandwidth-diverse network. In this paper, we meet this challenge by first presenting a novel hierarchical game model, covering strategic interactions among peers, trackers, and the content provider. Based on the analytical insights derived from the repeated game model, we propose a Striker strategy to coerce peers to cooperate, leading to significantly enhanced system performance, as demonstrated by our analytical and simulation results. Most importantly, our proposed incentive schemes are highly practicable in a real-life P2P network. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

,Cognitive-Bias Toward Gaming-Related Words And Disinhibition In World Of Warcraft Gamers,"This study investigated cognitive biases toward gaming-related words and differences in cognitive performance among twelve World of Warcraft players (WWP) and thirty non-players (NP). We measured response to valenced common English and WoW jargon words using a computer-based go/no-go task. Sometimes positive valence words were the targets for the 'go' response, with negative-valence words as the distracters, sometimes the reverse. Target discrimination (d′) and response disinhibition (C) were calculated using a signal detection analysis. Based on questionnaire responses, there were no differences between groups in depression, anxiety, smoking or drinking, but WWP reported significantly more screen and gaming time (17.31 h/week versus 4.12 among NP). WWP had faster reaction time (RT) and better discrimination of targets from distracters (high d′) but also showed higher disinhibition (low C). WWP also showed cognitive-bias toward game-related words in the form of higher d′ for WoW jargon than common English and more disinhibition to positive-valence WoW jargon. Similar to past studies which have found alcoholics to have cognitive biases toward alcohol-related words, WWP who play frequently showed cognitive biases toward words related to the World of Warcraft game. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

,"Cognitive Appraisals And Emotions Predict Cortisol And Immune Responses: A Meta-Analysis Of Acute Laboratory Social Stressors And Emotion Inductions. Psychological Bulletin, 135(6), 823–53.","Models of stress and health suggest that emotions mediate the effects of stress on health; yet meta-analytic reviews have not confirmed these relationships. Categorizations of emotions along broad dimensions such as valence (e.g., positive and negative affect) may obscure important information about the effects of specific emotions on physiology. Within the context of the integrated specificity model, we present a novel theoretical framework that posits that specific emotional responses associated with specific types of environmental demands influence cortisol and immune outcomes in a manner that would have likely promoted the survival of our ancestors. We analyzed experiments from 66 journal articles that directly manipulated social stress or emotions and measured subsequent cortisol or immune responses. Judges rated experiments for the extent to which participants would experience theoretically relevant cognition and affect clustered around five categories: (a) cognitive appraisals, (b) basic emotions, (c) rumination and worry, (d) social threat, and (e) global mood states. As expected, global mood states were unassociated with the effect sizes, whereas exemplars from the other categories were generally associated with effect sizes in the expected manner. The present research suggests that coping strategies that alter appraisals and emotional responses may improve long-term health outcomes. This might be especially relevant for stressors that are acute or imminent, threaten one's social status, or require extended effort.",doi,10.1037/a0016909,nagy2015,Psychological Bulletin,"Denson, T.

,Collaborative Framework Of An Intelligent Agent System For Efficient Logistics Transport Planning,"In modern logistics chain, planning system which been applied for supporting daily operations, is becoming more information-intensive and technologically-dependent. Due to the growing operational complexities, the planning system is not only required to focus on ensuring the feasibility of daily plan, but also be capable of manipulating conflict of interest (COI) by exploiting efficient negotiation. This paper addresses a challenge of hinterland transport planning caused by limited information sharing, lack of collaboration and COI. We design collaboration and decision-making mechanisms for the implementation of autonomous control by means of multi agent technology and hybrid heuristics. It aims at providing quality plan to achieve high level of performance and robustness in hinterland logistics. From a system point of view, a service oriented architecture is proposed to integrate agent paradigm with a web-based planning system. From an operational point of view, special attentions are paid on establishing multi-dimensional collaborations between different stakeholders under the support of game theoretic approach. Specifically, we define how planning activities are executed, which level of collaborations are incorporated and how benefits are achieved with a global point of view. Due to the NP-hard nature of the addressed problem, an integrated NGSA-II and simulated annealing algorithm is implemented for assisting decision making. The parameters associated with the algorithm are tuned based on the Taguchi method. Case and comparative study will be presented to validate the appropriateness and performance of the approach. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",doi,10.1016/j.cie.2016.12.044,Scopus,Computers and Industrial Engineering,"Feng F., Pang Y., Lodewijks G., Li W.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Colombian Children With Overweight And Obesity Need Additional Motivational Support At School To Perform Health-Enhancing Physical Activity,"Aims: The aim of this study is to investigate associations of screen-time and physical activity (PA) with self-efficacy for PA, intrinsic motivation to PA and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in Colombian schoolchildren from socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods, and to compare these variables among children with normal-weight (NW), overweight (OW) and obesity (OB). Methods: In 678 schoolchildren (age 10-14 years) screen-time (TV, video games, computer) and number of days being physically active ≥ 60 minutes were self-reported. Multi-item scales were used to assess self-efficacy to PA and intrinsic motivation to PA. The KIDSCREEN-27 was used to assess HRQoL. Results: Screen-time was associated with HRQoL in the school/learning environment dimension. Number of days being physically active was associated with self-efficacy for PA, intrinsic motivation for PA and with HRQoL concerning physical well-being, autonomy/parent relation and social support/peers. Group differences were found for days being physically active (OW = 2.8 and OB = 2.7 vs. NW = 3.3) but not for screen-time (NW = 5.0, OW = 4.7 and OB = 5.7 hrs d-1). OW and OB scored lower on intrinsic motivation to PA than NW (OW = 19.2 and OB = 17.9 versus NW = 20.1). All 3 groups differed in physical well-being scores (NW = 50.3, OW = 48.1, OB = 40.6, P < .001). Conclusions: Schoolchildren with overweight and obesity from socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods need additional motivational support to perform health-enhancing PA to experience higher physical well-being. © 2015 Human Kinetics, Inc.",doi,10.1123/jpah.2014-0024,Scopus,Journal of Physical Activity and Health,"Olaya-Contreras P., Bastidas M., Arvidsson D.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Colour Characterization Of Handheld Game Console Displays,"During recent years, research on colour vision has used traditional visual colorimeters, cathode ray tubes (CRT), and personal-computer controlled LCD-TFT screens to generate chromatic stimuli. We here explore the possibilities offered by a particular family of electronic devices whose use has lately been expanding rapidly, and which have one or more TFT screens and all the hardware needed for portable and autonomous use: handheld game consoles. We considered the different consoles available on the market, and as a result conducted an initial comparative study of two models - Sony PSP and Nintendo DS. As a result of this study, we checked the potential of using the Nintendo DS console, of which more than 100 million units have been sold worldwide. The results of our tests clearly indicated that it can be used as a tool in colour vision and physiological optics at the same technical level as CRT or TFT screens. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

,Comparison Of Acute Exercise Responses Between Conventional Video Gaming And Isometric Resistance Exergaming,"Exergaming is a relatively new type of entertainment that couples physical activity and video gaming. To date, research that has focused on the physiologic responses to exergaming has been focused exclusively on aerobic-type activities. The purpose of this project was to describe the acute exercise responses (i.e., oxygen uptake [V̇O2], heart rate, and rate of perceived exertion [RPE]) to exergaming using full-body isometric muscle resistance and to determine whether these responses are different during singleversus opponent-based play. Male subjects (n = 32) were randomly and equally divided into either an experimental (EXP) or control (CON) group. Acute exercise responses (V̇O2, heart rate, and RPE) were measured in all subjects during both soloand opponent-based video game play. Subjects in the EXP group played using a controller that relied on full-body isometric muscle resistance to manipulate the on-screen character, whereas CON subjects used a conventional handheld controller. During solo play, the EXP group exhibited significantly higher values for V̇O2 (9.60 ±0.50 mL/kg/min) and energy expenditure (3.50 ± 0.14 kcal/min) than the CON group (V̇O2 5.05 ± 0.16 mL/kg/min; energy expenditure 1.92 ± 0.07 kcal/min). These changes occurred with no significant differences in RPE or heart rate between the groups. These results suggest that whole-body isometric exergaming results in greater energy expenditure than conventional video gaming, with no increase in perceived exertion during play. This could have important implications regarding long-term energy expenditure in gamers. © 2010 National Strength and Conditioning Association.",doi,10.1519/JSC.0b013e3181bab4a8,Scopus,Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research,"Bonetti A.J., Drury D.G., Danoff J.V., Miller T.A.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Computer Game Play Reduces Intrusive Memories Of Experimental Trauma Via Reconsolidation-Update Mechanisms,"Memory of a traumatic event becomes consolidated within hours. Intrusive memories can then flash back repeatedly into the mind’s eye and cause distress. We investigated whether reconsolidation—the process during which memories become malleable when recalled—can be blocked using a cognitive task and whether such an approach can reduce these unbidden intrusions. We predicted that reconsolidation of a reactivated visual memory of experimental trauma could be disrupted by engaging in a visuospatial task that would compete for visual working memory resources. We showed that intrusive memories were virtually abolished by playing the computer game Tetris following a memory-reactivation task 24 hr after initial exposure to experimental trauma. Furthermore, both memory reactivation and playing Tetris were required to reduce subsequent intrusions (Experiment 2), consistent with reconsolidation-update mechanisms. A simple, noninvasive cognitive-task procedure administered after emotional memory has already consolidated (i.e., > 24 hours after exposure to experimental trauma) may prevent the recurrence of intrusive memories of those emotional events. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.",doi,10.1177/0956797615583071,Scopus,Psychological Science,"James E.L., Bonsall M.B., Hoppitt L., Tunbridge E.M., Geddes J.R., Milton A.L., Holmes E.A.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas

,Computerized Respiratory Muscle Training In Children With Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy,"The present study describes the use of simple video games for a 5-week regimen of respiratory muscle training in 15 patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) at various stages of the disease. The games were re-arranged to be operated and driven by the respiratory efforts of the patient and to incorporate accurate ventilation and time measurements. Improvement in respiratory performance was determined by maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV), maximal achieved ventilation (VEmax) during a progressive isocapnic hyperventilation manoeuvre (PIHV) and the PIHV duration. The actual training period was 23 ± 4 days (mean ±S.D.) at ventilatory effort of 46 ± 6% MVV, for 10±3 min day-1. Patients with moderate impairment of lung function tests (LFT) showed an improvement in MVV, V Emax, and duration of PIHV of 12 ± 7% (p &lt; 0.02), 53 ± 25% (p &lt; 0.001) 57 ± 21% (p &lt; 0.01), respectively. Improvements correlated with actual training time and ventilation level, %MVV, but negatively correlated with years of immobilization and with the initial MVV. We conclude that computerized respiratory games may be applied for breathing exercises and may improve respiratory performance in recently immobilized children with DMD who have moderate impairment of LFT. © 1994.",doi,10.1016/0960-8966(94)90026-4,Scopus,Neuromuscular Disorders,"Vilozni D., Bar-Yishay E., Gur I., Shapira Y., Meyer S., Godfrey S.",1994,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas

,Continuous Measurement Of Breaks In Presence: Psychophysiology And Orienting Responses,"Assessing presence using questionnaires can yield interesting insights into the user experience in virtual environments, but is also limited both in terms of reliability and validity. Breaks in presence (BIPs) are an interesting alternative, given that the researcher can assess them correctly. Prior studies on the psychophysiology of BIPs followed an exploratory approach by not providing a cognitive mechanism for BIPs and lacking in external validity. We argue that BIPs can be considered a special form of orienting responses involving both the real and the virtual world. In the first of the presented studies, we investigated which types of BIPs can be differentiated and to what degree they affect the user experience. In the second study, we modified a commercial video game by introducing the previously identified BIPs and recorded psychophysiological measurements. The results are in line with findings on orienting responses and should provide fertile ground for future research.

,"Cool, Callous And In Control: Superior Inhibitory Control In Frequent Players Of Video Games With Violent Content.","Research on the effects of media violence exposure has shown robust associations among violent media exposure, increased aggressive behavior, and decreased empathy. Preliminary research indicates that frequent players of violent video games may have differences in emotional and cognitive processes compared to infrequent or nonplayers, yet research examining the amount and content of game play and the relation of these factors with affective and cognitive outcomes is limited. The present study measured neural correlates of response inhibition in the context of implicit attention to emotion, and how these factors are related to empathic responding in frequent and infrequent players of video games with graphically violent content. Participants completed a self-report measure of empathy as well as an affective stop-signal task that measured implicit attention to emotion and response inhibition during electroencephalography. Frequent players had lower levels of empathy as well as a reduction in brain activity as indicated by P100 and N200/P300 event related potentials. Reduced P100 amplitude evoked by happy facial expressions was observed in frequent players compared to infrequent players, and this effect was moderated by empathy, such that low levels of empathy further reduced P100 amplitudes for happy facial expressions for frequent players compared to infrequent players. Compared to infrequent players, frequent players had reduced N200/P300 amplitude during response inhibition, indicating less neural resources were recruited to inhibit behavior. Results from the present study illustrate that chronic exposure to violent video games modulates empathy and related neural correlates associated with affect and cognition.",doi,10.1093/scan/nsx115,pubmed,Social cognitive and affective neuroscience,"Stockdale, Laura; Morrison, Robert G; Palumbo, Robert; Garbarino, James; Silton, Rebecca L",2017,NA,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Coordinated Pursuer Control Using Particle Filters For Autonomous Search-And-Capture,"In a real-world pursuit-evasion (PE) game, the pursuers often have a limited field-of-view of the evaders and thus are required to search for and detect the evaders before capturing them. This paper presents a unified framework and control algorithm using particle filters (PFs) for the coordination of multiple pursuers to search for and capture multiple evaders given the ability of PF to estimate highly non-Gaussian densities prevalent in search problems. The pursuer control problem is formulated as a stochastic control problem where global objectives function of both searching and capturing are common. To take the evaders' actions into account, an action measure (AM) is defined over the evaders' PDs is used to represent the probability that the evader may transit each state in the PD. The global objective functions for search and capture are then decomposed into local objective functions for unification through objective priority weights. Coordination between the pursuers takes place through the multi-sensor update where the observation likelihoods of all pursuers are used in the PF update stage. The control actions of each pursuer are then determined individually, based on the updated PDs given the objective weights, action measures as well as evader importance weights in the case of multiple evaders. The proposed algorithm is tested in three scenarios for its effectiveness. In addition, a parametric study on the average capture time against the initial variances of the target state uncertainty is conducted to test for robustness. Results show that the pursuers are able to capture all the evaders in each case with the capture time for the second and last scenario differing by only 2.9% implying firstly that under the proposed algorithm, the capture time is not proportional to the increase in the number of evaders and also suggested robustness and potential scalability of the proposed algorithm. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

,Corba-Based Analysis Of Multi Agent Behavior,"An agent is a computer software that is capable of taking independent action on behalf of its user or owner. It is an entity with goals, actions and domain knowledge, situated in an environment. Multiagent systems comprises of multiple autonomous, interacting computer software, or agents. These systems can successfully emulate the entities active in a distributed environment. The analysis of multiagent behavior has been studied in this paper based on a specific board game problem similar to the famous problem of GO. In this paper a framework is developed to define the states of the multiagent entities and measure the convergence metrics for this problem. An analysis of the changes of states leading to the goal state is also made. We support our study of multiagent behavior by simulations based on a CORBA framework in order to substantiate our findings. © 2005 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.",doi,10.1007/s11390-005-0013-5,Scopus,Journal of Computer Science and Technology,"Bhattacharya S., Banerjee A., Bandyopadhyay S.",2005,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Costs And Benefits Of Autonomy When Learning A Task: An Experimental Approach,"Previous findings suggested that the positive relationship between autonomy and learning outcomes (such as improved task performance) only holds up until a certain optimum level of autonomy has been reached. This assumption was investigated in an experimental study where 95 participants had to learn a computer task. During the learning phase, we manipulated autonomy, distinguishing among no, moderate, and full autonomy. The results revealed that, when learning a task, having autonomy is preferred to having no autonomy. However, increases in autonomy beyond a certain level (i.e., full versus moderate autonomy) will not yield additional advantages regarding the motivation to learn and learning outcomes, and may have disadvantages in terms of learning efficiency.

,Creating Stories For A Composite Form: Video Game Design As Frame Orchestration,"Storytelling in games in the early years of game studies was seen as being in conflict with gameplay. Departing from that debate, I argue that it is productive to see video games as a composite form supporting different frames for involvement. Against this backdrop the article reports an interview study with game developers, asking what it means to author stories for a composite form. The main results show that the developers do not see storytelling as the defining trait of video games, but as a component in a whole product. The developers display a specific gaze for how players shift their attention between frames. An important skill for the developers is to try to control these shifts in order to enforce the emotions they want the player to have. This specific skill is labelled framework orchestration. Stories are here but one of the tools the developers have at their disposal. © 2015 Intellect Ltd Article.",doi,10.1386/jgvw.7.3.279_1,Scopus,Journal of Gaming and Virtual Worlds,Linderoth J.,2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Cue Reactivity And Its Inhibition In Pathological Computer Game Players,"Despite a rising social relevance of pathological computer game playing, it remains unclear whether the neurobiological basis of this addiction-like behavioral disorder and substance-related addiction are comparable. In substance-related addiction, attentional bias and cue reactivity are often observed. We conducted a functional magnetic resonance study using a dot probe paradigm with short-presentation (attentional bias) and long-presentation (cue reactivity) trials in eight male pathological computer game players (PCGPs) and nine healthy controls (HCs). Computer game-related and neutral computer-generated pictures, as well as pictures from the International Affective Picture System with positive and neutral valence, served as stimuli. PCGPs showed an attentional bias toward both game-related and affective stimuli with positive valence. In contrast, HCs showed no attentional bias effect at all. PCGPs showed stronger brain responses in short-presentation trials compared with HCs in medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and anterior cingulate gyrus and in long-presentation trials in lingual gyrus. In an exploratory post hoc functional connectivity analyses, for long-presentation trials, connectivity strength was higher between right inferior frontal gyrus, which was associated with inhibition processing in previous studies, and cue reactivity-related regions (left orbitofrontal cortex and ventral striatum) in PCGPs. We observed behavioral and neural effects in PCGPs, which are comparable with those found in substance-related addiction. However, cue-related brain responses were depending on duration of cue presentation. Together with the connectivity result, these findings suggest that top-down inhibitory processes might suppress the cue reactivity-related neural activity in long-presentation trials. © 2012 Society for the Study of Addiction.",doi,10.1111/j.1369-1600.2012.00491.x,Scopus,Addiction Biology,"Lorenz R.C., Krüger J.-K., Neumann B., Schott B.H., Kaufmann C., Heinz A., Wüstenberg T.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Current Ways To Harvest Energy Using A Computer Mouse,"This paper deals with the idea of an energy harvesting (EH) system that uses the mechanical energy from finger presses on the buttons of a computer mouse by means of a piezomaterial (PVF2). The piezomaterial is placed in the mouse at the interface between the button and the body. This paper reviews the parameters of the PVF2 piezomaterial and tests their possible implementation into EH systems utilizing these types of mechanical interactions. The paper tests the viability of two EH concepts: a battery management system, and a semi-autonomous system. A statistical estimate of the button operations is performed for various computer activities, showing that an average of up to 3300 mouse clicks per hour was produced for gaming applications, representing a tip frequency of 0.91 Hz on the PVF2 member. This frequency is tested on the PVF2 system, and an assessment of the two EH systems is reviewed. The results show that fully autonomous systems are not suitable for capturing low-frequency mechanical interactions, due to the parameters of current piezomaterials, and the resulting very long startup phase. However, a hybrid EH system which uses available power to initiate the circuit and eliminate the startup phase may be explored for future studies. © Czech Technical University in Prague, 2014.",doi,10.14311/AP.2014.54.0019,Scopus,Acta Polytechnica,"Horvat F., Cekan M., Soltes L., Biath P., Hucko B., Jedinak I.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,"Death With A Story: How Story Impacts Emotional, Motivational, And Physiological Responses To First-Person Shooter Video Games","This study investigates how game playing experience changes when a story is added to a first-person shooter game. Dependent variables include identification, presence, emotional experiences and motivations. When story was present, game players felt greater identification, sense of presence, and physiological arousal. The presence of story did not affect self-reported arousal or dominance. This study clearly demonstrates that story is something that video game players enjoy; it helps involve them in the game play, makes them feel more immersed in the virtual environment, and keeps them aroused. The greater character identification may be especially worrisome, as past research has shown that justified media violence disinhibits actual aggression on the part of the audience.",doi,10.1093/hcr/30.3.361,Scopus,Human Communication Research,"Schneider E.F., Lang A., Shin M., Bradley S.D.",2004,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Deciding To Defect: The Effects Of Video-Game Violence On Cooperative Behavior.,"This experiment examined the effect of videogame violence on cooperative decision making. Participants (N = 48) were randomly assigned to play either a violent or a nonviolent version of the video game Doom™ in dyads. Following the video-game task, participants were separated and given an opportunity to choose to cooperate with their partner for mutual gain, withdraw from the interaction, or exploit their partner for their own benefit. Participants in the violent condition were significantly more likely to choose to exploit their partners than participants in the nonviolent condition.

,Design And Testing Of A Novel Interactive Playground Device,"The concept of an interactive playground was born out of the specific need to tackle increasing levels of childhood obesity in the UK. A worryingly high proportion of children are inactive, preferring to spend their leisure time playing sedentary computer games or other electronic gaming devices. To engage this specific user group, an interactive, whole-body outdoor play device was devised. The device is intended to promote 'stealth fitness' with an aim to improve user's reaction time, coordination, agility, and cardiovascular fitness. This paper describes the design and experimentation phases undertaken to develop the device from an initial concept to a final product. Fifteen healthy children completed an experimental study consisting of three 5-min sessions. Heart rate was continuously monitored and ratings of enjoyment, competence, and perceived exertion were recorded after each session. The results indicate that using the new device elicits a large cardiovascular response while providing high levels of enjoyment. © IMechE 2008.",doi,10.1243/09544054JEM952SC,Scopus,"Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part B: Journal of Engineering Manufacture","Hodgkins P., Caine M., Rothberg S., Spencer M., Mallison P.",2008,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Design Effectiveness Analysis Of A Media Literacy Intervention To Reduce Violent Video Games Consumption Among Adolescents: The Relevance Of Lifestyles Segmentation,"Background: Exposure to media violence might have detrimental effects on psychological adjustment and is associated with aggression-related attitudes and behaviors. As a result, many media literacy programs were implemented to tackle that major public health issue. However, there is little evidence about their effectiveness. Evaluating design effectiveness, particularly regarding targeting process, would prevent adverse effects and improve the evaluation of evidence-based media literacy programs. Objectives: The present research examined whether or not different relational lifestyles may explain the different effects of an antiviolence intervention program. Research design: Based on relational and lifestyles theory, the authors designed a randomized controlled trial and applied an analysis of variance 2 (treatment: experimental vs. control) × 4 (lifestyle classes emerged from data using latent class analysis: communicative vs. autonomous vs. meta-reflexive vs. fractured). Subjects: Seven hundred and thirty-five Italian students distributed in 47 classes participated anonymously in the research (51.3% females). Measures: Participants completed a lifestyle questionnaire as well as their attitudes and behavioral intentions as the dependent measures. Results: The results indicated that the program was effective in changing adolescents’ attitudes toward violence. However, behavioral intentions toward consumption of violent video games were moderated by lifestyles. Those with communicative relational lifestyles showed fewer intentions to consume violent video games, while a boomerang effect was found among participants with problematic lifestyles. Conclusion: Adolescents’ lifestyles played an important role in influencing the effectiveness of an intervention aimed at changing behavioral intentions toward the consumption of violent video games. For that reason, audience lifestyle segmentation analysis should be considered an essential technique for designing, evaluating, and improving media literacy programs. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.",doi,10.1177/0193841X16666196,Scopus,Evaluation Review,"Rivera R., Santos D., Brändle G., Cárdaba M.Á.M.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Designing Videogames To Improve Students' Motivation,"The use of new technical tools as a mean to increase the motivation and improve the education of students is an intriguing and pressing issue. Specifically, great interest has been shown in the use of videogames since they constitute a common leisure-time activity of many young students, a circumstance that shows their motivational, if not their educational, potential. In this paper we suggest that the design of videogames can be a very effective activity. To demonstrate this, we have used game design as a test-bed for an experience involving Computer Science and History students: interdisciplinary teams have cooperated in the design of a video-game on an historical theme. The experience has been repeated along three academic years. The students' motivation has been evaluated in the last 2 years, demonstrating that it is higher when they use the interdisciplinary design of videogames as a way of learning instead of traditional learning methods. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

,Detecting Emotional State Of A Child In A Conversational Computer Game,"The automatic recognition of user's communicative style within a spoken dialog system framework, including the affective aspects, has received increased attention in the past few years. For dialog systems, it is important to know not only what was said but also how something was communicated, so that the system can engage the user in a richer and more natural interaction. This paper addresses the problem of automatically detecting ""frustration"", ""politeness"", and ""neutral"" attitudes from a child's speech communication cues, elicited in spontaneous dialog interactions with computer characters. Several information sources such as acoustic, lexical, and contextual features, as well as, their combinations are used for this purpose. The study is based on a Wizard-of-Oz dialog corpus of 103 children, 7-14 years of age, playing a voice activated computer game. Three-way classification experiments, as well as, pairwise classification between polite vs. others and frustrated vs. others were performed. Experimental results show that lexical information has more discriminative power than acoustic and contextual cues for detection of politeness, whereas context and acoustic features perform best for frustration detection. Furthermore, the fusion of acoustic, lexical and contextual information provided significantly better classification results. Results also showed that classification performance varies with age and gender. Specifically, for the ""politeness"" detection task, higher classification accuracy was achieved for females and 10-11 years-olds, compared to males and other age groups, respectively. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.csl.2009.12.004,Scopus,Computer Speech and Language,"Yildirim S., Narayanan S., Potamianos A.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas

,Development Of The E-Baby Serious Game With Regard To The Evaluation Of Oxygenation In Preterm Babies: Contributions Of The Emotional Design,"The present study aimed to describe the development process of a serious game that enables users to evaluate the respiratory process in a preterm infant based on an emotional design model. The e-Baby serious game was built to feature the simulated environment of an incubator, in which the user performs a clinical evaluation of the respiratory process in a virtual preterm infant. The user learns about the preterm baby's history, chooses the tools for the clinical evaluation, evaluates the baby, and determines whether his/her evaluation is appropriate. The e-Baby game presents phases that contain respiratory process impairments of higher or lower complexity in the virtual preterm baby. Included links give the user the option of recording the entire evaluation procedure and sharing his/her performance on a social network. e-Baby integrates a Clinical Evaluation of the Preterm Baby course in the Moodle virtual environment. This game, which evaluates the respiratory process in preterm infants, could support a more flexible, attractive, and interactive teaching and learning process that includes simulationswith features very similar to neonatal unit realities, thus allowing more appropriate training for clinical oxygenation evaluations in at-risk preterm infants. e-Baby allows advanced user-technologyeducational interactions because it requires active participation in the process and is emotionally integrated.

,Differential Magnitude Coding Of Gains And Omitted Rewards In The Ventral Striatum,"Physiologic studies revealed that neurons in the dopaminergic midbrain of non-human primates encode reward prediction errors. It was furthermore shown that reward prediction errors are adaptively scaled with respect to the range of possible outcomes, enabling sensitive encoding for a large range of reward values. Congruently, neuroimaging studies in humans demonstrated that BOLD-responses in the ventral striatum encode reward prediction errors in similar fashion as dopaminergic midbrain neurons, suggesting that these BOLD-responses may be driven by dopaminergic midbrain activity. However, neuroimaging results are ambiguous with respect to the adaptive scaling of reward prediction errors, leading to the conjecture that under certain circumstances other than dopaminergic midbrain input may drive ventral striatal BOLD-responses. The goal of this study was to substantiate whether BOLD-responses in the ventral striatum rather respond to adaptively scaled reward prediction errors or absolute reward magnitude. In addition, we aimed to identify neuronal structures modulating activity in the ventral striatum. Sixteen healthy participants played a wheel of fortune game, where they could win three differently valued rewards while being scanned. BOLD-responses increased after gaining rewards; this gain was however independent of the absolute reward magnitude. In contrast BOLD-responses upon reward omission decreased with reward magnitude. A psychophysiological interaction analysis identified a cluster in the brainstem in proximity of the dorsal raphe nucleus, a cluster in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, and a cluster in the rostral cingulate zone. These clusters changed their connectivity with the ventral striatum in relation to the absolute reward magnitude in reward omission trials. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

,"Digital Game Violence And Direct Aggression In Adolescence: A Longitudinal Study Of The Roles Of Sex, Age, And Parent–Child Communication.","This study investigated the roles of sex, age, and parent–child communication in moderating the association between digital game violence and direct aggression in a two-year longitudinal study. Finnish 12- and 15-year-old adolescents (N = 316) participated in the follow-up survey. As hypothesized, digital game violence was linked to direct aggression both longitudinally and synchronously, and the link was moderated by parent–child communication in interaction with sex and age. Results suggest that the moderating role of parent–child communication changes with increasing age. Poor parent–child communication may be one of the factors in an adolescent's development that may strengthen the negative effects of digital game violence, but even good parent–child communication does not necessarily protect the adolescent in the long run.

,Digital Vertical Sync System,"A digital vertical synchronization system has been designed and implemented in I2L. It is a two-mode system, operating with standard NTSC signals or with nonstandard signals from cable systems, video games, and the like. Mode recognition is automatic, but forced-mode operation is possible in isolated field cases where necessary. When receiving standard signals, the circuit includes a fixed modulus divider for deriving the vertical sync pulses from the phase-locked horizontal oscillator, an out-of-phase detection circuit, and digital integration to delay rephasing for several fields. In the nonstandard mode, the system functions much as a conventional vertical oscillator, with field-by-field synchronization, automatic retrace initiation in the absence of a sync pulse, and noise immunity for a time following retrace. The I2L technology permits linear circuits to be included on the chip. Among these are a monostable multivibrator, a voltage regulator, and a circuit which processes the integrated composite sync to provide more reliable phasing information. Another processing circuit converts the vertical drive pulse to a ramp suitable for driving the vertical power amplifier. Extensive field testing indicates that the system performs as well as conventional systems for any degraded signal and is substantially better for most.

,Discrimination Learning Induced By Training With Identical Stimuli,"Sensory stimuli become easier to detect or distinguish with practice. It is generally assumed that the task-relevant stimulus dimension becomes increasingly more salient as a result of attentively performing the task at a level that is neither too easy nor too difficult. However, here we show improved auditory frequency discrimination following training with physically identical tones that were impossible to discriminate. We also show that learning transfers across tone frequencies and across modalities: training on a silent visuospatial computer game improved thresholds on the auditory discrimination task. We suggest that three processes are necessary for optimal perceptual learning: sensitization through exposure to the stimulus, modality- and dimension-specific attention, and general arousal. © 2006 Nature Publishing Group.",doi,10.1038/nn1787,Scopus,Nature Neuroscience,"Amitay S., Irwin A., Moore D.R.",2006,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Disgust Selectively Modulates Reciprocal Fairness In Economic Interactions,"We report two studies aimed at investigating the effects of distinct negative emotions on pairwise economic interactions. In the ultimatum game, a proposer offers a division of a sum of money to a responder who decides whether to accept the split, or reject and leave both players with nothing. In Experiment 1, we investigated whether induced disgust, as compared to sadness and neutral emotion, specifically influences responders' decisions to reject unfair proposals. In Experiment 2, we assessed whether the effects of disgust were selectively related to social contexts by contrasting interactions with a human partner with those involving a computer. Results showed that relative to being in a sad or neutral mood, induced feelings of disgust significantly increased rejection rates of unfair offers. Moreover, we found that when the partner was not responsible for the fairness violation, such as in the computer-offer condition, the disgust induction failed to affect participants' choices. We conclude by focusing on the hypothesis that disgust and social norm violations may share common computational components, both at a psychological and a neural level. © 2010 American Psychological Association.",doi,10.1037/a0017826,Scopus,Emotion,"Moretti L., di Pellegrino G.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Do Prospect-Based Emotions Enhance Believability Of Game Characters? A Case Study In The Context Of A Dice Game,"To endow game characters with more realistic affective behavior, the notion of prospect-based emotions plays an important role: recent literature suggests that emotional states of such agents should not only be triggered by present stimuli, but also by anticipation on future stimuli, and evaluation of past stimuli in the context of these anticipations. Within the current study, an extension of the belief-desire-intention (BDI) model with prospect-based emotions is proposed, and is evaluated with respect to its capabilities of enhancing believability of game characters. The model has been implemented in the modeling language LEADSTO. In addition, a game application has been developed, in which a user can play a two games (tic-tac-toe and a game of dice) against an agent that is equipped with the emotion-based model. An empirical evaluation indicates that the model significantly enhances the agent's believability, in particular concerning its involvement in the situation. © 2013 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/T-AFFC.2013.30,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing,"Bosse T., Zwanenburg E.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas

,Effect Of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Combined With Gait And Mobility Training On Functionality In Children With Cerebral Palsy: Study Protocol For A Double-Blind Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial,"Background: The project proposes three innovative intervention techniques (treadmill training, mobility training with virtual reality and transcranial direct current stimulation that can be safely administered to children with cerebral palsy. The combination of transcranial stimulation and physical therapy resources will provide the training of a specific task with multiple rhythmic repetitions of the phases of the gait cycle, providing rich sensory stimuli with a modified excitability threshold of the primary motor cortex to enhance local synaptic efficacy and potentiate motor learning.Methods/design: A prospective, double-blind, randomized, controlled, analytical, clinical trial will be carried out.Eligible participants will be children with cerebral palsy classified on levels I, II and III of the Gross Motor Function Classification System between four and ten years of age. The participants will be randomly allocated to four groups: 1) gait training on a treadmill with placebo transcranial stimulation; 2) gait training on a treadmill with active transcranial stimulation; 3) mobility training with virtual reality and placebo transcranial stimulation; 4) mobility training with virtual reality and active transcranial stimulation. Transcranial direct current stimulation will be applied with the anodal electrode positioned in the region of the dominant hemisphere over C3, corresponding to the primary motor cortex, and the cathode positioned in the supraorbital region contralateral to the anode. A 1 mA current will be applied for 20 minutes. Treadmill training and mobility training with virtual reality will be performed in 30-minute sessions five times a week for two weeks (total of 10 sessions). Evaluations will be performed on four occasions: one week prior to the intervention; one week following the intervention; one month after the end of the intervention;and 3 months after the end of the intervention. The evaluations will involve three-dimensional gait analysis, analysis of cortex excitability (motor threshold and motor evoked potential), Six-Minute Walk Test, Timed Up-and-Go Test, Pediatric Evaluation Disability Inventory, Gross Motor Function Measure, Berg Balance Scale, stabilometry, maximum respiratory pressure and an effort test.Discussion: This paper offers a detailed description of a prospective, double-blind, randomized, controlled, analytical, clinical trial aimed at demonstrating the effect combining transcranial stimulation with treadmill and mobility training on functionality and primary cortex excitability in children with Cerebral Palsy classified on Gross Motor Function Classification System levels I, II and III.

In the second experiment, participants were divided into four subgroups on the basis of Type A versus Type B coronary-prone behavior (measured on the structured interview) and on the basis of unidimensional versus multidimensional responding (measured by a complexity interview with stems of the sentence completion test). Type A coronary-prone behavior did not contribute to differences in visual-motor performance. More multidimensional persons exceeded their unidimensional counterparts, especially in the application of strategy. The extension of complexity theory approaches to simpler tasks is discussed. It is noted that the frequently voiced assumptions of Type A individuals-that their behavior style tends to lead to higher performance levels-is not supported. © 1985 American Psychological Association.",doi,10.1037/0022-3514.48.3.728,Scopus,Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,"Streufert S., Streufert S.C., Denson A.L.",1985,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Effects Of Outcome On The Covariance Between Risk Level And Brain Activity In Adolescents With Internet Gaming Disorder,"Individuals with internet gaming disorder (IGD) often have impaired risky decision-making abilities, and IGD-related functional changes have been observed during neuroimaging studies of decision-making tasks. However, it is still unclear how feedback (outcomes of decision-making) affects the subsequent risky decision-making in individuals with IGD. In this study, twenty-four adolescents with IGD and 24 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited and underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing the balloon analog risk task (BART) to evaluate the effects of prior outcomes on brain activity during subsequent risky decision-making in adolescents with IGD. The covariance between risk level and activation of the bilateral ventral medial prefrontal cortex, left inferior frontal cortex, right ventral striatum (VS), left hippocampus/parahippocampus, right inferior occipital gyrus/fusiform gyrus and right inferior temporal gyrus demonstrated interaction effects of group by outcome (P < 0.05, AlphaSim correction). The regions with interactive effects were defined as ROI, and ROI-based intergroup comparisons showed that the covariance between risk level and brain activation was significantly greater in adolescents with IGD compared with HCs after a negative outcome occurred (P < 0.05). Our results indicated that negative outcomes affected the covariance between risk level and activation of the brain regions related to value estimation (prefrontal cortex), anticipation of rewards (VS), and emotional-related learning (hippocampus/parahippocampus), which may be one of the underlying neural mechanisms of disadvantageous risky decision-making in adolescents with IGD. © 2016 The Authors",doi,10.1016/j.nicl.2016.10.024,Scopus,NeuroImage: Clinical,"Qi X., Yang Y., Dai S., Gao P., Du X., Zhang Y., Du G., Li X., Zhang Q.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Effects Of Pain And Audiovisual Stimulation On The Opioid-Induced Depression Of The Hypoxic Ventilatory Response,"Background: Normoxic and hypoxic ventilation are influenced by chemoreceptor and nonchemoreceptor drives. Although inhalational anesthetics blunt hypoxic ventilation, this effect is reversed by audiovisual stimulation but not by pain. Opioids reduce both normoxic and hypoxic ventilation, but their interaction with pain and audiovisual stimulation has not been fully reported. Methods: Isocapnic, acute hypoxic ventilatory responses (AHRs) were measured in 11 volunteers. AHR and normoxic ventilation were measured under the following conditions: (1) eyes closed, no audio stimulation (low wakefulness); (2) low wakefulness conditions plus painful thermal stimulation; and (3) playing a computer game (high wakefulness), each with and without remifentanil infusion. Results: The average (± SD) remifentanil dose was 0.035 ± 0.012 μg · kg-1 · min-1. Both normoxic and hypoxic ventilation were significantly reduced by the remifentanil infusion under all three conditions. The AHR values under low wakefulness conditions were 0.33 ± 0.19 and 0.89 ± 0.49 1 · min-1 · sat-1 with and without remifentanil, respectively (P &lt; 0.05). High wakefulness significantly increased AHR with and without remifentanil, whereas low wakefulness with pain did not. However, high wakefulness with remifentanil did not increase the AHR back to what was observed during low wakefulness without remifentanil. Conclusions: The computer game was a more potent stimulus than pain in countering the depressant effect of remifentanil on AHR. Although the effect of high wakefulness was more attenuated than was previously observed with respect to inhalational anesthetics, the significance of these findings is underlined by the more clinically relevant scenario of what is experienced in the face of opioid administration. © 2005 American Society of Anesthesiologists, Inc.

,"Effects Of Racing Games On Risky Driving Behaviour, And The Significance Of Personality And Physiological Data","Background Racing games have emerged as topselling products in the video and computer game industry. The effect of playing racing games on the inclination of gamers to take risks has been investigated. Method Two experiments were conducted. In experiment 1, the impact of personality traits on the effects of playing racing games on risk-taking inclination was examined. The Vienna Test System, which includes the Eysenck Personality Profile Test and the Vienna Risk- Taking Test, was used to measure risk-taking inclination and risk-taking while driving. Experiment 2 was designed and conducted to analyse the effects of different intensity levels of car racing games on risk-taking inclination, and to study the relationship between physiological data and risk-taking inclination. Physiological data on skin conductance, heart rate and blood pressure were measured with the NeuroDyne System. Results Participants playing a racing game were more inclined to take risks in critical road traffic situations than those playing a neutral game. The adventurousness dimension of the Eysenck Personality Profile Test correlated significantly positively with risk-taking inclination. More importantly, the effect of the intensity level of a racing game on risk-taking inclination was significant. The higher the intensity level of the racing game, the higher the risk-taking inclination while driving. The effect of intensity level of the racing game on skin conductance was significantly positive. Skin conductance correlated significantly positively with risk-taking inclination. Conclusions The effect of playing racing games on risk-taking inclination is linked to personality and physiological data. Some recommendations are proposed as a result of this study for racing game management. © 2015, BMJ Publishing Group.

,"Effects Of Realism On Extended Violent And Nonviolent Video Game Play On Aggressive Thoughts, Feelings, And Physiological Arousal","Previous research has shown that playing violent video game exposure can increase aggressive thoughts, aggressive feelings, and physiological arousal. This study compared the effects that playing a realistic violent, unrealistic violent, or nonviolent video game for 45 min has on such variables. For the purpose of this study, realism was defined as the probability of seeing an event in real life. Participants (N=74; 39 male, 35 female) played either a realistic violent, unrealistic violent, or nonviolent video game for 45 min. Aggressive thoughts and aggressive feelings were measured four times (every 15 min), whereas arousal was measured continuously. The results showed that, though playing any violent game stimulated aggressive thoughts, playing a more realistic violent game stimulated significantly more aggressive feelings and arousal over the course of play. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",doi,10.1002/ab.20279,Scopus,Aggressive Behavior,"Barlett C.P., Rodeheffer C.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,"Effects Of Songs With Prosocial Lyrics On Prosocial Thoughts, Affect, And Behavior","Previous research has shown that exposure to violent media increased aggression-related affect and thoughts, physiological arousal, and aggressive behavior as well as decreased prosocial tendencies. The present research examined the hypothesis that exposure to prosocial media promotes prosocial outcomes. Three studies revealed that listening to songs with prosocial (relative to neutral) lyrics increased the accessibility of prosocial thoughts, led to more interpersonal empathy, and fostered helping behavior.

,Effects Of Videogame Distraction Using A Virtual Reality Type Head-Mounted Display Helmet On Cold Pressor Pain In Children.,"OBJECTIVE: To test whether a head-mounted display helmet enhances the effectiveness of videogame distraction for children experiencing cold pressor pain. METHOD: Forty-one children, aged 6-14 years, underwent one or two baseline cold pressor trials followed by two distraction trials in which they played the same videogame with and without the helmet in counterbalanced order. Pain threshold (elapsed time until the child reported pain) and pain tolerance (total time the child kept the hand submerged in the cold water) were measured for each cold pressor trial. RESULTS: Both distraction conditions resulted in improved pain tolerance relative to baseline. Older children appeared to experience additional benefits from using the helmet, whereas younger children benefited equally from both conditions. The findings suggest that virtual reality technology can enhance the effects of distraction for some children. Research is needed to identify the characteristics of children for whom this technology is best suited.",doi,10.1093/jpepsy/jsn023,Scopus,Journal of pediatric psychology,"Dahlquist L.M., Weiss K.E., Clendaniel L.D., Law E.F., Ackerman C.S., McKenna K.D.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas

Type A subjects exhibited greater impatience than Type B subjects.

,Electrodermal Response In Gaming,"Steady improvements in technologies that measure human emotional response offer new possibilities for making computer games more immersive. This paper reviews the history of designs a particular branch of affective technologies that acquire electrodermal response readings from human subjects. Electrodermal response meters have gone through continual improvements to better measure these nervous responses, but still fall short of the capabilities of today's technology. Electrodermal response traditionally have been labor intensive. Protocols and transcription of subject responses were recorded on separate documents, forcing constant shifts of attention between scripts, electrodermal measuring devices and of observations and subject responses. These problems can be resolved by collecting more information and integrating it in a computer interface that is, by adding relevant sensors in addition to the basic electrodermal resistance reading to untangle (1) body resistance; (2) skin resistance; (3) grip movements; other (4) factors affecting the neural processing for regulation of the body. A device that solves these problems is presented and discussed. It is argued that the electrodermal response datastreams can be enriched through the use of added sensors and a digital acquisition and processing of information, which should further experimentation and use of the technology. © Copyright 2011 J.

,Elementary Approaches To The Teaching Of The Combinatorial Problem Of Rectangular Islands,"In this paper the problem of rectangular islands was investigated. We advocate that the topic is particularly suitable for teaching in different levels. First, the occurring problems are part of current mathematical research with still open problems. This could motivate our talented students for active autonomous problem solving and bring the groups of researchers, educators and students closer. The presented computer supported tools enable an emphasis shift from the frontal teaching to project based, self-paced or active small group learning. By manipulating the size of the grid, the water level, or the height of a cell with suitable graphical interface elements, the learner becomes an active part of the discovery and learning process. The introduced graphical representations can be studied dynamically and parallel with the interactive demonstrations and games designed by the authors. The concrete representations, and constructions can facilitate the discovery of patterns and can lead to invention of general conjectures. In fact, the authors of the paper ourselves found some results in 4.1-2.4 in this way. We computed values for several small fixed sized grids, detected patterns for establishing a recursion and finally resolved them. For the investigation of integer sequences there are built-in functions in computer algebra systems like Mathematica, or there is a web resource, an online encyclopedia for looking up interesting integer sequences by just knowing their first few entries (http://www.research.att.com/~njas/ sequences/). The experimental activity complements, but does not replace, the essential part of the mathematical activity: the rigorous theorem proving. For doing so, we used some elementary results from the theory of linear recurrences and graphs and applied induction and the method of two-sided estimation. We deduced the maximal number of islands in the rectangular grid with the latter techniques. We note that we are going to use the Theorema proving system (Windsteiger et al. 2006) for supporting the formulation of the predicates and functions of the island theory in a more formal language and for facilitating the computation and proving phase of the exploration with computers. It is noted that even if the obtained lower and upper bounds would have been different, the efforts for establishing those bounds are not in vain and there is no a priori guarantee that the exact solution has a nice closed form. In fact, if the number of triangular islands in a grid with size n is denoted by f(n), according to Horváth et al. (2009), it is ""only"" known that n2+3n 5 ≤ f (n) ≤ n2+9n+2 14 . The grid and cell model we have considered can also be a link between different disciplines. There are other examples requiring only m 9 n cells on a rectangular grid; for example, aij may mean a colour on a gray-scale (before we convert the picture to black and white), transparency (against X-rays), or melting temperature. The technique of gradual increase of the water level is applied successfully in medical image processing (Beucher and Lantuejoul 1979). This outlook may also motivate our students to consider mathematics not as an abstract sterile world, but rather as the general technique of systematic problem solving with real applications. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",doi,10.1007/s10758-010-9171-9,Scopus,International Journal of Computers for Mathematical Learning,"Máder A., Vajda R.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Emotional And Adrenocortical Regulation In Early Adolescence: Prediction By Attachment Security And Disorganization In Infancy,"The aim of the present study was to examine differences in emotion expression and emotion regulation in emotion-eliciting situations in early adolescence from a bio-psycho-social perspective, specifically investigating the influence of early mother-infant attachment and attachment disorganization on behavioural and adrenocortical responses. The sample consisted of 96 children of the Regensburg Longitudinal Study IV. At age 12 months, attachment security and disorganization were assessed in the Strange Situation. At age 12 years, the adolescents were observed together with their mother during a computer game (eliciting anger) and the ""Talk Show Task"" (eliciting fear). Analyses included self-ratings and mother-ratings of the adolescents' emotions (anger and fear), observations of the adolescents' emotional expression and emotional regulation (social regulation, effective regulation) as well as concurrent maternal emotional support. In addition, adrenocortical activity was assessed from saliva samples before and after observation. The findings revealed different patterns of social-emotional responses depending on early attachment security. Adolescents with secure infant attachment reported more anger, when anger was induced, were rated as less anxious by their mothers, and their emotion self-ratings were more similar to their mothers' ratings compared to adolescents with an early insecure attachment. An increased adrenocortical response was only found in the group of adolescents with attachment disorganization in infancy, especially with increased fear. © The Author(s) 2014.",doi,10.1177/0165025414520808,Scopus,International Journal of Behavioral Development,"Spangler G., Zimmermann P.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Emotional Conflict In Interpersonal Interactions,"Facial displays of emotions can help to infer the mental states of other individuals. However, the expectations we generate on the basis of people's emotions can mismatch their actual behaviour in certain circumstances, which generates conflict. In the present study, we explored the neural mechanisms of emotional conflict during interpersonal interactions. Participants had to accept or reject economic offers made by several partners who displayed emotional expressions. On every trial, a cue informed participants of whether they could trust the emotion of their partner or not. Trustworthy (low-conflict) partners with happy facial expressions were cooperative and those with angry expressions did not cooperate. Untrustworthy (high-conflict) partners, on the other hand, cooperated when their expression was angry and did not cooperate when they displayed a happy emotion. Behavioural responses were faster for trustworthy than for untrustworty partners. High-conflict partners activated the anterior cingulate and the anterior insula. In turn, trustworthy partners were associated with activations in the left precuneus. Our results suggest that the emotion displayed by another person affects our decision-making in social contexts. When emotional expressions are linked to their natural consequences, they engage ToM processes. In contrast, untrustworthy emotional expressions engage conflict-related brain regions. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.",doi,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.08.039,Scopus,NeuroImage,"Ruz M., Tudela P.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Emotional Expression In Simple Line Drawings Of A Robot's Face Leads To Higher Offers In The Ultimatum Game,"In the present study, we investigated whether expressing emotional states using a simple line drawing to represent a robot's face can serve to elicit altruistic behavior from humans. An experimental investigation was conducted in which human participants interacted with a humanoid robot whose facial expression was shown on an LCD monitor that was mounted as its head (Study 1). Participants were asked to play the ultimatum game, which is usually used to measure human altruistic behavior. All participants were assigned to be the proposer and were instructed to decide their offer within 1 min by controlling a slider bar. The corners of the robot's mouth, as indicated by the line drawing, simply moved upward, or downward depending on the position of the slider bar. The results suggest that the change in the facial expression depicted by a simple line drawing of a face significantly affected the participant's final offer in the ultimatum game. The offers were increased by 13% when subjects were shown contingent changes of facial expression. The results were compared with an experiment in a teleoperation setting in which participants interacted with another person through a computer display showing the same line drawings used in Study 1 (Study 2). The results showed that offers were 15% higher if participants were shown a contingent facial expression change. Together, Studies 1 and 2 indicate that emotional expression in simple line drawings of a robot's face elicits the same higher offer from humans as a human telepresence does. © 2017 Terada and Takeuchi.",doi,10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00724,Scopus,Frontiers in Psychology,"Terada K., Takeuchi C.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Emotional Response Of Internet Gaming Disorder Gamer Among Taiwan College Students,"National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan Internet is fast developed and widely used in the world. People use internet for variety purposes, and over one billion users played computer games, but some of them addicted to internet or online game which was called Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD). IGD was defined and suggested investigating through standard criteria proposed by DSM-5. The symptoms of IGD include preoccupation with online activity, withdrawal, tolerance, and escape or relief from a negative mood. Some studies and scales considered that emotion was one feature or assessment of internet addiction (IA). Emotion brings psychological and physiological information of IGD. This study aimed to investigate emotional responses of IGD. Fifty college subjects in Taiwan were recruited and participated in an emotional induced experiment. IGD gamers reported different emotional intensity and expressed different autonomic nervous activity (from HRV) than non-IGD gamers when watching online game films. The emotional feature of IGD is worthy to be further studied to assist the development of research and applications. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.",doi,10.1166/asl.2017.9012,Scopus,Advanced Science Letters,"Hsieh D.-L., Hsiao T.-C.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Empirically Building And Evaluating A Probabilistic Model Of User Affect,"We present a probabilistic model of user affect designed to allow an intelligent agent to recognise multiple user emotions during the interaction with an educational computer game. Our model is based on a probabilistic framework that deals with the high level of uncertainty involved in recognizing a variety of user emotions by combining in a Dynamic Bayesian Network information on both the causes and effects of emotional reactions. The part of the framework that reasons from causes to emotions (diagnostic model) implements a theoretical model of affect, the OCC model, which accounts for how emotions are caused by one's appraisal of the current context in terms of one's goals and preferences. The advantage of using the OCC model is that it provides an affective agent with explicit information not only on which emotions a user feels but also why, thus increasing the agent's capability to effectively respond to the users' emotions. The challenge is that building the model requires having mechanisms to assess user goals and how the environment fits them, a form of plan recognition. In this paper, we illustrate how we built the predictive part of the affective model by combining general theories with empirical studies to adapt the theories to our target application domain. We then present results on the model's accuracy, showing that the model achieves good accuracy on several of the target emotions. We also discuss the model's limitations, to open the ground for the next stage of the work, i.e., complementing the model with diagnostic information. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",doi,10.1007/s11257-009-9062-8,Scopus,User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction,"Conati C., MacLaren H.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Energy Expenditure And Affect Responses To Different Types Of Active Video Game And Exercise,"Background: The purpose of this study was to compare entertainment-themed active video game (AVG) and fitness-themed AVG play with traditional exercise to examine the interaction between physiological and psychological responses. Methods: Participants (N = 23) were randomly assigned to 30-min of (i) self-selected intensity exercise (SS-EX), (ii) moderate intensity exercise (MOD-EX), (iii) entertainment-themed video game (ET-VG) and (iv) fitness-themed video game (FT-VG). Physiological and psychological outcomes were recorded before, during and after each trial. Results: All trials met the ACSM criteria for moderate or vigorous physical activity. The % VO2R (68.3±13.9%) and rate of energy expenditure (10.3±3.1kcal/min) was significantly higher in the SS-EX trial with lowest values reported for ET-VG (p&lt;0.05). No differences were found in % heart rate reserve between SS-EX and FT-VG (66.9±12.5% and 67.1 ±6% respectively). The AVG's were significantly more enjoyable than the exercise trials (p&lt;0.05) and the ET-VG resulted in the highest core flow and psychological well-being (p&lt;0.05). Conclusion: AVG's can elicit physiological responses that meet recommended exercise intensities but are more enjoyable than conventional exercise in young inactive adults. While further work is required, this study highlights the importance of examining the interaction between physiological outcomes and psychological states to increase physical activity and reduce sedentary time. © 2017 Monedero et al.

,Estimating Whether Replacing Time In Active Outdoor Play And Sedentary Video Games With Active Video Games Influences Youth's Mental Health,"Purpose The primary objective was to use isotemporal substitution models to estimate whether replacing time spent in sedentary video games (SVGs) and active outdoor play (AOP) with active video games (AVGs) would be associated with changes in youth's mental health. Methods A representative sample of 20,122 Canadian youth in Grades 6–10 was studied. The exposure variables were average hours/day spent playing AVGs, SVGs, and AOP. The outcomes consisted of a negative and internalizing mental health indicator (emotional problems), a positive and internalizing mental health indicator (life satisfaction), and a positive and externalizing mental health indicator (prosocial behavior). Isotemporal substitution models estimated the extent to which replacing time spent in SVGs and AOP with an equivalent amount of time in AVGs had on the mental health indicators. Results Replacing 1 hour/day of SVGs with 1 hour/day of AVGs was associated with a 6% (95% confidence interval: 3%–9%) reduced probability of high emotional problems, a 4% (2%–7%) increased probability of high life satisfaction, and a 13% (9%–16%) increased probability of high prosocial behavior. Replacing 1 hour/day of AOP with 1 hour/day of AVGs was associated with a 7% (3%–11%) increased probability of high emotional problems, a 3% (1%–5%) reduced probability of high life satisfaction, and a 6% (2%–9%) reduced probability of high prosocial behavior. Conclusions Replacing SVGs with AVGs was associated with more preferable mental health indicators. Conversely, replacing AOP with AVGs was associated with more deleterious mental health indicators. © 2016 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine",doi,10.1016/j.jadohealth.2016.07.007,Scopus,Journal of Adolescent Health,Janssen I.,2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Ethical Aspects Of Brain Computer Interfaces: A Scoping Review.,"Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a set of technologies that are of increasing interest to researchers. BCI has been proposed as assistive technology for individuals who are non-communicative or paralyzed, such as those with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or spinal cord injury. The technology has also been suggested for enhancement and entertainment uses, and there are companies currently marketing BCI devices for those purposes (e.g., gaming) as well as health-related purposes (e.g., communication). The unprecedented direct connection created by BCI between human brains and computer hardware raises various ethical, social, and legal challenges that merit further examination and discussion. To identify and characterize the key issues associated with BCI use, we performed a scoping review of biomedical ethics literature, analyzing the ethics concerns cited across multiple disciplines, including philosophy and medicine. Based on this investigation, we report that BCI research and its potential translation to therapeutic intervention generate significant ethical, legal, and social concerns, notably with regards to personhood, stigma, autonomy, privacy, research ethics, safety, responsibility, and justice. Our review of the literature determined, furthermore, that while these issues have been enumerated extensively, few concrete recommendations have been expressed. We conclude that future research should focus on remedying a lack of practical solutions to the ethical challenges of BCI, alongside the collection of empirical data on the perspectives of the public, BCI users, and BCI researchers.",doi,10.1186/s12910-017-0220-y,pubmed,BMC medical ethics,"Burwell, Sasha; Sample, Matthew; Racine, Eric",2017,NA,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Evaluation Method Of Visual Induced Motion Sickness By Interactive Video Using Time-Variant Biosignals,"Objective evaluation methods of visual induced motion sickness (VIMS) caused by interactive video such as computer game is studied to clarify the relation between VIMS and image motion components. We focus on time-variant biosignal indices related autonomic nervous activity, and estimate availability of two indices called ∆ILF/HF based on LF/HF ratio and triggerpoints from heart rate signals. As a result of experiment by 20 subjects, the biosignal indices have positive correlation with the global motion of video in case of non-interactive video, whether unpleasant subjective score is low or high. In case of interactive video, on the other hand, both subjective score and triggerpoints by biosignal decrease compare to that of non-interactive video, and ∆ILF/HF indices tendency depends on the operation type of video in case of interactive video. These results suggest that triggerpoints indices are possible to use for evaluation of VIMS related by GMV, and ∆ILF/HF indices are possible to use unconscious VIMS effect in ANA level caused by video motion and operation rather than subjective unpleasant sensation. © 2011, The Institute of Image Electronics Engineers of Japan.

,"Evaluation Of The Emotional Education Program ""Happy 8-12"" For The Assertive Resolution Of Conflicts Among Peers","Introduction. Coexistence in schools inevitably implies conflicts among peers, which can have a negative impact inboth the students' well-being and their academic achievement. In this sense, the main objective of the present article is to introduce and describe the evaluation of the Training Program in Emotional Management Happy 8-12. This software focuses on the education of the pupils' emotional competences in order to solve conflicts in an assertive way. The program consists of 25 conflicts which students need to solve according to the management program of emotions developed by the Psychopedagogic Orientation Group (GROP). Method. The sample of the study consisted of 574 students of 5th and 6th grade of primary education. 301 of the participants were boys (52.4%) and 273 were girls (47.6%). Average age was 10.53, with a standard deviation of.662. The design employed in the present work was a quasi experimental design with pretest and posttest with a control group. The instruments and techniques used for the evaluation were: QDE, STAIC, CES, playground climate, anecdotic registration of conflict behaviours and academic performance. Results. Our results indicated that Happy 8-12 significantly improved the emotional competences of the students, reduced anxiety levels, and ameliorated the atmosphere in both the playground and in the class, noticeably augmenting the academic success. Conclusión. The results of this study show that training the management of emotions improves students' well-being at the same time that it acts as a preventive strategy for more severe disruptive behaviours, such as bullying. It also optimises the coexistence in the educative centres. © Education & Psychology I+D+i and Ilustre Colegio Oficial de la Psicología de Andalucía Oriental (Spain).",doi,10.14204/ejrep.40.15164,Scopus,Electronic Journal of Research in Educational Psychology,"Filella Guiu G., Cabello E., Pérez-Escoda N., Ros-Morente A.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas

,Evaluation Of Tv Commercials Using Neurophysiological Responses,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, neuroscientific knowledge has been applied to marketing as a novel and efficient means to comprehend the cognitive and behavioral aspects of consumers. A number of studies have attempted to evaluate media contents, especially TV commercials using various neuroimaging techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG). Yet neurophysiological examination of detailed cognitive and affective responses in viewers is still required to provide practical information to marketers. Here, this study develops a method to analyze temporal patterns of EEG data and extract affective and cognitive indices such as happiness, surprise, and attention for TV commercial evaluation.METHODS: Twenty participants participated in the study. We developed the neurophysiological indices for TV commercial evaluation using classification model. Specifically, these model-based indices were customized using individual EEG features. We used a video game for developing the index of attention and four video clips for developing indices of happiness and surprise. Statistical processes including one-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) and the cross validation scheme were used to select EEG features for each index. The EEG features were composed of the combinations of spectral power at selected channels from the cross validation for each individual. The Fisher's linear discriminant classifier (FLDA) was used to estimate each neurophysiological index during viewing four different TV commercials. Post hoc behavioral responses of preference, short-term memory, and recall were measured.RESULTS: Behavioral results showed significant differences for all preference, short-term memory rates, and recall rates between commercials, leading to a 'high-ranked' commercial group and a 'low-ranked' group (P < 0.05). Neural estimation of happiness results revealed a significant difference between the high-ranked and the low-ranked commercials in happiness index (P < 0.01). The order of rankings based on happiness and attention matched well with the order of behavioral response rankings. In the elapsed-time analysis of the highest-ranked commercial, we could point to visual and auditory semantic structures of the commercial that induced increases in the happiness index.CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that the neurophysiological indices developed in this study may provide a useful tool for evaluating TV commercials.",doi,10.1186/s40101-015-0056-4,Scopus,Journal of physiological anthropology,"Yang T., Lee D.-Y., Kwak Y., Choi J., Kim C., Kim S.-P.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Evaluation Of Virtual Reality Therapy In Augmenting The Physical And Cognitive Rehabilitation Of War Veterans,"War veterans with neuromuscularskeletal injury often require significant treatment and rehabilitation, straining health care resources. In a study funded by the Office of Naval Research and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Virtual Reality Medical Center is applying virtual reality (VR) therapy to injured military personnel at the Naval Medical Center San Diego. The goal of this study is to investigate whether augmenting traditional rehabilitation with VR (in this case, off-the-shelf interactive video games) will enable a more rapid and complete rehabilitation. Because VR is interactive and encourages patients to use the entire body to reach goals in the game, VR may make the rehabilitation sessions more comfortable and entertaining. The participants consist of 20 veterans with upper arm and shoulder injuries (rotator cuff tear, shoulder impingement, bursitis). The participants were divided into two groups (n = 10): an experimental group, which would receive traditional rehabilitation augmented by virtual reality therapy, and a control group, which would undergo traditional rehabilitation. The participants will complete ten treatment sessions in their respective condition. Although the study has not yet been completed, preliminary results based on subjective questionnaires and functional capacity indicate that the experimental condition can elicit increased heart rate and respiration. The participants in this group also seem to enjoy the music and interaction made possible through VR. The results suggest that VR can enhance the rehabilitation process, creating a more effective form of treatment. The long-term benefits of this form of treatment may include improved treatment time and reduced drop-out rates, therefore reducing the costs of rehabilitation. © 2006, by Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co.

,Excessive Computer Game Playing: Evidence For Addiction And Aggression?,"Computer games have become an ever-increasing part of many adolescents' day-to-day lives. Coupled with this phenomenon, reports of excessive gaming (computer game playing) denominated as ""computer/video game addiction"" have been discussed in the popular press as well as in recent scientific research. The aim of the present study was the investigation of the addictive potential of gaming as well as the relationship between excessive gaming and aggressive attitudes and behavior. A sample comprising of 7069 gamers answered two questionnaires online. Data revealed that 11.9% of participants (840 gamers) fulfilled diagnostic criteria of addiction concerning their gaming behavior, while there is only weak evidence for the assumption that aggressive behavior is interrelated with excessive gaming in general. Results of this study contribute to the assumption that also playing games without monetary reward meets criteria of addiction. Hence, an addictive potential of gaming should be taken into consideration regarding prevention and intervention.",doi,10.1089/cpb.2006.9956,anderson2010,CyberPsychology & Behavior,"Grusser, S.

,Excessive Users Of Violent Video Games Do Not Show Emotional Desensitization: An Fmri Study,"Playing violent video games have been linked to long-term emotional desensitization. We hypothesized that desensitization effects in excessive users of violent video games should lead to decreased brain activations to highly salient emotional pictures in emotional sensitivity brain regions. Twenty-eight male adult subjects showing excessive long-term use of violent video games and age and education matched control participants were examined in two experiments using standardized emotional pictures of positive, negative and neutral valence. No group differences were revealed even at reduced statistical thresholds which speaks against desensitization of emotion sensitive brain regions as a result of excessive use of violent video games. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",doi,10.1007/s11682-016-9549-y,Scopus,Brain Imaging and Behavior,"Szycik G.R., Mohammadi B., Hake M., Kneer J., Samii A., Münte T.F., te Wildt B.T.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Exclusion And Micro-Rejection: Event-Related Potential Response Predicts Mitigated Distress,"We studied time-based neural activity with event-related potentials (ERPs) in young adults during a computer-simulated ball-toss game. Experiencing fair play initially, participants were ultimately excluded by other players. Dense-array ERPs showed time-dependent associations between slow-wave activity (580-900 ms) in left prefrontal/medial frontal cortical regions for exclusion events and self-reported distress. More subtle 'micro-rejections' during fair play showed a similar distress to ERP association (420-580 ms). In both cases, greater positive amplitude neural activity was associated with less post-exclusion distress. Findings suggest that rapidly occurring neural responses to social exclusion events are linked to individual differences in ostracism-related distress. Relations emerged even during fair play, providing a window into the neural basis of more subtle social-cognitive perceptual processes. © 2009 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",doi,10.1097/WNR.0b013e328330377a,Scopus,NeuroReport,"Crowley M.J., Wu J., McCarty E.R., David D.H., Bailey C.A., Mayes L.C.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Exercise Intensity Levels In Children With Cerebral Palsy While Playing With An Active Video Game Console,"Background. Children with cerebral palsy (CP) are prone to secondary complications related to physical inactivity and poor cardiorespiratory capacity. This problem could be greatly attenuated through the use of video games that incorporate physical activity for 2 reasons: Video games already represent an important component of leisure time in younger people, and such games can lead to a high level of exercise intensity in people who are healthy. Objective. The study objective was to evaluate exercise intensity in children with spastic diplegic CP and children who were typically developing while playing with an active video game console. Design. This was a cross-sectional study. Methods. Ten children (7-12 years old) with spastic diplegic CP (Gross Motor Function Classification System level I or II) and 10 children who were age matched and typically developing were evaluated in a movement analysis laboratory. Four games were played with the active video game console (jogging, bicycling, snowboarding, and skiing) for 40 minutes. Heart rate was recorded during the entire playing period with a heart rate belt monitor. Exercise intensity was defined as the percentage of heart rate reserve (HRR). In addition, lower extremity motion analysis was carried out during the final minute of the playing period for the jogging and bicycling games. Results. No difference between groups was observed for any variables. A main effect of games was observed for the amount of time spent at an intensity greater than 40% of HRR. Specifically, more than 50% of the playing time for the jogging game and more than 30% of the playing time for the bicycling game were spent at an intensity greater than 40% of HRR. In addition, the jogging game produced a larger range of motion than the bicycling game. Limitations. A limitation of this study was the relatively small and heterogeneous sample. Conclusions. For all 4 games, similar exercise intensity levels were observed for children who were typically developing and children with CP, suggesting that children with CP could obtain exercise-related benefits similar to those obtained by children without CP while playing with an active video game console. © 2013 American Physical Therapy Association.",doi,10.2522/ptj.20120204,Scopus,Physical Therapy,"Robert M., Ballaz L., Hart R., Lemay M.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Exergaming Can Be An Innovative Way Of Enjoyable High-Intensity Interval Training.,"Exergames can replace sedentary time spent on computer gaming with physical activity. Previous research has found exergaming to elicit light-to-moderate exercise intensity. Our primary aim was to examine the exercise intensity of a newly developed biking exergame. Eight males (23.9±0.6 years) played the exergame (PLAY) and walked (WALK) on three separate occasions, with the condition counterbalanced and in random sequence within each day. They were asked to PLAY and WALK for a minimum of 15 min and then continue for as long as they wanted. We measured heart rate (HR), activity duration, caloric expenditure and subject-rated exertion and enjoyment (based on 0-10 Visual Analogue Scale, VAS). We used an average of each outcome variable across the 3 days in the analysis. The average intensity during PLAY (73%±10% of HRmax) was significantly higher than that during WALK (57%±7% of HRmax, p=0.01). Participants spent 12.5±5.3 min at 80%-89% of HRmax and 5.5±4.6 min at ≥90% of HRmax during PLAY, whereas intensity during WALK was ≤72% of HRmax. The duration of PLAY was 44.3±0.7 min and of WALK 17.0±0.7 min (p=0.01). The relative energy expenditure during PLAY was 7.6±0.7 kcal/min and during WALK 6.2±0.3 kcal/min (p<0.01). The enjoyment of PLAY (VAS 8.7±0.1) was higher than that of WALK (VAS 3.9±1.8, p=0.01). Exergaming can be an innovative way of enjoyable high-intensity training.",doi,10.1136/bmjsem-2017-000258,pubmed,BMJ open sport &amp; exercise medicine,"Moholdt, Trine; Weie, Stian; Chorianopoulos, Konstantinos; Wang, Alf Inge; Hagen, Kristoffer",2017,NA,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Exergaming To Increase The Exercise Capacity And Daily Physical Activity In Heart Failure Patients: A Pilot Study,"Background: Regular daily physical activity is recognised as important in heart failure (HF) patients, but adherence to physical activity is low (<50%). To improve adherence to exercise in HF patients, alternative approaches to motivate and increase self-efficacy to exercise are needed. Therefore, we have studied a new phenomenon: exergames (games to improve physical exercise). The aims of the study were to assess the influence of the exergame platform Nintendo Wii on exercise capacity and daily physical activity in heart failure patients, to study factors related to exercise capacity and daily physical activity, and to assess patients' adherence to exergaming. Methods: A 12-week pilot study with a pretest-posttest design was conducted. The intervention consisted of an instruction on how to use the Wii and 12 weeks' access to Wii at home. The main variables tested were exercise capacity (measured with a six-minute walking test), daily physical activity (measured with an activity monitor), and time exergaming (daily self-report with a diary). Bivariate correlations were used to assess associations between symptom experience, self-efficacy, motivation, anxiety, and depression. Results: In total, 32 heart failure patients were included. More than half of the patients (53%) significantly increased their exercise capacity after 12 weeks. No significant difference was found in daily physical activity between baseline and 12 weeks. Lower NYHA class and shorter time since diagnosis were factors significantly related to the increase in exercise capacity. The daily mean time spent exergaming was 28 minutes, and having grandchildren and being male were related to more time spent exergaming. Conclusion: Exergaming has the potential to increase exercise capacity in elderly, chronically ill cardiac patients. Although the daily physical activity did not change over time, exergaming was feasible for heart failure patients and might be a rehabilitation option for patients with heart failure. © 2014 Klompstra et al.",doi,10.1186/1471-2318-14-119,Scopus,BMC Geriatrics,"Klompstra L., Jaarsma T., Strömberg A.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Experience Assessment And Design In The Analysis Of Gameplay,"We report research on player modeling using psychophysiology and machine learning, conducted through interdisciplinary collaboration between researchers of computer science, psychology, and game design at Aalto University, Helsinki. First, we propose the Play Patterns And eXperience (PPAX) framework to connect three levels of game experience that previously had remained largely unconnected: game design patterns, the interplay of game context with player personality or tendencies, and state-of-the-art measures of experience (both subjective and non-subjective). Second, we describe our methodology for using machine learning to categorize game events to reveal corresponding patterns, culminating in an example experiment. We discuss the relation between automatically detected event clusters and game design patterns, and provide indications on how to incorporate personality profiles of players in the analysis. This novel interdisciplinary collaboration combines basic psychophysiology research with game design patterns and machine learning, and generates new knowledge about the interplay between game experience and design. © 2013 SAGE Publications.",doi,10.1177/1046878113513936,Scopus,Simulation and Gaming,"Cowley B., Kosunen I., Lankoski P., Kivikangas J.M., Järvelä S., Ekman I., Kemppainen J., Ravaja N.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Experimental Study Of The Differential Effects Of Playing Versus Watching Violent Video Games On Children’s Aggressive Behavior.,"There is great concern about the effects of playing violent video games on aggressive behavior. The present experimental study was aimed at investigating the differential effects of actively playing vs. passively watching the same violent video game on subsequent aggressive behavior. Fifty-seven children aged 10–13 either played a violent video game (active violent condition), watched the same violent video game (passive violent condition), or played a non-violent video game (active non-violent condition). Aggression was measured through peer nominations of real-life aggressive incidents during a free play session at school. After the active participation of actually playing the violent video game, boys behaved more aggressively than did the boys in the passive game condition. For girls, game condition was not related to aggression. These findings indicate that, specifically for boys, playing a violent video game should lead to more aggression than watching television violence. Aggr.

,Exploiting Agents For Modelling And Simulation Of Coverage Control Protocols In Large Sensor Networks,"A sensor network is composed of low-cost, low-power nodes densely deployable over a (possibly in-hospitable) territory in order to monitor the state of the environment, e.g. temperature, sound, radiation and so forth. Sensors have the ability to self-organize into an interconnected network and to cooperate for collecting, aggregating and disseminating information to end users. Major challenges in dealing with sensor networks are the strong limitations imposed by finite onboard power capacity. This paper proposes a lightweight actor infrastructure that is well-suited to modelling and simulation of complex sensor networks and, more in general, of multi-agent systems. This infrastructure is exploited for designing and implementing an efficient actor-based distributed simulation model for studying specific aspects of large wireless sensor networks. The paper proposes and compares the performances of two protocols for the coverage control problem that achieve their objective as an emergent property. In particular, one of the two protocols adopts a novel approach based on an evolutionary game. Distributed simulation of the achieved actor-based models is characterized by good execution performances witnessed by reported experimental results. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

,Exposure To Hot And Cold Environmental Conditions Does Not Affect The Decision Making Ability Of Soccer Referees Following An Intermittent Sprint Protocol,"Soccer referees enforce the laws of the game and the decisions they make can directly affect match results. Fixtures within European competitions take place in climatic conditions that are often challenging (e.g., Moscow ~ -5°C, Madrid ~30°C). Effects of these temperatures on player performance are well-documented; however, little is known how this environmental stress may impair cognitive performance of soccer referees and if so, whether exercise exasperates this. The present study aims to investigate the effect of cold [COLD; -5°C, 40% relative humidity (RH)], hot (HOT; 30°C, 40% RH) and temperate (CONT; 18°C, 40% RH) conditions on decision making during soccer specific exercise. On separate occasions within each condition, 13 physically active males; either semi-professional referees or semi-professional soccer players completed three 90 min intermittent treadmill protocols that simulated match play, interspersed with 4 computer delivered cognitive tests to measure vigilance and dual task capacity. Core and skin temperature, heart rate, rating of perceived exertion (RPE) and thermal sensation (TS) were recorded throughout the protocol. There was no significant difference between conditions for decision making in either the dual task (interaction effects: FALSE p = 0.46; MISSED p = 0.72; TRACKING p = 0.22) or vigilance assessments (interaction effects: FALSE p = 0.31; HIT p = 0.15; MISSED p = 0.17) despite significant differences in measured physiological variables (skin temperature: HOT vs. CONT 95% CI = 2.6 to 3.9, p < 0.001; HOT vs. COLD 95% CI = 6.6 to 9.0, p < 0.001; CONT vs. COLD 95% CI = 3.4 to 5.7, p < 0.01). It is hypothesized that the lack of difference observed in decision making ability between conditions was due to the exercise protocol used, as it may not have elicited an appropriate and valid soccer specific internal load to alter cognitive functioning. © 2014 Taylor, Fitch, Castle, Watkins, Aldous, Sculthorpe, Midgely, Brewer and Mauger.",doi,10.3389/fphys.2014.00185,Scopus,Frontiers in Physiology,"Taylor L., Fitch N., Castle P., Watkins S., Aldous J., Sculthorpe N., Midgely A., Brewer J., Mauger A.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Exposure To Violent Video Games And Aggression In German Adolescents: A Longitudinal Analysis.,"The relationship between exposure to violent electronic games and aggressive cognitions and behavior was examined in a longitudinal study. A total of 295 German adolescents completed the measures of violent video game usage, endorsement of aggressive norms, hostile attribution bias, and physical as well as indirect/relational aggression cross-sectionally, and a subsample of N=143 was measured again 30 months later. Cross-sectional results at T1 showed a direct relationship between violent game usage and aggressive norms, and an indirect link to hostile attribution bias through aggressive norms. In combination, exposure to game violence, normative beliefs, and hostile attribution bias predicted physical and indirect/relational aggression. Longitudinal analyses using path analysis showed that violence exposure at T1 predicted physical (but not indirect/relational) aggression 30 months later, whereas aggression at T1 was unrelated to later video game use. Exposure to violent games at T1 influenced physical (but not indirect/relational) aggression at T2 via an increase of aggressive norms and hostile attribution bias. The findings are discussed in relation to social-cognitive explanations of long-term effects of media violence on aggression. Aggr.

,Extending Self-Organizing Particle Systems To Problem Solving,"Self-organizing particle systems consist of numerous autonomous, purely reflexive agents (""particles"") whose collective movements through space are determined primarily by local influences they exert upon one another. Inspired by biological phenomena (bird flocking, fish schooling, etc.), particle systems have been used not only for biological modeling, but also increasingly for applications requiring the simulation of collective movements such as computer-generated animation. In this research, we take some first steps in extending particle systems so that they not only move collectively, but also solve simple problems. This is done by giving the individual particles (agents) a rudimentary intelligence in the form of a very limited memory and a top-down, goal-directed control mechanism that, triggered by appropriate conditions, switches them between different behavioral states and thus different movement dynamics. Such enhanced particle systems are shown to be able to function effectively in performing simulated search-and-collect tasks. Further, computational experiments show that collectively moving agent teams are more effective than similar but independently moving ones in carrying out such tasks, and that agent teams of either type that split off members of the collective to protect previously acquired resources are most effective. This work shows that the reflexive agents of contemporary particle systems can readily be extended to support goal-directed problem solving while retaining their collective movement behaviors. These results may prove useful not only for future modeling of animal behavior, but also in computer animation, coordinated movement control in robotic teams, particle swarm optimization, and computer games. © 2004 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",doi,10.1162/1064546041766424,Scopus,Artificial Life,"Rodríguez A., Reggia J.A.",2004,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Facial Expression Of Emotion And Perception Of The Uncanny Valley In Virtual Characters,"With technology allowing for increased realism in video games, realistic, human-like characters risk falling into the Uncanny Valley. The Uncanny Valley phenomenon implies that virtual characters approaching full human-likeness will evoke a negative reaction from the viewer, due to aspects of the character's appearance and behavior differing from the human norm. This study investigates if ""uncanniness"" is increased for a character with a perceived lack of facial expression in the upper parts of the face. More important, our study also investigates if the magnitude of this increased uncanniness varies depending on which emotion is being communicated. Individual parameters for each facial muscle in a 3D model were controlled for the six emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness and surprise in addition to a neutral expression. The results indicate that even fully and expertly animated characters are rated as more uncanny than humans and that, in virtual characters, a lack of facial expression in the upper parts of the face during speech exaggerates the uncanny by inhibiting effective communication of the perceived emotion, significantly so for fear, sadness, disgust, and surprise but not for anger and happiness. Based on our results, we consider the implications for virtual character design. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

,Facing The Challenge Of Teaching Emotions To Individuals With Low- And High-Functioning Autism Using A New Serious Game: A Pilot Study,"Background: It is widely accepted that emotion processing difficulties are involved in Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC). An increasing number of studies have focused on the development of training programs and have shown promising results. However, most of these programs are appropriate for individuals with high-functioning ASC (HFA) but exclude individuals with low-functioning ASC (LFA). We have developed a computer-based game called JeStiMulE based on logical skills to teach emotions to individuals with ASC, independently of their age, intellectual, verbal and academic level.The aim of the present study was to verify the usability of JeStiMulE (which is its adaptability, effectiveness and efficiency) on a heterogeneous ASC group. We hypothesized that after JeStiMulE training, a performance improvement would be found in emotion recognition tasks. Methods. A heterogeneous group of thirty-three children and adolescents with ASC received two one-hour JeStiMulE sessions per week over four weeks. In order to verify the usability of JeStiMulE, game data were collected for each participant. Furthermore, all participants were presented before and after training with five emotion recognition tasks, two including pictures of game avatars (faces and gestures) and three including pictures of real-life characters (faces, gestures and social scenes). Results: Descriptive data showed suitable adaptability, effectiveness and efficiency of JeStiMulE. Results revealed a significant main effect of Session on avatars (ANOVA: F (1,32) = 98.48, P <.001) and on pictures of real-life characters (ANOVA: F (1,32) = 49.09, P <.001). A significant Session × Task × Emotion interaction was also found for avatars (ANOVA: F (6,192) = 2.84, P =.01). This triple interaction was close to significance for pictures of real-life characters (ANOVA: F (12,384) = 1.73, P =.057). Post-hoc analyses revealed that 30 out of 35 conditions found a significant increase after training. Conclusions: JeStiMulE appears to be a promising tool to teach emotion recognition not only to individuals with HFA but also those with LFA. JeStiMulE is thus based on ASC-specific skills, offering a model of logical processing of social information to compensate for difficulties with intuitive social processing. Trial registration.

,Fairness In Multi-Agent Systems,"Multi-agent systems are complex systems in which multiple autonomous entities, called agents, cooperate in order to achieve a common or personal goal. These entities may be computer software, robots, and also humans. In fact, many multi-agent systems are intended to operate in cooperation with or as a service for humans. Typically, multi-agent systems are designed assuming perfectly rational, self-interested agents, according to the principles of classical game theory. Recently, such strong assumptions have been relaxed in various ways. One such way is explicitly including principles derived from human behavior. For instance, research in the field of behavioral economics shows that humans are not purely self-interested. In addition, they strongly care about fairness. Therefore, multi-agent systems that fail to take fairness into account, may not be sufficiently aligned with human expectations and may not reach intended goals. In this paper, we present an overview of work in the area of fairness in multi-agent systems. More precisely, we first look at the classical agent model, that is, rational decision making. We then provide an outline of descriptive models of fairness, that is, models that explain how and why humans reach fair decisions. Then, we look at prescriptive, computational models for achieving fairness in adaptive multi-agent systems. We show that results obtained by these models are compatible with experimental and analytical results obtained in the field of behavioral economics. © 2008 Copyright Cambridge University Press 2008.",doi,10.1017/S026988890800132X,Scopus,Knowledge Engineering Review,"De Jong S., Tuyls K., Verbeeck K.",2008,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Feasibility Study Of The Brightbrainer™ Integrative Cognitive Rehabilitation System For Elderly With Dementia,"Purpose: To describe the development of BrightBrainer™ integrative cognitive rehabilitation system and determine clinical feasibility with nursing home-bound dementia patients. Method: BrightBrainer cognitive rehabilitation simulations were first played uni-manually, then bimanually. Participants sat in front of a laptop and interacted through a game controller that measured hand movements in 3D, as well as flexion of both index fingers. Interactive serious games were designed to improve basic and complex attention (concentration, short-term memory, dual tasking), memory recall, executive functioning and emotional well-being. Individual simulations adapted automatically to each participant's level of motor functioning. The system underwent feasibility trials spanning 16 sessions over 8 weeks. Participants were evaluated pre- and post-intervention, using standardized neuropsychological measures. Computerized measures of movement repetitions and task performance were stored on a remote server. Results: Group analysis for 10 participants showed statistically significant improvement in decision making (p<0.01), with trend improvements in depression (p<0.056). Improvements were also seen in processing speed (p<0.13) and auditory attention (p<0.17); however, these were not statistically significant (partly attributable to the modest sample size). Eight of nine neuropsychological tests showed changes in the improvement direction indicating an effective rehabilitation (p<0.01). BrightBrainer technology was well tolerated with mean satisfaction ratings of 4.9/5.0 across participants. Conclusions: Preliminary findings demonstrate utility within an advanced dementia population, suggesting that it will be beneficial to evaluate BrightBrainer through controlled clinical trials and to investigate its application in other clinical populations.Implications for RehabilitationIt is possible to improve cognitive function in older low-functioning patients. Integrative rehabilitation through games combining cognitive (memory, focusing, executive function) and physical (bimanual whole arm movement, grasping, task sequencing) elements is enjoyable for this population.The severity of depression in these elderly can be reduced through virtual reality bimanual games.The number of upper extremity active repetitions performed in the process of solving cognitive problems with the BrightBrainer™ system is 600. This number is 18 times (1875%) larger than those observed by other researchers in conventional physical or occupational rehabilitation sessions. © 2014 Informa UK Ltd.",doi,10.3109/17483107.2014.900575,Scopus,Disability and Rehabilitation: Assistive Technology,"Burdea G., Polistico K., Krishnamoorthy A., House G., Rethage D., Hundal J., Damiani F., Pollack S.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,"Feasibility, Design And Conduct Of A Pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trial To Reduce Overweight And Obesity In Children: The Electronic Games To Aid Motivation To Exercise (Egame) Study","Background: Childhood obesity has reached epidemic proportions in developed countries. Sedentary screen-based activities such as video gaming are thought to displace active behaviors and are independently associated with obesity. Active video games, where players physically interact with images onscreen, may have utility as a novel intervention to increase physical activity and improve body composition in children. The aim of the Electronic Games to Aid Motivation to Exercise (eGAME) study is to determine the effects of an active video game intervention over 6 months on: body mass index (BMI), percent body fat, waist circumference, cardio-respiratory fitness, and physical activity levels in overweight children. Methods/Design: Three hundred and thirty participants aged 10-14 years will be randomized to receive either an active video game upgrade package or to a control group (no intervention). Discussion: An overview of the eGAME study is presented, providing an example of a large, pragmatic randomized controlled trial in a community setting.

,Feeling The Need For (Personalized) Speed: How Natural Controls And Customization Contribute To Enjoyment Of A Racing Game Through Enhanced Immersion,"Prior research suggests that video game features that appear natural or that otherwise allow players to identify with their in-game experience will promote enjoyment. Using a 2×2 experiment, this study demonstrates the positive effects of a steering-wheel controller and the opportunity to customize the driven vehicle on enjoyment of a console driving game, as mediated by transportation and challenge-skill balance. The role of presence is also probed, with results suggesting no direct link to enjoyment. © 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",doi,10.1089/cyber.2012.0025,Scopus,"Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking","Schmierbach M., Limperos A.M., Woolley J.K.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,"For Distinguished Early Career Contribution To Psychophysiology: Award Address, 1988: Individual Differences In Heart Rate Response During Behavioral Challenge","This program of experiments examined heart rate responses to mental arithmetic and a video game. Attention first focused on their metabolic relevance. Comparison with heart rate/oxygen consumption regression equations generated from isotonic exercise data revealed that the heart rate increases of certain individuals were considerably in excess of those necessitated by contemporary metabolic demand. Both temporal and intertask consistency of reaction were explored, and supportive evidence was obtained. The relationship between laboratory and real‐world reactions was investigated, and preliminary evidence found suggesting that in‐laboratory responses are indicative of responses to more naturalistic stressors. Finally, twin studies examining the genetic and environmental determinants of individual differences in heart rate change during the tasks revealed a substantial genetic component for these responses.

,Fostering 21St-Century Skills In Constructivist Engineering Classrooms With Digital Game-Based Learning,"Video games can be considered constructivist instructional materials because of their potential to promote student-centered opportunities in the classroom. Since the emergence of this educational trend, called digital game-based learning, several studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect that learning or recreational video games have had on learners and on their mastery of learning objectives. Many of these studies have focused on specific sets of skills that specific video games can promote. Nevertheless, there is evidence that any type of video game, regardless of its learning or recreational nature, can help students develop certain knowledge, skills, and attitudes (KSAs) that could be useful for engineering courses and projects. This evidence also suggests that digital game-based learning contributes to 21st-century skills that are necessary for competitive engineering professionals. This literature review will describe the KSAs that could be promoted in constructivist-oriented classrooms when learners engage in any type of video game. This research paper will focus on how engineering students can develop 21st-century KSAs that are implicit in each gaming opportunity, such as high-order thinking and decision-making skills, persistence, socialization, leadership skills, self-confidence, and autonomy and self-regulation. © 2013 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/RITA.2015.2452673,Scopus,Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje,"Nino M., Evans M.A.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,From Medical Information And Education Texts Into Multimedia And Telematics,"Four home electric appliances have become essential in the every day lives of most people in industrialised countries: the video tape player-recorder, the compact disk player, the fax machine and the personal computer. The fax machine, which was the only device that involved connecting with remote parties, became as common as any of the other three mentioned before, and is now essential to modern life. More recently, the Personal Computer (PC) was introduced to home environments, becoming a new common domestic appliance. Whereas in the early times the 'PC to user' symbiosis was associated with the idea of isolation and autonomy, in present times, modems, telematics and the Internet, have broken down that isolation. However, telematics are not only tools for business or serious activities: its ""domestic"" sprouting was stimulated by children and teenagers (computer game and Nintendo generations). Their interest makes their parents be more aware of the practical uses of the 'PC via modem to Net' resources,... and not only for playing games and leisure activities. The Internet enjoys absolute freedom, therefore its contents are not regulated. The content may range from very interesting and useful information (for genuine users), down to contents judged to be intended for immoral, illegal or criminal purposes (users who are foreign to the spirit of the Net). Nevertheless, I personally defend the maintenance of a climate of absolute liberty as far as the Net or telematic networks are concerned. A philosophic principle of complete free communication structures, allows the development of the human mind, eliminating frontiers and integrating mankind. Let us recall that the main paradox of ARPANET, Internet's predecessor, developed for military applications, which transcended fundamental principles of the military environment: hierarchy, rank, power or position. On the Net, users are all equal, from the most humble student with a PC to the most powerful organisation, and this is the principle we must defend. Our efforts should be oriented towards generating useful contents that are permanently updated and improved by means of user-supplier communication. In view of cultural diversity, it is also important to fill the current gaps of information supply in Spanish or other languages different from English. © 1997 The authors.",doi,10.3233/978-1-60750-880-9-345,Scopus,Studies in Health Technology and Informatics,Caston O.L.,1997,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,From Personalization To Parrhesia: A Multimodal Analysis Of Autobiographical Recalls In Barack Obama’s Political Speech,"This paper analyzes autobiographical recalls in Barack Obama’s political speech, framing them by two main theoretical perspectives rather than by the more commonly evoked theory of personalization. The first theoretical framework refers to Arendt’s concept of the self-aware pariah, as opposed to the concept of parvenu. The second theory invoked refers to the work of Michel Foucault on parrhesia, seen as a risky yet empowering communicative game. In accordance with these theoretical premises, four political speeches delivered by Barack Obama, both when he was still a “strange” incumbent and after he had become president of the USA, were selected, given the high political risks these particular speeches were addressing. Extracts sharing autobiographical memories were analyzed with both a multimodal analysis of communication and an analysis of facial expressions of emotions (facial action coding system, or FACS). Results show that these autobiographical memories conveyed parrhesiastic narratives about the social origins of Obama as a pariah. Together with these risky rhetorical moves, emotional expressions (mainly negative) were clearly evident, yet well regulated. Our concluding remarks on this first explorative analysis suggest that Obama could apply a parrhesiastic attitude to himself – making clear to all his socially disadvantaged origins – in order to persuade his audience to accept a similar parrhesiastic game for communicating about difficult aspects of the political situation of his listeners. The limitations of the study and possibilities for future developments of this line of research are discussed at the end of the chapter. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",doi,10.1007/978-3-319-14081-0_17,Scopus,Conflict and Multimodal Communication: Social Research and Machine Intelligence,"Leone G., Di Murro F., Serlupi Crescenzi L.",2015,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Frontal Midline Theta Related To Learning In A Simulated Driving Task,The occurrence of frontal midline theta activity (4-7 Hz) was studied in a simulated driving task during consecutive phases of goal-directed behaviour. Electrical activity of the forebrain (Fz) was analysed in a simulated traffic situation in which the subject had to find the correct way to drive a car through a set of roads in a computer game. The occurrence of theta activity was analysed during seven consecutive sections of the game. The results showed that the occurrence of theta activity increased during learning - successful behaviour produced more theta than unsuccessful behaviour. In some sections of the game the percentage of theta was larger than in others. It is suggested that the theta activity reflects relaxed concentration after mastering the game. © 1995.,doi,10.1016/0301-0511(95)05122-Q,Scopus,Biological Psychology,"Laukka S.J., Järvilehto T., I.

,Frontomedian Activation Depends On Both Feedback Validity And Valence: Fmri Evidence For Contextual Feedback Evaluation,"Activation within the posterior frontomedian cortex (pFMC) is suggested to be involved in decision conflict, which typically emerges whenever one does not know which action to choose in order to receive a positive outcome. Decision conflict attenuates due to learning which is often indicated by and therefore confounded with the receipt of increasingly frequent positive and decreasingly frequent negative feedback. The present functional Magnetic Resonance study aimed to disentangle the influence of the factors processing of negative feedback and contextual feedback evaluation on pFMC activation. Participants performed a forced choice paradigm in which they had to decide which one out of two competing stimuli would win in a virtual competition game. In one condition (rule learning, RL), participants were provided with valid feedback so that contextual feedback evaluation had a guiding function for action and thus enabled learning. In contrast, participants received no valid information from feedback in another condition (putative learning, PL) and hence could not learn on the basis of contextual feedback evaluation. However, a learning effect in the latter condition was simulated by gradually increasing the frequency of positive feedback and decreasing the frequency of negative feedback according to a learning model which was derived from pilot data. Importantly, participants were naive with respect to feedback manipulations. Beyond confirming pFMC activation for decision conflicts, a significant interaction between validity and valence of feedback in pFMC revealed the specific contribution of contextual feedback evaluation processes on activation of this area. Not the processing of negative feedback per se, which was found to elicit activation within anterior cingulate cortex, but the evaluation of feedback against the background of the current mental model is suggested to be reflected by pFMC activation. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

,Functional And Structural Neural Indices Of Risk Aversion In Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (Ocd),"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) patients suffer from risk aversion, which may be mediated by their exaggerated response to threat and diminished response to reward. In this study, 13 OCD patients and 13 healthy matched controls underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while playing an interactive risky choice game encompassing distinct intervals of threat and reward; as well as anatomical diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Compared to healthy controls OCD patients were reluctant to make risky choices during the game. Furthermore, they displayed higher amygdala activation to threat; lower nucleus accumbens (Nacc) activation to reward and reduced functional connectivity of the amygdala and Nacc to two frontal regions, the orbito-frontal cortex (OFC) and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), respectively. OCD patients also displayed reduced structural integrity in clusters within the uncinate and cingulum fiber tracts. Finally, these deficits in limbic-frontal connectivity pathways, both at the functional and structural level, were associated with severity of OCD symptoms, as well as with each other. Our results thus suggest that risk aversion in OCD is mediated by abnormal limbic responses to threatening and rewarding stimuli, as well as by deficient functional and structural limbic-frontal connectivity. Such deficiency characterization may aid in identifying neural predictors for treatment response and localizing individual targets for direct neural intervention treatments. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.pscychresns.2012.02.002,Scopus,Psychiatry Research - Neuroimaging,"Admon R., Bleich-Cohen M., Weizmant R., Poyurovsky M., Faragian S., Hendler T.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Game Design To Measure Reflexes And Attention Based On Biofeedback Multi-Sensor Interaction,"This paper presents a multi-sensor system for implementing biofeedback as a human-computer interaction technique in a game involving driving cars in risky situations. The sensors used are: Eye Tracker, Kinect, pulsometer, respirometer, electromiography (EMG) and galvanic skin resistance (GSR). An algorithm has been designed which gives rise to an interaction logic with the game according to the set of physiological constants obtained from the sensors. The results reflect a 72.333 response to the System Usability Scale (SUS), a significant difference of p = 0.026 in GSR values in terms of the difference between the start and end of the game, and an r = 0.659 and p = 0.008 correlation while playing with the Kinect between the breathing level and the energy and joy factor. All the sensors used had an impact on the end results, whereby none of them should be disregarded in future lines of research, even though it would be interesting to obtain separate breathing values from that of the cardio. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",doi,10.3390/s150306520,Scopus,Sensors (Switzerland),"Ortiz-Vigon Uriarte I.L., Garcia-Zapirain B., Garcia-Chimeno Y.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Games And Recovery: The Use Of Video And Computer Games To Recuperate From Stress And Strain,"The use of video and computer games for recovery purposes was investigated in an online survey of 1614 participants. The data indicate that games are systematically used after exposure to stressful situations and strain, and that recovery experience is a significant facet of the gaming experience. Using structural equation modeling, the relationships among work-related fatigue, daily hassles, social support, coping style, recovery experience, and the use of video and computer games for recovery purposes were tested. Persons who associated stronger recovery experiences with game play used video and computer games more often after stressful and exhausting situations. In addition, participants' level of work-related fatigue and exposure to daily hassles were both positively associated with the use of games for recovery. Participants with emotion-focused coping style showed a higher tendency to use games for recovery than participants with problem-focused coping style. The relationship between work-related fatigue and game use for recovery purposes was moderated by social support. The stress buffering function of video and computer games was more important for participants receiving less social support. These participants showed a stronger relationship between work-related fatigue and the use of games for recovery than participants receiving more social support. © 2009 Hogrefe Publishing.",doi,10.1027/1864-1105.21.3.126,Scopus,Journal of Media Psychology,Reinecke L.,2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Gender Differences In Cardiovascular Reactivity,"Pronounced cardiovascular reactivity to stress is a behavioral mechanism that may underlie the pathophysiology of coronary heart disease (CHD). Based on the greater incidence of CHD among males than among females, the purpose of the current investigation was to test the hypothesis that in young adults (ages 17-29), males (n=47) show more cardiovascular reactivity than females (n=61) to two stressors, a video game and cigarette smoking. Five of the six comparisons did not support the hypothesis: females were higher on heart rate and diastolic blood pressure reactivity to both Stressors; males were higher on systolic blood pressure reactivity to the video game only. The results suggest that females may be particularly physiologically reactive to cigarette smoking. © 1990 Plenum Publishing Corporation.",doi,10.1007/BF00844995,Scopus,Journal of Behavioral Medicine,"Stone S.V., Dembroski T.M., Costa Jr. P.T., MacDougall J.M.",1990,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Geogame Analytics – A Cyber-Enabled Petri Dish For Geographic Modeling And Simulation,"As researchers start to conceptualize human-environmental interactions through coupled human and natural systems research, the non-linear, dynamic, heterogeneous, feedback loops that are characteristic of those systems challenges a long-standing Newtonian paradigm of systems reducible to component parts, deterministic behavior, and the existence of equilibrium. As an alternative, complex systems researchers often use agent-based models (ABM) or multi-agent systems (MAS) to model and simulate complexity in human-environmental interactions. This paper briefly reports on the development of a novel cyberinfrastructure portal solution called GeoGames. This computing environment integrates and leverages web-GIS and multiplayer online game technology to enable simulations of real-world scenarios of coupled human and natural systems applicable to anything from cities, urban regions to other human settlements. While there are some similarities between GeoGames and games like SimCity, and Civilization, a fundamental idea underlying the GeoGames approach is the focus on creating an on-line world that mirrors (c.f. Gelernter, 1991) authentic real-world geography, realized by a full range of GIS supported mapping and processing services (Ahlqvist, Loffing, Ramanathan, & Kocher, P). In the context of our prototype platform we present the emerging area of Spatial Game Analytics (Drachen & Schubert, 2013) that provides an uncharted area for data-intensive geospatial scenario analysis. Our example scenario is a game that models the relationships of land management on hydrology and water quality. Our presentation is illustrated with examples from our own prototype platform that has generated a significant amount of user data on game play decisions and behavior. Exploratory GeoGame analytics are used to mine the spatial behavior of hundreds of players in order to identify how variations in the rules (land use policies) and varying locations (spatial configurations) affect the simulation outcomes. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",doi,10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2017.08.013,Scopus,"Computers, Environment and Urban Systems","Ahlqvist O., Khodke N., Ramnath R.",2018,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Going Further In Affective Computing: How Emotion Recognition Can Improve Adaptive User Interaction,"This article joins the fields of emotion recognition and human computer interaction. While muchwork has been done on recognizing emotions, they are hardly used to improve a user’s interaction with a system. Although the fields of affective computing and especially serious games already make use of detected emotions, they tend to provide application and user specific adaptions only on the task level. We present an approach of utilizing recognized emotions to improve the interaction itself, independent of the underlying application at hand. Examining the state of the art in emotion recognition research and based on the architecture of Companion-System, a generic approach for determining the main cause of an emotion within the history of interactions is presented, allowing a specific reaction and adaption. Using such an approach could lead to systems that use emotions to improve not only the outcome of a task but the interaction itself in order to be truly individual and empathic. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",doi,10.1007/978-3-319-31056-5_6,Scopus,Intelligent Systems Reference Library,"Meudt S., Schmidt-Wack M., Honold F., Schüssel F., Weber M., Schwenker F., Palm G.",2016,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Habituation And Dishabituation Of Human Salivary Response,"Habituation may be relevant for understanding how sensory stimuli influence factors related to ingestive behavior. In the first of three experiments in humans we showed that salivation and hedonic ratings to lemon or lime juice habituated within 10 presentations, and dishabituation of the salivation and hedonic ratings to the original juice were observed after a new juice was presented. Experiment 2 replicated the habituation and decrease in hedonics to lemon juice, and showed both dishabituation and a relative increase in hedonics when chocolate taste, rather than another juice, served as the dishabituating stimulus. In a third experiment we showed a video game, a nontaste stimulus, could serve as a distractor to prevent the development of habituation, as well as a dishabituator after habituation had occurred. © 1992.",doi,10.1016/0031-9384(92)90075-D,Scopus,Physiology and Behavior,"Epstein L.H., Rodefer J.S., Wisniewski L., Caggiula A.R.",1992,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Head Movement And Facial Expressions As Game Input,"This study aimed to develop and test a hands-free video game that utilizes information on the player's real-time face position and facial expressions as intrinsic elements of a gameplay. Special focus was given to investigating the user's subjective experiences in utilizing computer vision input in the game interaction. The player's goal was to steer a drunken character home as quickly as possible by moving their head. Additionally, the player could influence the behavior of game characters by using the facial expressions of frowning and smiling. The participants played the game with computer vision and a conventional joystick and rated the functionality of the control methods and their emotional and game experiences. The results showed that although the functionality of the joystick steering was rated higher than that of the computer vision method, the use of head movements and facial expressions enhanced the experiences of game playing in many ways. The participants rated playing with the computer vision technique as more entertaining, interesting, challenging, immersive, and arousing than doing so with a joystick. The results suggested that a high level of experienced arousal in the case of computer vision-based interaction may be a key factor for better experiences of game playing. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",doi,10.1016/j.entcom.2014.04.005,Scopus,Entertainment Computing,"Ilves M., Gizatdinova Y., Surakka V., Vankka E.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,"Heritability Of Daytime Cortisol Levels And Cortisol Reactivity In Children. Psychoneuroendocrinology, 34(2), 273–280.","Individuals differ widely in cortisol output over the day and cortisol reactivity to challenge, both of which are relevant to disease risk. There is limited evidence concerning the heritability of these differences, so we evaluated the heritability of cortisol levels in the afternoon and cortisol reactivity using a twin design. The study involved 80 monozygotic (MZ) and 70 dizygotic (DZ) same-sex twin pairs aged 11.2 years on average. Salivary cortisol was measured in the afternoon at home before and after playing a computer game. Ratings of excitement and upset were also obtained, and objective task performance was assessed. Salivary cortisol levels averaged 4.08 (S.D. 2.3) nmol/l at pretask baseline, and declined on average over the session to 3.45 (1.9) nmol/l immediately after the tasks and 2.87 (1.6) nmol/l 10min later. There were, however, marked individual differences, with cortisol reactivity (difference between pretask baseline and post-task 1) ranging from +4.53 to -6.23nmol/l. Intra-class correlations for all the cortisol parameters were substantially greater for MZ (range 0.41-0.57) than for DZ (0.11-0.29) twin pairs. Quantitative genetic modelling confirmed significant heritability for pretask baseline cortisol (58%), the two post-task values (60 and 56%), and cortisol reactivity (44%). The study lacked power for assessing sex differences. Subjective reports of excitement were also somewhat heritable, but there was little covariation of cortisol and subjective responses, so genetic influences on covariation could not be tested. These findings indicate that individual differences in children's cortisol levels recorded before tasks and cortisol reactivity to behavioural challenges are influenced by genetic factors.",doi,10.1016/j.psyneuen.2008.09.006,nagy2015,Psychoneuroendocrinology,"Steptoe, A., van Jaarsveld, C.

,Hip Hop Dance Experience Linked To Sociocognitive Ability,"Expertise within gaming (e.g., chess, video games) and kinesthetic (e.g., sports, classical dance) activities has been found to be linked with specific cognitive skills. Some of these skills, working memory, mental rotation, problem solving, are linked to higher performance in science, technology, math, and engineering (STEM) disciplines. In the present study, we examined whether experience in a different activity, hip hop dance, is also linked to cognitive abilities connected with STEM skills as well as social cognition ability. Dancers who varied in hip hop and other dance style experience were presented with a set of computerized tasks that assessed working memory capacity, mental rotation speed, problem solving efficiency, and theory of mind. We found that, when controlling for demographic factors and other dance style experience, those with greater hip hop dance experience were faster at mentally rotating images of hands at greater angle disparities and there was a trend for greater accuracy at identifying positive emotions displayed by cropped images of human faces. We suggest that hip hop dance, similar to other more technical activities such as video gameplay, tap some specific cognitive abilities that underlie STEM skills. Furthermore, we suggest that hip hop dance experience can be used to reach populations who may not otherwise be interested in other kinesthetic or gaming activities and potentially enhance select sociocognitive skills. © 2017 Bonny et al.

,How Much Control Is Enough? Influence Of Unreliable Input On User Experience,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) provide a valuable new input modality within human-computer interaction systems. However, like other body-based inputs such as gesture or gaze based systems, the system recognition of input commands is still far from perfect. This raises important questions, such as what level of control should such an interface be able to provide. What is the relationship between actual and perceived control? And in the case of applications for entertainment in which fun is an important part of user experience, should we even aim for the highest level of control, or is the optimum elsewhere? In this paper, we evaluate whether we can modulate the amount of control and if a game can be fun with less than perfect control. In the experiment users (n=158) played a simple game in which a hamster has to be guided to the exit of a maze. The amount of control the user has over the hamster is varied. The variation of control through confusion matrices makes it possible to simulate the experience of using a BCI, while using the traditional keyboard for input. After each session the user completed a short questionnaire on user experience and perceived control. Analysis of the data showed that the perceived control of the user could largely be explained by the amount of control in the respective session. As expected, user frustration decreases with increasing control. Moreover, the results indicate that the relation between fun and control is not linear. Although at lower levels of control fun does increase with improved control, the level of fun drops just before perfect control is reached (with an optimum around 96%). This poses new insights for developers of games who want to incorporate some form of BCI or other modality with unreliable input in their game: for creating a fun game, unreliable input can be used to create a challenge for the user. © 2013 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TCYB.2013.2282279,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,"Van De Laar B., Bos D.P.-O., Reuderink B., Poel M., Nijholt A.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Hpasubc: A Suite Of Tools For User Subclassification Of Human Protein Atlas Tissue Images.,"The human protein atlas (HPA) is a powerful proteomic tool for visualizing the distribution of protein expression across most human tissues and many common malignancies. The HPA includes immunohistochemically-stained images from tissue microarrays (TMAs) that cover 48 tissue types and 20 common malignancies. The TMA data are used to provide expression information at the tissue, cellular, and occasionally, subcellular level. The HPA also provides subcellular data from confocal immunofluorescence data on three cell lines. Despite the availability of localization data, many unique patterns of cellular and subcellular expression are not documented. To get at this more granular data, we have developed a suite of Python scripts, HPASubC, to aid in subcellular, and cell-type specific classification of HPA images. This method allows the user to download and optimize specific HPA TMA images for review. Then, using a playstation-style video game controller, a trained observer can rapidly step through 10's of 1000's of images to identify patterns of interest. We have successfully used this method to identify 703 endothelial cell (EC) and/or smooth muscle cell (SMCs) specific proteins discovered within 49,200 heart TMA images. This list will assist us in subdividing cardiac gene or protein array data into expression by one of the predominant cell types of the myocardium: Myocytes, SMCs or ECs. The opportunity to further characterize unique staining patterns across a range of human tissues and malignancies will accelerate our understanding of disease processes and point to novel markers for tissue evaluation in surgical pathology.",doi,10.4103/2153-3539.159213,pubmed,Journal of pathology informatics,"Cornish, Toby C; Chakravarti, Aravinda; Kapoor, Ashish; Halushka, Marc K",2015,NA,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Human Behavior Analysis For Highlight Ranking In Broadcast Racket Sports Video,"The majority of existing work on sports video analysis concentrates on highlight extraction. Little work focuses on the important issue as how the extracted highlights should be organized. In this paper, we present a multimodal approach to organize the highlights extracted from racket sports video grounded on human behavior analysis using a nonlinear affective ranking model. Two research challenges of highlight ranking are addressed, namely affective feature extraction and ranking model construction. The basic principle of affective feature extraction in our work is to extract sensitive features which can stimulate user's emotion. Since the users pay most attention to player behavior and audience response in racket sport highlights, we extract affective features from player behavior including action and trajectory, and game-specific audio keywords. We propose a novel motion analysis method to recognize the player actions. We employ support vector regression to construct the nonlinear highlight ranking model from affective features. A new subjective evaluation criterion is proposed to guide the model construction. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approaches, we have tested them on more than ten-hour broadcast tennis and badminton videos. The experimental results demonstrate that our action recognition approach significantly outperforms the existing appearance-based method. Moreover, our user study shows that the affective highlight ranking approach is effective. © 2007 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TMM.2007.902847,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Multimedia,"Zhu G., Huang Q., Xu C., Xing L., Gao W., Yao H.",2007,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,I Wish I Were A Warrior: The Role Of Wishful Identification In The Effects Of Violent Video Games On Aggression In Adolescent Boys.,"This study tested the hypothesis that violent video games are especially likely to increase aggression when players identify with violent game characters. Dutch adolescent boys with low education ability (N=112) were randomly assigned to play a realistic or fantasy violent or nonviolent video game. Next, they competed with an ostensible partner on a reaction time task in which the winner could blast the loser with loud noise through headphones (the aggression measure). Participants were told that high noise levels could cause permanent hearing damage. Habitual video game exposure, trait aggressiveness, and sensation seeking were controlled for. As expected, the most aggressive participants were those who played a violent game and wished they were like a violent character in the game. These participants used noise levels loud enough to cause permanent hearing damage to their partners, even though their partners had not provoked them. These results show that identifying with violent video game characters makes players more aggressive. Players were especially likely to identify with violent characters in realistic games and with games they felt immersed in.

Relative FDG metabolic rate was obtained from regions of interest in the prefrontal cortex, cingulate, striatum and visual cortex. Monetary reward blackjack was associated with significantly higher relative metabolic rate in the primary visual cortex (Brodmann area 17), the cingulate gryus (Brodmann area 24), the putamen and prefrontal areas 47 and 10, compared to blackjack playing for points only. No area tested showed a significant decrease. This pattern suggests heightened limbic and sensory activation in the gambling for money condition with increased emotional valence and greater risk and reward, and confirms the salience of monetary reward in the development of pathological gambling. © 2005 Taylor &amp; Francis.",doi,10.1080/15622970510029768,Scopus,World Journal of Biological Psychiatry,"Hollander E., Pallanti S., Baldini Rossi N., Sood E., Baker B.R., Buchsbaum M.S.",2005,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,In-Class Active Video Game Supplementation And Adherence To Cardiac Rehabilitation,"Purpose: The application of active video games (AVGs) during cardiac rehabilitation (CR) sessions could potentially facilitate patient adherence. The feasibility, safety, and efficacy of in-class AVG supplementation as an alternative to conventional phase 2 programs were investigated. Methods: A pilot, evaluator-blinded, intention-to-treat, randomized controlled trial recruited 32 low-moderate risk CR participants and allocated them to conventional or AVG-supplemented exercise. Both groups experienced equal exercise loads for 6 weeks. Patients were assessed at baseline, end of the program, and after an 8-week followup. Adherence and safety-related outcomes were the primary endpoints. Secondary outcomes included change in exercise capacity, daily physical activity (PA), energy expenditure (EE), and psychometric profiling. Results: Patients (males 81%; 60 ± 10 years) presented with typical cardiovascular risk factors and similar baseline characteristics. Participants did not perceive an increased risk of injury and were more interactive. At the end of the program, there was a lower tendency for dropping out (6% vs 19%, P >.05), a significant improvement in PA (322 vs 247 arbitrary acceleration units/min, P =.047) and related EE per body weight (13 vs 11 kcal/kg/d, P =.04) among AVG participants compared with controls. No significant differences between groups for adverse medical events, exercise capacity, affect toward exercise, anxiety, depression, or quality-of-life changes were reported. Conclusions: The additional use of AVGs during CR sessions is feasible, safe, and significantly improved daily PA and EE. A dropout reduction trend among its users, which needs to be confirmed in a larger trial, raises awareness to AVG supplementation as a promising strategy to increase CR adherence.

,Increased Neural Reactivity To Socio-Emotional Stimuli Links Social Exclusion And Aggression,"We investigated changes in the neural processing of social information as possible link between social exclusion and aggression. Participants played a virtual ball game with two putative game partners, during which half of the 34 participants were excluded. Then, participants played the Taylor Aggression Paradigm (TAP) against the same partners. An empathy paradigm followed, in which participants watched pictures of neutral and emotional social scenes, while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Excluded participants showed stronger neural reactivity to emotional compared to neutral pictures than included participants in regions associated with cognitive mentalizing and the mirror neuron system (bilateral superior, middle and inferior temporal gyrus, bilateral precuneus, right precentral gyrus). Reactivity of left inferior temporal gyrus and right precentral gyrus was positively correlated with aggressive behavior in the TAP. Our results support previous behavioral findings which suggest changes in social information processing as mediator between exclusion and aggression. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",doi,10.1016/j.biopsycho.2013.12.008,Scopus,Biological Psychology,"Beyer F., Münte T.F., Krämer U.M.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,"Individual Differences In Motives, Preferences, And Pathology In Video Games: The Gaming Attitudes, Motives, And Experiences Scales (Games)","A new measure of individual habits and preferences in video game use is developed in order to better study the risk factors of pathological game use (i.e., excessively frequent or prolonged use, sometimes called ""game addiction""). This measure was distributed to internet message boards for game enthusiasts and to college undergraduates. An exploratory factor analysis identified 9 factors: Story, Violent Catharsis, Violent Reward, Social Interaction, Escapism, Loss-Sensitivity, Customization, Grinding, and Autonomy. These factors demonstrated excellent fit in a subsequent confirmatory factor analysis, and, importantly, were found to reliably discriminate between inter-individual game preferences (e.g., Super Mario Brothers as compared to Call of Duty). Moreover, three factors were significantly related to pathological game use: the use of games to escape daily life, the use of games as a social outlet, and positive attitudes toward the steady accumulation of in-game rewards. The current research identifies individual preferences and motives relevant to understanding video game players' evaluations of different games and risk factors for pathological video game use. © 2013 Hilgard, Engelhardt and Bartholow.",doi,10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00608,Scopus,Frontiers in Psychology,"Hilgard J., Engelhardt C.R., Bartholow B.D.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Influence Of Control And Physical Effort On Cardiovascular Reactivity To A Video Game Task,"This study investigated the influences of both perceived control and physical effort on cardiovascular reactivity. Undergraduates (N = 32) played a video game task interrupted by aversive noise. Perceived control of the noise was manipulated by instructions indicating the presence or absence of a contingency between performance and noise presentations. Physical effort was manipulated by controlling the physical force required to perform the task. There was a significant main effect of control on systolic blood pressure (SBP) and total peripheral resistance (TPR), with both increasing more during low than high control conditions, The results suggest that high perceived control over aversive noise in an effortful task reduces SBP and TPR reactivity relative to low perceived control. The results are consistent with the idea that control buffers the reactivity associated with task performance under aversive conditions.",doi,10.1017/S0048577202394083,Scopus,Psychophysiology,"Weinstein S.E., Quigley K.S., Mordkoff J.T.",2002,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas

,Integrating Health Behavior Theory And Design Elements In Serious Games.,"Internet interventions for improving health and well-being have the potential to reach many people and fill gaps in service provision. Serious gaming interfaces provide opportunities to optimize user adherence and impact. Health interventions based in theory and evidence and tailored to psychological constructs have been found to be more effective to promote behavior change. Defining the design elements which engage users and help them to meet their goals can contribute to better informed serious games. To elucidate design elements important in SPARX, a serious game for adolescents with depression, from a user-centered perspective. We proposed a model based on an established theory of health behavior change and practical features of serious game design to organize ideas and rationale. We analyzed data from 5 studies comprising a total of 22 focus groups and 66 semistructured interviews conducted with youth and families in New Zealand and Australia who had viewed or used SPARX. User perceptions of the game were applied to this framework. A coherent framework was established using the three constructs of self-determination theory (SDT), autonomy, competence, and relatedness, to organize user perceptions and design elements within four areas important in design: computer game, accessibility, working alliance, and learning in immersion. User perceptions mapped well to the framework, which may assist developers in understanding the context of user needs. By mapping these elements against the constructs of SDT, we were able to propose a sound theoretical base for the model. This study's method allowed for the articulation of design elements in a serious game from a user-centered perspective within a coherent overarching framework. The framework can be used to deliberately incorporate serious game design elements that support a user's sense of autonomy, competence, and relatedness, key constructs which have been found to mediate motivation at all stages of the change process. The resulting model introduces promising avenues for future exploration. Involving users in program design remains an imperative if serious games are to be fit for purpose.",doi,10.2196/mental.4133,pubmed,JMIR mental health,"Cheek, Colleen; Fleming, Theresa; Lucassen, Mathijs Fg; Bridgman, Heather; Stasiak, Karolina; Shepherd, Matthew; Orpin, Peter",2015,NA,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Interactive Graphics For Expressing Health Risks: Development And Qualitative Evaluation,"Recent findings suggest that interactive game-like graphics might be useful in communicating probabilities. We developed a prototype for a risk communication module, focusing on eliciting users' preferences for different interactive graphics and assessing usability and user interpretations. Feedback from five focus groups was used to design the graphics. The final version displayed a matrix of square buttons; clicking on any button allowed the user to see whether the stick figure underneath was affected by the health outcome. When participants used this interaction to learn about a risk, they expressed more emotional responses, both positive and negative, than when viewing any static graphic or numerical description of a risk. Their responses included relief about small risks and concern about large risks. The groups also commented on static graphics: arranging the figures affected by disease randomly throughout a group of figures made it more difficult to judge the proportion affected but often was described as more realistic. Interactive graphics appear to have potential for expressing risk magnitude as well as the feeling of risk. This affective impact could be useful in increasing perceived threat of high risks, calming fears about low risks, or comparing risks. Quantitative studies are planned to assess the effect on perceived risks and estimated risk magnitudes.

,Introduction: Self-Action Models,"This chapter defines a general framework of self-action models, in which the self-repair network is considered. Motivations for the self-action models will be discussed by correspondence between information-intensive artificial systems (information systems involving connected computers) and biological systems. With increasing similarity between these two systems, emphasis is placed on a game theoretic approach for selfish agents and evolutionary mechanism for the autonomy and maintenance of information-intensive artificial systems. The background is also explained, introducing related paradigms of autonomic computing, recovery oriented computing and grid computing. Other related fields such as game theory (with evolutionary and spatial game theory), network sciences (with the graph theory and statistics), interacting particle systems (based on probabilistic process theory) and reliability theory are also briefly explained. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",doi,10.1007/978-3-319-26447-9_1,Scopus,Intelligent Systems Reference Library,[No author name available],2015,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Investment And Repayment In A Trust Game After Ventromedial Prefrontal Damage,"Although trust and reciprocity are ubiquitous in social exchange, their neurobiological substrate remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated the effect of damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC)-a brain region critical for valuing social information-on individuals' decisions in a trust game and in a risk game. In the trust game, one player, the investor, is endowed with a sum of money, which she can keep or invest. The amount she decides to invest is tripled and sent to the other player, the trustee, who then decides what fraction to return to the investor. In separate runs, ten patients with focal bilateral damage to the vmPFC and control participants made decision while playing in the role of either investor or trustee with different anonymous counterparts in each run. A risk game was also included in which the investor faced exactly the same decisions as in the trust game, but a random device (i.e., a computer), not another player, determined the final payoffs. Results showed that vmPFC patients' investments were not modulated by the type of opponent player (e.g., human vs. computer) present in the environment. Thus, vmPFC patients showed comparable risk-taking preferences both in social (trust game) and nonsocial (risk game) contexts. In stark contrast, control participants were less willing to take risk and invest when they believed that they were interacting with people than a computer. Furthermore, when acted as trustee, vmPFC patients made lower back transfers toward investors, thereby showing less reciprocity behavior. Taken together, these results indicate that social valuation and emotion subserved by vmPFC have a critical role in trusting and reciprocity decisions. The present findings support the hypothesis that vmPFC damage may impair affective systems specifically designed for mediating social transaction with other individuals. © 2013 Moretto, Sellitto and Di Pellegrino.",doi,10.3389/fnhum.2013.00593,Scopus,Frontiers in Human Neuroscience,"Moretto G., Sellitt M., di Pellegrino G.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Keeping Score In The Ip Game,"The US patent system will soon face a legislative reform as many have suggested that the current patent system itself has given too much power to those laying claim to intellectual property and allowing too much leeway to patents of dubious quality or worth. In one case, Microsoft Corporation is facing charges of implementing the music format mp3 on it's media player while Alcatel-Lucent claims that Microsoft has infringed on its intellectual property rights. The new proposal is about creating a procedure for challenging patents after they are issued, bolstering the traditional standard that patents should be confined to non obvious ideas and strengthening the overwhelmed US Patent and Trademark Office. The Patent Reform Act of 2007 would establish a procedure for challenging patents after their issuance, limit the ability of litigants to gain support from sympathetic courts and redefine what constitutes willful infringement. In addition, it will set damages based on the patent's contribution to a product's value rather than the total value of the product.",doi,10.1109/MSPEC.2007.4378457,Scopus,IEEE Spectrum,Sweet W.,2007,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Killing Is Positive! Intra-Game Responses Meet The Necessary (But Not Sufficient) Theoretical Conditions For Influencing Aggressive Behavior,"This paper reports a study designed to investigate whether playing violent video games elicits the psychological conditions theoretically required for media use to cause aggressive behavior. Specifically, the study was designed to examine whether these games elicit desensitization, facilitation, and disinhibition. Thus, does physiological arousal in response to violent activity decrease over time during game play, and is there a difference between novice and experienced game players (as would be expected if desensitization had occurred)? Do players experience positive emotional states when actively engaged in virtual violent behavior (fighting and killing opponents) - a necessary condition for disinhibition? Do game players frame their motivations in terms of self-defense and game success, as would be necessary for facilitation to occur? The results showed that playing first-person shooters did elicit these requisite patterns of cognitive, physiological, and emotional states. Violent game play is a positive, arousing, present, dominant experience, as required for disinhibition and facilitation. Experienced game players are less aroused than less experienced game players (as required for desensitization). Further, during a game-playing session, exploring and searching for enemies become less arousing, while fighting and killing become more arousing over time (as required by desensitization and facilitation). © 2012 Hogrefe Publishing.",doi,10.1027/1864-1105/a000075,Scopus,Journal of Media Psychology,"Lang A., Bradley S.D., Schneider E.F., Kim S.C., Mayell S.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas

,Learning Basic Surgical Skills Through Simulator Training,"Computer-based surgical training simulators are instrumental in skill-based training and performance measurement. However, to date, the educational employment of these tools lacks empirically founded insights and effective practical guidelines. This study examined surgical residents during computer-based simulator training of basic laparoscopic surgical skills. The quantitative analysis of residents' performance averages from training onset to completion produced mixed results, revealing skill improvements as well as decreases, depending on the parameter. The results obtained from the simulator parameters and questionnaires showed that residents with either prior laparoscopic experience or gaming experience significantly outperformed their colleagues. Based on feedback and video-recorded performance analysis, the study concluded that autonomous training with the simulator is not sufficient for developing a minimum standard of performance. Residents need an adequate level of content-based feedback and supervisor support during training. We advise a more detailed and pedagogically informative measurement and feedback system, including specialist-instructor guidance, be developed. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",doi,10.1007/s11251-012-9217-6,Scopus,Instructional Science,"Silvennoinen M., Helfenstein S., Ruoranen M., Saariluoma P.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Learning Disabilities And Visual-Motor Skills; Comparing Assessment From A Hapto-Virtual Reality Tool And Bender-Gestalt Test,"Previous investigations conducted on post-secondary adult students with learning disabilities (LD) suggest that deficits in visual-motor skills contribute to difficulties in written expression which impact academic achievement. Intervention strategies for individuals with LD include assistive computer-based technologies (ATs) to compensate for or maximize performance. However, research fails to assess the impact of ATs on performance, learning, and motivation of students with LD. Also, one of the limitations of ATs is that they cannot be used for assessment and training and there are very few methods to assess or train visual-motor skills in this population. The present study explores the usefulness of a hapto-visual virtual reality motor skills assessment (MSA) device for visual-motor functioning in adults with and without LD. This is a preliminary step of developing an intervention to improve impaired visual-motor skills in adults with LD. A sample of 22 male and female university students with and without LD had their visual-motor skills pretested using a standard paper-and-pencil Bender-Gestalt (BG) test and were compared according to their performance on the MSA tool. We hypothesized that our LD participants' performance would be significantly lower than our control participants on the VR task in terms of number of errors and speed. Results showed that participants without LD performed better and more rapidly on the VR task than participants with LD. There were no correlations between the BG and MSA performance. We did not find significant differences between the groups on the Bender-Gestalt scores, previous experience with video game, arousal, and mood. Our results suggest that a novel 3D virtual reality tool such as the MSA can potentially discriminate motor function of people with and without LD; however, the difference between both may also be due to a lack of problem-solving ability in LD. © 2014 Springer-Verlag London.",doi,10.1007/s10055-014-0242-4,Scopus,Virtual Reality,"Tremblay L., Chebbi B., Bouchard S., Cimon-Lambert K., Carmichael J.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Lessons Learned About The Development Of Digital Entertainment Tools For Experiments On Resources Distribution,"Resource Distribution is a topic from the field of distributive judgement, generally studied by cognitive psychology researchers, which make use of economic experiments to investigate aspects of the evolution of cooperation, altruism and selfishness in humanity. Researchers commonly set experiments to observe human behavior, seeking to increase the degree of engagement of the participants, in order to improve the quality and the amount of results. Digital entertainment artifacts, such as video games, are then used as a viable way of bringing such a high level of engagement. However, psychology researchers usually do not have the knowledge needed to develop digital applications. In addition, as far as we know, no scientific work have tried to describe the impact of using digital entertainment tools in experiments on decision making for resource division. This work aims to report a compilation of discoveries and knowledge learned when designing digital entertainment tools, tailored for scientific experiments on Resources Distribution. The task included interviews with specialists, a questionnaire sent to researchers, the conduction of ideation techniques to generate new concepts and, finally, a set of tools were prototyped and a subset was ultimately developed. Results were collected and six main lessons we learned are reported. We hope these lessons learned to be helpful to guide others researchers to conceive and develop their own digital entertainment tools for scientific experimentation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",doi,10.1016/j.chb.2017.01.023,Scopus,Computers in Human Behavior,"Martins S.L., Cabral G.R.E., Junior L.D.S.M., Martins E.H.C.F., Cabral G.R.E.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Locus Of Control Predicts Appraisals And Cardiovascular Reactivity To A Novel Active Coping Task,"These two studies investigated the influence of dispositional locus of control (LOC) on subjective and physiological responses to a novel laboratory stressor task. Across two studies, 64 healthy undergraduate students, ages 18-22, completed Levenson's (LOC) scales for internal, powerful others, and chance prior to performing a video-game task. Participants rated pretask and posttask stressfulness and coping ability (i.e., measures of primary and secondary appraisal). Cardiovascular measures (heart period, HP; preejection period, PEP; respiratory sinus arrhythmia, RSA; cardiac output, CO; systolic blood pressure, SBP; diastolic blood pressure, DBP & total peripheral resistance, TPR) were recorded during 4-minute baseline and 4-minute stressor task periods. The internal LOC factor predicted pretask reports of coping ability as well as posttask reports of stressfulness. In contrast, the powerful-others LOC factor predicted cardiac changes (HP, PEP, and RSA) during the task but not cardiac output or any other vascular change measure. These results underscore the importance of using the three subscales of the Levenson LOC to assess relationships between dispositional LOC and the response to stressors because self-reported appraisals of a task are predicted by a different component of dispositional LOC than are task-related cardiovascular functions. © 2006, Blackwell Publishing, Inc.",doi,10.1111/j.1467-6494.2006.00396.x,Scopus,Journal of Personality,"Weinstein S.E., Quigley K.S.",2006,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Long Alternating Codes 1. Search By Playing Dominoes,"A new extremely effective method of finding strong alternating codes for incoherent scatter radars has been invented. The power of this method is described by the fact that the longest code known at the moment contains 4,194,304 bits, whereas the older methods could find codes only up to the length of 32 bits. This result means that strong alternating codes are now available for all needs of any present or future incoherent scatter hardware which one can imagine. The search method can be explained in two ways. The first one is an astonishing game of dominoes, which is not useful in the practical search but allows the search method to be easily visualized. The second presentation is a mathematical description of the method in a form suitable for computer search. The method is explained in a series of two papers. In this first paper the presentation of alternating codes in terms of Walsh indices is reviewed and the game of dominoes is described.

,Major Depressive Disorder Is Characterized By Greater Reward Network Activation To Monetary Than Pleasant Image Rewards,"Anhedonia, the loss of interest or pleasure in normally rewarding activities, is a hallmark feature of unipolar Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). A growing body of literature has identified frontostriatal dysfunction during reward anticipation and outcomes in MDD. However, no study to date has directly compared responses to different types of rewards such as pleasant images and monetary rewards in MDD. To investigate the neural responses to monetary and pleasant image rewards in MDD, a modified Monetary Incentive Delay task was used during functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess neural responses during anticipation and receipt of monetary and pleasant image rewards. Participants included nine adults with MDD and 13 affectively healthy controls. The MDD group showed lower activation than controls when anticipating monetary rewards in right orbitofrontal cortex and subcallosal cortex, and when anticipating pleasant image rewards in paracingulate and supplementary motor cortex. The MDD group had relatively greater activation in right putamen when anticipating monetary versus pleasant image rewards, relative to the control group. Results suggest reduced reward network activation in MDD when anticipating rewards, as well as relatively greater hypoactivation to pleasant image than monetary rewards. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.pscychresns.2011.06.012,Scopus,Psychiatry Research - Neuroimaging,"Smoski M.J., Rittenberg A., Dichter G.S.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Making Work Fun: Investigating Antecedents Of Perceived Enjoyment In Human Computation Games For Information Sharing,"The advent of online games, crowdsourcing, and user-generated content has led to the emergence of a new paradigm called the Human Computation Games (HCGs) which utilize games as a motivator to encourage users' participation in human computation. HCGs are different from games for pure entertainment which emphasize play and fun, rather than output generation. Therefore, research has yet to fully explore the factors underlying players' perception of HCG enjoyment. In this paper, we study the influence of motivational needs satisfaction and perceived output quality on perceived HCG enjoyment using a survey (N = 205) of a location-based information sharing HCG called SPLASH, developed as part of our research. According to the results, perceived needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness influence perceived enjoyment of HCGs, suggesting that HCGs that fulfill these three needs are more likely to be enjoyable, thereby encouraging players to make useful computations. The results also show that participants who perceive higher levels output relevancy report a greater level of enjoyment, indicating that HCGs that assist players in generating relevant outputs are more likely to be perceived as enjoyable. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

,"Media Use, Face-To-Face Communication, Media Multitasking, And Social Well-Being Among 8- To 12-Year-Old Girls","An online survey of 3,461 North American girls ages 8-12 conducted in the summer of 2010 through Discovery Girls magazine examined the relationships between social well-being and young girls' media use-including video, video games, music listening, reading/homework, e-mailing/posting on social media sites, texting/instant messaging, and talking on phones/video chatting-and face-to-face communication. This study introduced both a more granular measure of media multitasking and a new comparative measure of media use versus time spent in face-to-face communication. Regression analyses indicated that negative social well-being was positively associated with levels of uses of media that are centrally about interpersonal interaction (e.g., phone, online communication) as well as uses of media that are not (e.g., video, music, and reading). Video use was particularly strongly associated with negative social well-being indicators. Media multitasking was also associated with negative social indicators. Conversely, face-to-face communication was strongly associated with positive social well-being. Cell phone ownership and having a television or computer in one's room had little direct association with children's socioemotional well-being. We hypothesize possible causes for these relationships, call for research designs to address causality, and outline possible implications of such findings for the social well-being of younger adolescents. © 2012 American Psychological Association.",doi,10.1037/a0027030,Scopus,Developmental Psychology,"Pea R., Nass C., Meheula L., Rance M., Kumar A., Bamford H., Nass M., Simha A., Stillerman B., Yang S., Zhou M.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Media Violence And Social Neuroscience: New Questions And New Opportunities,"Decades of research have demonstrated that exposure to violence on television can cause increases in aggression. The recent emergence of violent video games has raised new questions regarding the effects of violent media. The General Aggression Model (GAM) predicts that exposure to violent media increases aggressive behavior through one of three primary pathways (arousal, cognitions, and affect). Past psychophysiological research has supported GAM but has been limited to examining arousal-related variables. Recent advances in social neuroscience have opened the door to investigations of exposure to violent media on cognitive and affective components and their neurocognitive underpinnings. Neuroscience tools have the potential to provide answers to the new questions posed by recent advances in media technology. © Copyright © 2007 Association for Psychological Science.",doi,10.1111/j.1467-8721.2007.00499.x,Scopus,Current Directions in Psychological Science,"Carnagey N.L., Anderson C.A., Bartholow B.D.",2007,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Media Violence Exposure In Aggressive And Control Adolescents: Differences In Self- And Parent-Reported Exposure To Violence On Television And In Video Games.,"The purpose of present study was to investigate differences in media violence exposure between groups of adolescents with and without Disruptive Behavior Disorders with Aggressive Features, using a case-controlled design and multimethod assessment. Samples of 27 adolescents aged 13-17 with Disruptive Behavior Disorder with Aggressive Features and 27 age-gender-IQ matched controls completed a semistructured interview about exposure to violence on television and video games; parents completed a corresponding questionnaire measure. Moderate intercorrelations were found between most self- and parent-report television and video game violence exposure measures. Compared to control adolescents, adolescents with Disruptive Behavior Disorder with Aggressive Features had higher aggregate media violence exposure, higher exposure to video game violence, and higher parent-reported exposure to television violence. Results show that adolescents and parents agree about the adolescent's level of media violence exposure, that exposure to violence on television tends to be accompanied by exposure to violence in video games, and that the association between media violence exposure and Disruptive Behavior Disorder with Aggressive Features is not due to a spurious effect of gender or IQ.

,"Mental Beliefs About Blood, And Not Its Smell, Affect Presence In A Violent Computer Game","Presence in virtual reality - the feeling that one is inside mediated reality - has fascinated academics in the field of virtual reality from its onset. While conceptual analyses and empirical research unequivocally stressed the importance of immersion through sensory input, agent-related aspects such as mental beliefs received less attention. We are the first to examine the separate and combined effects of being exposed to the smell of a particular stimulus and/or having a representation of this stimulus in mind. Blood was considered to be interesting to work with, because of widespread folk ideas about its capacity to induce aggression in violent contexts. Using a violent computer game in a between-subjects design, male subjects were tested for the immersive impact of blood, first as an olfactory cue, and second as a mental belief, i.e. the true or false belief that one is smelling 'blood'. Lower skin conductance and game scores showed that 'blood' served as a distractor hindering the subject's spontaneous engagement. Subjects higher in dispositional aggressiveness, however, got more immersed during the 'blood' game rounds, by displaying more combativeness. We discuss our results in light of the undervalued importance of subjective realism in research on presence, and explain the relevance of this work for applications in virtual training in the military and for clinical intervention in combat-related PTSD. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.chb.2016.06.012,Scopus,Computers in Human Behavior,"Verplaetse J., De Smet D.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Metabolic Responses To Wii Fit ™ Video Games At Different Game Levels,"The Wii Fit ™ is a form of interactive gaming designed to elicit health and fitness benefits to replace sedentary gaming. This study was designed to determine the effectiveness of Wii Fit ™ fitness games. The purpose of the study was to determine the %̇VO 2max and energy expenditure from different Wii Fit ™ games at different levels including the step and hula games. Eight healthy young women completed a preliminary trial to determine ̇VO 2max and later played the Wii Fit ™ during 2 separate counterbalanced trials. During each session, subjects played levels of Wii Fit ™ games for 10 minutes each level. One session involved beginning and intermediate hula, and the other session involved beginning and intermediate steps. The ̇VO 2 was measured continuously via metabolic cart, and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) was assessed at the end of each game level. The lowest %Vo 2max, kcal-min -1, and RPE occurred during the beginning step game and the highest values occurred during the intermediate hula game. Respiratory exchange ratio was significantly higher in the intermediate hula than beginning hula game but was not significantly different between step game levels. The intermediate hula and step games produced the greatest energy expenditure with an equivalent effect of a walking speed of &gt;5.63 km-h -1 (&lt;3.5 miles-h -1). This is the first study to determine the percentage of V̇O 2max and caloric expenditure elicited by different Wii Fit ™ video games at different game levels in adults. Findings suggest that the Wii Fit ™ can be used as an effective activity for promoting physical health in this population. © 2011 National Strength and Conditioning Association.",doi,10.1519/JSC.0b013e318207eae9,Scopus,Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research,"Worley J.R., Rogers S.N., Kraemer R.R.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Microcomputer Automated System For Measuring Systolic Time Intervals In Response To Exercise And A Psychophysiological Task,"A microcomputer automated system for measuring systolic time intervals is described. Electrocardiogram, phonocardiogram, and carotid pulse tracings were measured in 38 healthy male subjects during baseline conditions and during either exercise on a bicycle ergometer or a video‐game task. These measurements were recorded on both a traditional 3‐channel ECG recorder and the computerized system. Both methods of recording systolic time intervals were independently scored by two different experimenters. In this way, interrater reliability of hand‐scoring, intermethod reliability between hand‐scoring versus computer‐scoring, and interrater reliability of computer‐scoring could be assessed. The interrater reliabilities of hand‐scored systolic time intervals were generally above .90, ranging from .73 for left ventricular ejection time to .99 for R‐R intervals of the ECG, with a mean of .92. The intermethod reliability of the computer versus hand‐scored systolic time intervals also proved to be generally above .90, ranging from .76 for S1‐S2 components of the phonocardiogram to .99 for R‐R, with a mean of .94. The interrater reliabilities of the computer‐scored systolic time intervals were all above .90, ranging from .93 for S1‐S2 to .99 for R‐R, with a mean of .98. These data indicate that the computerized method of scoring systolic time intervals is at least as reliable as the more traditional scoring of paper tracing. Copyright © 1988, Wiley Blackwell.

,Might Virtual Reality Promote The Mood Benefits Of Exercise?,"This study sought to investigate if virtual reality technology enhances the psychological benefits of aerobic exercise in a laboratory setting. In this study, 88 university faculty and staff (44 females, 44 males) were randomly assigned to one of three 30-min conditions including: (1) bicycling at a moderate intensity (60-70% maximum heart rate) on a stationary bicycle, (2) playing a virtual reality computer bicycle game, or (3) an interactive virtual reality bicycle experience on a computer while exercising on a stationary bike at moderate intensity (60-70% maximum heart rate). The Activation-Deactivation Adjective Check List (AD-ACL) was administered immediately before and after the laboratory session. Results suggest that virtual reality enhances some of the mood benefits when paired with exercise. Virtual reality when paired with exercise enhances enjoyment, energy, and reduces tiredness. Virtual reality without exercise was discovered to increase participants' tension, tiredness, and lower their energy level. Results suggest that the combination of virtual reality and exercise might improve some of the beneficial psychological effects of exercise compared with virtual reality or exercise alone. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

,Mirrored Morality: An Exploration Of Moral Choice In Video Games,"This exploratory study was designed to examine how players make moral choices in video games and what effects these choices have on emotional responses to the games. Participants (n=75) filled out a moral foundations questionnaire (MFQ) and then played through the first full act of the video game Fallout 3. Game play was recorded and content analyzed for the moral decisions made. Players also reported their enjoyment of and emotional reactions to the game and reflected on the decisions they made. The majority of players made moral decisions and behaved toward the nonplayer game characters they encountered as if these were actual interpersonal interactions. Individual differences in decision making were predicted by the MFQ. Behaving in antisocial ways did increase guilt, but had no impact on enjoyment. © Copyright 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2012.",doi,10.1089/cyber.2012.0235,Scopus,"Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking","Weaver A.J., Lewis N.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Model-Free Learning Of Nash Games With Applications To Network Security,"We propose novel mathematical frameworks for model-free learning algorithms for games on complex systems with application to network security. We will use cyber-physical systems with sparse communication that can however yield global mission and provide formal optimality and robustness guarantees. Given the presence of modeling uncertainties, the unavailability of the model, the possibility of cooperative/noncooperative goals, and malicious attacks compromising the security of networked teams, there is a need for completely model-free plug-and-play approaches that respond to situations not programmed or anticipated in the design, so as to guarantee mission completion. We will be inspired by the prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia of the human brain and will combine interdisciplinary ideas from different fields (ie, computational intelligence, game theory, control theory, and information theory) to develop new self-configuring algorithms for decision and control given the unavailability of a model, the presence of enemy components, and the possibility of actuation and jamming network attacks. Because of the adaptive nature of the algorithms, the systems will be capable of breaking or splitting into parts that are themselves autonomous and resilient. The algorithms will be characterized by strong abilities of self-learning and adaptivity and will be implemented locally, and not globally, which implies that fewer sensors will be used for measurements. The approaches will be based on machine learning and especially in distributed actor-critic neural network structures, where the actor neural networks will approximate the optimal policies and the critic neural networks will approximate the optimal cost for each agent in the network. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

,More Than A Feeling: Measurement Of Sonic User Experience And Psychophysiology In A First-Person Shooter Game,"The combination of psychophysiological and psychometric methods provides reliable measurements of affective user experience (UX). Understanding the nature of affective UX in interactive entertainment, especially with a focus on sonic stimuli, is an ongoing research challenge. In the empirical study reported here, participants played a fast-paced, immersive first-person shooter (FPS) game modification, in which sound (on/off) and music (on/off) were manipulated, while psychophysiological recordings of electrodermal activity (EDA) and facial muscle activity (EMG) were recorded in addition to a Game Experience Questionnaire (GEQ). Results indicate no main or interaction effects of sound or music on EMG and EDA. However, a significant main effect of sound on all GEQ dimensions (immersion, tension, competence, flow, negative affect, positive affect, and challenge) was found. In addition, an interaction effect of sound and music on GEQ dimension tension and flow indicates an important relationship of sound and music for gameplay experience. Additionally, we report the results of a correlation between GEQ dimensions and EMG/EDA activity. We conclude subjective measures could advance our understanding of sonic UX in digital games, while affective tonic (i.e., long-term psychophysiological) measures of sonic UX in digital games did not yield statistically significant results. One approach for future affective psychophysiological measures of sonic UX could be experiments investigating phasic (i.e., event-related) psychophysiological measures of sonic gameplay elements in digital games. This could improve our general understanding of sonic UX beyond affective gaming evaluation. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",doi,10.1016/j.intcom.2010.04.005,Scopus,Interacting with Computers,"Nacke L.E., Grimshaw M.N., Lindley C.A.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Motivation And Physiologic Responses Of Playing A Physically Interactive Video Game Relative To A Sedentary Alternative In Children,"Background While there is emerging research outlining the physiologic cost of the physically interactive Nintendo Wii, there are no evaluations of the relative reinforcing value (RRV) of the Wii versus a sedentary alternative. Purpose The purpose of this study is to evaluate the physiologic cost, RRV, and liking of playing Wii Sports Boxing (Wii) versus a traditional sedentary video game (SVG) in 11 lean and 13 overweight/obese 8-to 12-yearold children. Methods Heart rate (HR) and VO2 were assessed during rest, treadmill walking, and playing an SVG and Wii using a counterbalance design. Liking was assessed during treadmill walking and video game play. RRV was assessed for Wii versus SVG. Results Average HR, VO2, and liking were significantly greater for Nintendo Wii (p≤0.001 for all) than all other conditions. Lean children displayed a greater (p≤0.001) peak responding for access to Wii relative to the SVG while overweight/obese children did not (p≥0.16). Conclusion Wii was a well-liked activity of greater physiologic intensity than both the SVG and treadmill walking. Lean children were more motivated while overweight/obese children were equally as motivated to play Wii relative to the SVG. © The Society of Behavioral Medicine 2010.",doi,10.1007/s12160-010-9164-x,Scopus,Annals of Behavioral Medicine,"Penko A.L., Barkley J.E.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,"Motivation, Sustained Attention, And Autonomic Regulation In School-Age Boys Exposed In Utero To Opiates And Alcohol","The effects of incentive on sustained attention and autonomic regulation among boys exposed in utero to opiates were studied. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), an indicator of autonomic regulation, was quantified during sustained attention in 3 groups of 7- to 12-year-old boys. RSA is a component of heart rate variability controlled by cortical influences and affected by changes in demand for attention. The Gordon Diagnostic System-Distractibility Task was performed with and without monetary reward. A cartoon task and a video game were used as measures of interest. Although opiate-exposed boys did not differ in performance as a function of incentive or interest, they had a tendency to perform more poorly overall across tasks. Alcohol exposure rather than opiate exposure covaried with autonomic regulation, with greater RSA decreases being associated with more alcohol exposure. Post hoc analyses revealed that the alcohol- and opiate-exposed boys responded with these hyperreactive RSA changes along with poorer performance.",doi,10.1037/1064-1297.5.4.375,Scopus,Experimental and Clinical Psychopharmacology,"Suess P.E., Newlin D.B., Porges S.W.",1997,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Multi-Modal System Architecture For Serious Gaming,"Human-computer interaction (HCI), especially in the games domain, targets to mimic as much as possible the natural human-to-human interaction, which is multimodal, involving speech, vision, haptic, etc. Furthermore, the domain of serious games, aiming to value-added games, makes use of additional inputs, such as biosensors, motion tracking equipment, etc. In this context, game development has become complex, expensive and burdened with a long development cycle. This creates barriers to independent game developers and inhibits the introduction of innovative games, or new game genres. In this paper the PlayMancer platform is introduced, a work in progress aiming to overcome such barriers by augmenting existing 3D game engines with innovative modes of interaction. Playmancer integrates open source existing systems, such as a game engine and a spoken dialog management system, extended by newly implemented components, supporting innovative interaction modalities, such as emotion recognition from audio data, motion tracking, etc, and advanced configuration tools. © 2009 International Federation for Information Processing.",doi,10.1007/978-1-4419-0221-4_52,Scopus,IFIP International Federation for Information Processing,"Kocsis O., Ganchev T., Mporas I., Papadopoulos G., Fakotakis N.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,"Narrative Structures In Computer And Video Games: Part 1: Context, Definitions, And Initial Findings","This essay is the first of a two-part article examining the use of narrative in computer and video games, which provides an overview and discussion of the definitions and representation of stories, plots, and narratives. A range of traditional and emerging narrative techniques are considered, including The Hero's Journey, three-act structure, the portrayal of human emotions, and character archetypes, from where an in-depth examination of interactive narrative is performed on a range of old and modern games. Initial results pertaining to the time allocated to narrative, the use of back stories, cut scenes, on-screen text, prompts, and game structure are also presented, which reveal a distinct level of uniformity of how interactive narrative is depicted in games spanning over two decades of industry development. The analysis is concluded in the second article, where further results are revealed to help uncover the precise nature of game narratives. © The Author(s) 2011.",doi,10.1177/1555412010364982,Scopus,Games and Culture,Ip B.,2011,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Need Satisfaction Supportive Game Features As Motivational Determinants: An Experimental Study Of A Self-Determination Theory Guided Exergame,"Empirical studies have validated that basic needs satisfaction supported by video game play predicts motivation and engagement outcomes. However, few studies specifically manipulated game features for each of the three basic needs specified in the self-determination theory (SDT) to examine how the game features impact players' need satisfaction and game experience. The current study employed an in-house developed exergame and manipulated the game features in a 2 (autonomy-supportive game features: on vs. off) × 2 (competence-supportive game features: on vs. off) experiment to predict need satisfaction, game enjoyment, motivation for future play, effort for gameplay, self-efficacy for exercise using the game, likelihood of game recommendation, and game rating. The manipulated game features led to the corresponding need satisfaction. Manipulated autonomy-supportive and competence-supportive game features had main effects on most motivation and engagement outcomes. Need satisfaction of autonomy and need satisfaction of competence were both found to be mediators for the relationships between the game features and the motivation and engagement outcomes. The findings add evidence to support the underlying mechanism postulated by SDT for media enjoyment and motivation as well as the emerging entertainment research conceptualizing enjoyment as need satisfaction. The findings also have practical implications for intervention effort that intends to capitalize the motivational pull of video games. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",doi,10.1080/15213269.2012.673850,Scopus,Media Psychology,"Peng W., Lin J.-H., Pfeiffer K.A., Winn B.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,"Needs, Pains, And Motivations In Autonomous Agents.","This paper presents the development of a motivated learning (ML) agent with symbolic I/O. Our earlier work on the ML agent was enhanced, giving it autonomy for interaction with other agents. Specifically, we equipped the agent with drives and pains that establish its motivations to learn how to respond to desired and undesired events and create related abstract goals. The purpose of this paper is to explore the autonomous development of motivations and memory in agents within a simulated environment. The ML agent has been implemented in a virtual environment created within the NeoAxis game engine. Additionally, to illustrate the benefits of an ML-based agent, we compared the performance of our algorithm against various reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in a dynamic test scenario, and demonstrated that our ML agent learns better than any of the tested RL agents.This paper presents the development of a motivated learning (ML) agent with symbolic I/O.

,Negative Feelings Exacerbate Hostile Attributions Of Intent In Highly Aggressive Boys,"Tested the hypothesis that aggressive boys' tendency to attribute hostile intentions to peers is exacerbated in a negative emotional state. Twenty-nine highly aggressive boys in special education, 12 moderately aggressive boys in regular education, and 16 nonaggressive boys in regular education inferred peers' intentions in 8 vignettes concerning ambiguous provocation by peers. Mild negative emotions were induced by unjust loss of a manipulated computer game. Half the vignettes were completed in this negative emotional state. After completion of all vignettes, the game was played again and won to reinduce positive feelings. Self-ratings of feelings obtained throughout the study showed the manipulations consecutively induced negative and positive feelings. Negative feelings increased hostile attribution of intent in the highly aggressive group.

,Network Formation Games And The Potential Function Method,"Large computer networks such as the Internet are built, operated, and used by a large number of diverse and competitive entities. In light of these competing forces, it is surprising how efficient these networks are. An exciting challenge in the area of algorithmic game theory is to understand the success of these networks in game theoretic terms: what principles of interaction lead selfish participants to form such efficient networks? In this chapter we present a number of network formation games. We focus on simple games that have been analyzed in terms of the efficiency loss that results from selfishness. We also highlight a fundamental technique used in analyzing inefficiency in many games: the potential function method. Introduction The design and operation of many large computer networks, such as the Internet, are carried out by a large number of independent service providers (Autonomous Systems), all of whom seek to selfishly optimize the quality and cost of their own operation. Game theory provides a natural framework for modeling such selfish interests and the networks they generate. These models in turn facilitate a quantitative study of the trade-off between efficiency and stability in network formation. In this chapter, we consider a range of simple network formation games that model distinct ways in which selfish agents might create and evaluate networks. © Noam Nisan, Tim Roughgarden, Éva Tardos, Vijay V.

,Neural Activity During Emotion Recognition After Combined Cognitive Plus Social Cognitive Training In Schizophrenia,"Cognitive remediation training has been shown to improve both cognitive and social cognitive deficits in people with schizophrenia, but the mechanisms that support this behavioral improvement are largely unknown. One hypothesis is that intensive behavioral training in cognition and/or social cognition restores the underlying neural mechanisms that support targeted skills. However, there is little research on the neural effects of cognitive remediation training. This study investigated whether a 50 h (10-week) remediation intervention which included both cognitive and social cognitive training would influence neural function in regions that support social cognition. Twenty-two stable, outpatient schizophrenia participants were randomized to a treatment condition consisting of auditory-based cognitive training (AT) [Brain Fitness Program/auditory module ~. 60 min/day] plus social cognition training (SCT) which was focused on emotion recognition [~. 5-15 min per day] or a placebo condition of non-specific computer games (CG) for an equal amount of time. Pre and post intervention assessments included an fMRI task of positive and negative facial emotion recognition, and standard behavioral assessments of cognition, emotion processing, and functional outcome. There were no significant intervention-related improvements in general cognition or functional outcome. fMRI results showed the predicted group-by-time interaction. Specifically, in comparison to CG, AT. +. SCT participants had a greater pre-to-post intervention increase in postcentral gyrus activity during emotion recognition of both positive and negative emotions. Furthermore, among all participants, the increase in postcentral gyrus activity predicted behavioral improvement on a standardized test of emotion processing (MSCEIT: Perceiving Emotions). Results indicate that combined cognition and social cognition training impacts neural mechanisms that support social cognition skills. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",doi,10.1016/j.schres.2012.05.009,Scopus,Schizophrenia Research,"Hooker C.I., Bruce L., Fisher M., Verosky S.C., Miyakawa A., Vinogradov S.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Neural Correlates Of Social Cooperation And Non-Cooperation As A Function Of Psychopathy,"Background: Psychopathy is a disorder involving a failure to experience many emotions that are necessary for appropriate social behavior. In this study, we probed the behavioral, emotional, and neural correlates of psychopathic traits within the context of a dyadic social interaction. Methods: Thirty subjects were imaged with functional magnetic resonance imaging while playing an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma game with human confederates who were outside the scanner. Subjects also completed two self-report psychopathy questionnaires. Results: Subjects scoring higher on psychopathy, particularly males, defected more often and were less likely to continue cooperating after establishing mutual cooperation with a partner. Further, they experienced more outcomes in which their cooperation was not reciprocated (cooperate-defect outcome). After such outcomes, subjects scoring high in psychopathy showed less amygdala activation, suggesting weaker aversive conditioning to those outcomes. Compared with low-psychopathy subjects, subjects higher in psychopathy also showed weaker activation within orbitofrontal cortex when choosing to cooperate and showed weaker activation within dorsolateral prefrontal and rostral anterior cingulate cortex when choosing to defect. Conclusions: These findings suggest that whereas subjects scoring low on psychopathy have emotional biases toward cooperation that can only be overcome with effortful cognitive control, subjects scoring high on psychopathy have an opposing bias toward defection that likewise can only be overcome with cognitive effort. © 2007 Society of Biological Psychiatry.",doi,10.1016/j.biopsych.2006.07.021,Scopus,Biological Psychiatry,"Rilling J.K., Glenn A.L., Jairam M.R., Pagnoni G., Goldsmith D.R., Elfenbein H.A., Lilienfeld S.O.",2007,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Neural Correlates Of Social Exclusion During Adolescence: Understanding The Distress Of Peer Rejection,"Developmental research has demonstrated the harmful effects of peer rejection during adolescence; however, the neural mechanisms responsible for this salience remain unexplored. In this study, 23 adolescents were excluded during a ball-tossing game in which they believed they were playing with two other adolescents during an fMRI scan; in reality, participants played with a preset computer program. Afterwards, participants reported their exclusion-related distress and rejection sensitivity, and parents reported participants' interpersonal competence. Similar to findings in adults, during social exclusion adolescents displayed insular activity that was positively related to self-reported distress, and right ventrolateral prefrontal activity that was negatively related to self-reported distress. Findings unique to adolescents indicated that activity in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (subACC) related to greater distress, and that activity in the ventral striatum related to less distress and appeared to play a role in regulating activity in the subACC and other regions involved in emotional distress. Finally, adolescents with higher rejection sensitivity and interpersonal competence scores displayed greater neural evidence of emotional distress, and adolescents with higher interpersonal competence scores also displayed greater neural evidence of regulation, perhaps suggesting that adolescents who are vigilant regarding peer acceptance may be most sensitive to rejection experiences. © The Author (2009).

,"Neural Signatures Of Economic Parameters During Decision-Making: A Functional Mri (Fmri), Electroencephalography (Eeg) And Autonomic Monitoring Study","Adaptive behaviour requires an ability to obtain rewards by choosing between different risky options. Financial gambles can be used to study effective decisionmaking experimentally, and to distinguish processes involved in choice option evaluation from outcome feedback and other contextual factors. Here, we used a paradigm where participants evaluated 'mixed' gambles, each presenting a potential gain and a potential loss and an associated variable outcome probability. We recorded neural responses using autonomic monitoring, electroencephalography (EEG) and functional neuroimaging (fMRI), and used a univariate, parametric design to test for correlations with the eleven economic parameters that varied across gambles, including expected value (EV) and amount magnitude. Consistent with behavioural economic theory, participants were risk-averse. Gamble evaluation generated detectable autonomic responses, but only weak correlations with outcome uncertainty were found, suggesting that peripheral autonomic feedback does not play a major role in this task. Long-latency stimulus-evoked EEG potentials were sensitive to expected gain and expected value, while alpha-band power reflected expected loss and amount magnitude, suggesting parallel representations of distinct economic qualities in cortical activation and central arousal. Neural correlates of expected value representation were localized using fMRI to ventromedial prefrontal cortex, while the processing of other economic parameters was associated with distinct patterns across lateral prefrontal, cingulate, insula and occipital cortices including default-mode network and early visual areas. These multimodal data provide complementary evidence for distributed substrates of choice evaluation across multiple, predominantly cortical, brain systems wherein distinct regions are preferentially attuned to specific economic features. Our findings extend biologically-plausible models of risky decision-making while providing potential biomarkers of economic representations that can be applied to the study of deficits in motivational behaviour in neurological and psychiatric patients. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",doi,10.1007/s10548-011-0210-1,Scopus,Brain Topography,"Minati L., Grisoli M., Franceschetti S., Epifani F., Granvillano A., Medford N., Harrison N.A., Piacentini S., Critchley H.D.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Neurocircuits Underlying Cognition-Emotion Interaction In A Social Decision Making Context,"Decision making (DM) in the context of others often entails complex cognition-emotion interaction. While the literature suggests that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), striatum, and amygdala are involved in valuation-based DM and hippocampus in context processing, how these neural mechanisms subserve the integration of cognitive and emotional values in a social context remains unclear. In this study we addressed this gap by systematically manipulating cognition-emotion interaction in a social DM context, when the participants played a card game with a hypothetical opponent in a behavioral study (n = 73) and a functional magnetic-resonance-imaging study (n = 16). We observed that payoff-based behavioral choices were influenced by emotional values carried by face pictures and identified neurocircuits involved in cognitive valuation, emotional valuation, and concurrent cognition-emotion value integration. Specifically, while the vmPFC, amygdala, and ventral striatum were all involved in both cognitive and emotional domains of valuation, these regions played dissociable roles in social DM. The payoff-dependent responses in vmPFC and amygdala, but not ventral striatum, were moderated by the social context. Furthermore, the vmPFC, but not amygdala, not only encoded the opponent's gains as if self's losses, but also represented a ""final common currency"" during valuation-based decisions. The extent to which emotional input influenced choices was associated with the functional connectivity between the value-signaling amygdala and value integrating vmPFC, and also with the functional connectivity between the context-setting hippocampus and value-signaling amygdala and ventral striatum. These results identify brain pathways through which emotion shapes subjective values in a social DM context. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",doi,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.07.017,Scopus,NeuroImage,"Ho S.S., Gonzalez R.D., Abelson J.L., Liberzon I.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Ninja Kitchen To The Rescue: Evaluation Of A Food Safety Education Game For Middle School Youth,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to assess the effect of Ninja Kitchen, a food safety educational video game, on middle school students' food safety knowledge, psychographic characteristics, and usual and intended behaviors. Design/methodology/approach: The experimental group (n=903) completed the following activities about one week apart from each other: pretest, played the game, posttest, and follow-up test. The control group (n=365) completed the same activities at similar intervals but did not have access to the game until after the follow-up test. Findings: Linear mixed-effects models, controlling for gender, grade, and geographic location revealed significant time by group effects for knowledge of safe cooking temperatures for animal proteins and danger zone hazard prevention, and usual produce washing behaviors. Pairwise comparisons, adjusted for multiple comparisons, indicated that after playing the game, the experimental group felt more susceptible to foodborne illness, had stronger attitudes toward the importance of handling food safely and handwashing, had greater confidence in their ability to practice safe food handling, and had greater intentions to practice handwashing and safe food handling. Teachers and students found the game highly acceptable. Originality/value: The game has the potential to promote positive food safety behaviors among youth, in a fun and educational format. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",doi,10.1108/00070701311331481,Scopus,British Food Journal,"Quick V., Corda K.W., Chamberlin B., Schaffner D.W., Byrd-Bredbenner C.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Nirs Study Of The Effects Of Computerized Brain Training Games For Cognitive Rehabilitation Of Major Depressive Disorder Patients In Remission: A Pilot Study,"We used functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) to estimate brain activity in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) patients (in remission), while they played a computerized brain training games for cognitive rehabilitation. MDD is characterized by marked deterioration in affect as well as significant impairment in cognitive function. It was found, that depressed patients showed long-lasting impaired cognitive performance on cognitive demanding tasks despite significant improvement in the depression symptoms. Previous studies have shown that video games can improve cognitive functions. But assessment was made only with cognitive tests. The main objective of this research was to study the effects of brain training games on cognitive functions of MDD patients in remission with objective instrumental NIRS method. Tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) and absolute concentrations of oxyhemoglobin ([O2Hb]), deoxyhemoglobin ([HHb]) and total hemoglobin ([tHb]) were measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) - Oxyprem (BORL, Zurich, Switzerland).

,Nutrition Science And Behavioral Theories Integrated In A Serious Game For Adolescents,"Purpose. Serious games have demonstrated positive effects on adolescent eating and physical activity. The purpose of this paper is to describe how constructs from social cognitive theory (SCT) and self-determination theory (SDT) were operationalized in the development of the serious game CREATURE 101 (C-101) to engage players in acquiring motivation, knowledge, skills, and personal agency. Approach. C-101 was developed from an evaluated nutrition and science curriculum for middle school youth, Choice, Control & Change (C3). Its behavior change goals are three pairs of “increase/decrease” behaviors: increase water / decease sweetened beverages, increase fruit and vegetables / decrease processed snacks (chips, candy etc), and increase physical activity (light, medium, intense) / decrease recreational screen time (watching TV, playing video games for fun) through a “virtual companion care” motif where the players bring their adopted creatures back to health. increase water / decease sweetened beverages, increase fruit and vegetables / decrease processed snacks (chips, candy etc), and increase physical activity (light, medium, intense) / decrease recreational screen time (watching TV, playing video games for fun) through a “virtual companion care” motif where the players bring their adopted creatures back to health. Several procedures or strategies were used to develop the story line and activities in C-101 to address autonomy, competence and relatedness from SDT and outcome expectations, self-efficacy, and behavioral capability from SCT, constructs shown in previous studies as likely to enhance effectiveness of nutrition and physical activity interventions. Implications. This description of how the theory constructs and procedures were used to create an entertaining serious game based on an existing evaluated health-related curriculum can help game developers, curriculum developers, and educators who wish to expand existing curricula through the development and integration of games into their work. © 2015, © 2015 SAGE Publications.",doi,10.1177/1046878115577163,Scopus,Simulation and Gaming,"Majumdar D., Koch P.A., Lee Gray H., Contento I.R., de Lourdes Islas-Ramos A., Fu D.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Of Beard Physics And Worldness: The (Non-)Effect Of Enhanced Anthropomorphism On Player-Avatar Relations.,"Advances in realistic graphics and artificial intelligence are hallmarks of evolved video games, as environments and characters are made to seem more real. Little is known, however, about whether or not character model changes may impact players' relationships with familiar avatars, especially since anthropomorphism-the perception of nonhuman objects as being human or humanlike-is understood as central to player-avatar interaction (PAX). This study leveraged a naturally occurring change to massively multiplayer online game avatars to conduct a field quasiexperiment to investigate whether enhanced avatar anthropomorphism influences PAX dimensions: emotional investment, anthropomorphic autonomy, suspension of disbelief, and sense of control. Longitudinal analysis showed that enhanced anthropomorphism had no significant impact on any PAX dimension immediately or over time, when controlling for demographic and gameplay variables. Player comments suggest the change was experienced not as a change in humanness, but as a shift in perceptual realism-believability, lifelikeness, depth-that impacted the experience of the avatar-mediated gameworld more broadly.

,Older Persons’ Tv Viewing Patterns And Motivations,"Television viewing motivations and viewing patterns were examined for a sample of 340 aging and aged persons. Correlational relations between viewing motivations and viewing patterns were evident. Viewing motivations were found to be intercorrelated and canonical analysis located associations among viewing motivations and patterns. Companionship, habit, relaxation, arousal, escape, pass time, and product advertising motivations were interrelated and associated with increased television affinity, viewing levels, and game show and daytime serial watching. Information and entertainment motivations were interrelated and associated with news, documentary-magazine, and talk-interview program viewing. Multiple regression analysis determined that the salience of habit, pass time, and entertainment viewing motivations contributed to increased viewing levels; the salience of habit, companionship, product advertising, and entertainment viewing motivations contributed to increased television affinity. Implications of the findings for aging and mass communication research were discussed. © 1982, Sage.

,Online Multiplayer Games: A Powerful Tool For Learning Communication And Teamwork,"This chapter describes an online video teleconferencing tool the authors have created that allows learners to collaborate, negotiate, discuss, share ideas and emotions, and establish relationships while engaged in educational games and simulations. The ENJEUX-S (L'Environnement multimédia évolué de JEUX éducatifs et de Simulations en ligne) multimedia environment relies on Web Services for the management and operation of online games and simulations and on real-time communication services (audio- and video-conferencing, chat) to support a collaborative working environment for players. The authors first describe the components of ENJEUX-S, their technological choices, and the environment's architecture. Then, they present the results of ENJEUX-S testing to correct problems and measure ease of use and functionality for target users. Finally, they outline the pedagogical contributions of such an environment in the context of online games and simulations, notably to development of interpersonal competencies including cooperation, communication, and teamwork. © 2010, IGI Global.",doi,10.4018/978-1-61520-731-2.ch012,Scopus,Educational Gameplay and Simulation Environments: Case Studies and Lessons Learned,"Sauvé L., Villardier L., Probst W.",2010,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Operation Analysis Of Massively Multiplayer Online Games On Unreliable Resources,"We investigate the use of a new Massively Multiplayer Online Gaming (MMOG) ecosystem consisting of end-users, game providers, game operators, and Cloud resource providers, for autonomous, self-adaptive hosting and operation of MMOGs on unreliable resources. For this purpose, we developed an MMOG simulator compliant with our ecosystem, supported by a dynamic resource provisioning and load balancing algorithm. Using our simulator in which we inject traces collected from a real-world MMOG and resource characteristics from 16 Cloud providers, we study the impact on the involved actors by considering different resource availability levels. We highlight the advantages of dynamic resource allocation over the static overprovisioning with respect to two types of metrics: QoS offered to the clients and financial profit of game providers and operators. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",doi,10.1007/s12083-015-0383-6,Scopus,Peer-to-Peer Networking and Applications,"Prodan R., Iosup A.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Orders To Shoot (A Camera): Effects Of Ostracism On Obedience,"Research suggests that ostracism increases susceptibility to indirect forms of social influence (e.g., conformity). Yet, no study to date has explored whether the effects of ostracism extend to the most direct form of social influence - obedience. We investigated whether ostracized individuals would be more likely to obey a direct command to do something effortful in uncomfortable conditions. Participants (N = 62) were randomly assigned to be included or ostracized in Cyberball, or assigned to a control condition. They were then approached by the experimenter and commanded to go outside when temperatures were below 30°F and take 39 unique and creative photographs in the cold of winter. Ostracized participants were more likely to obey the experimenters command to be creative when taking photographs. No differences in obedience emerged between the inclusion and the control condition. We provided evidence completing the social influence ""trifecta"": ostracism increases susceptibility to conformity, compliance, and now, obedience. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",doi,10.1080/00224545.2014.883354,Scopus,Journal of Social Psychology,"Riva P., Williams K.D., Torstrick A.M., Montali L.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Pain Processing After Social Exclusion And Its Relation To Rejection Sensitivity In Borderline Personality Disorder,"Objective: There is a general agreement that physical pain serves as an alarm signal for the prevention of and reaction to physical harm. It has recently been hypothesized that ""social pain,"" as induced by social rejection or abandonment, may rely on comparable, phylogenetically old brain structures. As plausible as this theory may sound, scientific evidence for this idea is sparse. This study therefore attempts to link both types of pain directly. We studied patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) because BPD is characterized by opposing alterations in physical and social pain; hyposensitivity to physical pain is associated with hypersensitivity to social pain, as indicated by an enhanced rejection sensitivity. Method: Twenty unmedicated female BPD patients and 20 healthy participants (HC, matched for age and education) played a virtual ball-tossing game (cyberball), with the conditions for exclusion, inclusion, and a control condition with predefined game rules. Each cyberball block was followed by a temperature stimulus (with a subjective pain intensity of 60% in half the cases). The cerebral responses were measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging. The Adult Rejection Sensitivity Questionnaire was used to assess rejection sensitivity. Results: Higher temperature heat stimuli had to be applied to BPD patients relative to HCs to reach a comparable subjective experience of painfulness in both groups, which suggested a general hyposensitivity to pain in BPD patients. Social exclusion led to a subjectively reported hypersensitivity to physical pain in both groups that was accompanied by an enhanced activation in the anterior insula and the thalamus. In BPD, physical pain processing after exclusion was additionally linked to enhanced posterior insula activation. After inclusion, BPD patients showed reduced amygdala activation during pain in comparison with HC. In BPD patients, higher rejection sensitivity was associated with lower activation differences during pain processing following social exclusion and inclusion in the insula and in the amygdala. Discussion: Despite the similar behavioral effects in both groups, BPD patients differed from HC in their neural processing of physical pain depending on the preceding social situation. Rejection sensitivity further modulated the impact of social exclusion on neural pain processing in BPD, but not in healthy controls. Copyright: © 2015 Bungert et al.

,"Pc-Pvt: A Platform For Psychomotor Vigilance Task Testing, Analysis, And Prediction","Using a personal computer (PC) for simple visual reaction time testing is advantageous because of the relatively low hardware cost, user familiarity, and the relative ease of software development for specific neurobehavioral testing protocols. However, general-purpose computers are not designed with the millisecond-level accuracy of operation required for such applications. Software that does not control for the various sources of delay may return reaction time values that are substantially different from the true reaction times. We have developed and characterized a freely available system for PC-based simple visual reaction time testing that is analogous to the widely used psychomotor vigilance task (PVT). In addition, we have integrated individualized prediction algorithms for near-real-time neurobehavioral performance prediction. We characterized the precision and accuracy with which the system as a whole measures reaction times on a wide range of computer hardware configurations, comparing its performance with that of the ""gold standard"" PVT-192 device. We showed that the system is capable of measuring reaction times with an average delay of less than 10 ms, a margin of error that is comparable to that of the gold standard. The most critical aspect of hardware selection is the type of mouse used for response detection, with gaming mice showing a significant advantage over standard ones.

,Perception Of The Prosody And Content Of Sentences In An Unfamiliar Language In Children With Autism Spectrum Disorders,"Prior research suggests that children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) show atypical patterns of attention to the prosody (intonation and emotional tone of voice) and content (words) of spoken sentences. Using a discrimination-choice procedure embedded in a custom-made videogame, we examined attention to these features of sentences in 15 children with ASD (ages 5 years, 5 months-18 years) and 15 age-matched typical controls (TYP). Using an unfamiliar language (German) to remove semantics, we assessed the role of meaning in promoting attention to content over prosody. As in a previous study with English sentences, TYP children attended to content to a greater extent than children with ASD while maintaining equivalent levels of discrimination based on prosody. However, in contrast to previous results, TYP children did not show a preference for enthusiastic over grouchy tone of voice, which suggests that the unfamiliar language rendered affective valence less salient. The results confirm intact perception of prosody in children with ASD, and a more selective pattern of attention to content in TYP children. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.rasd.2014.03.014,Scopus,Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders,"Ploog B.O., Brooks P.J., Scharf A., Aum S.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,"Personality Factors, Subject Gender, And The Effects Of Aggressive Video Games On Aggression In Adolescents","Male and female adolescents served as subjects in an experiment designed to assess the relationship among personality factors, heart rate, and aggression after having played an aggressive video game. For males, personality traits and heart rate were separately related to aggression. Personality characteristics similar to those of the Type A individual were related in a positive direction to heart rate in females. The content of the video games did not affect heart rate or postgame aggression, even though females displayed greater mean heart rate than males throughout the experiment. The results are discussed with regard to sex role stereotypes, content-related explanations of aggression, and Type A personality characteristics. That teenagers may be mimicking the violence in video games was not supported. © 1987.",doi,10.1016/0092-6566(87)90008-0,Scopus,Journal of Research in Personality,"Winkel M., Novak D.M., Hopson H.",1987,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Personality Trait And Facial Expression Filter-Based Brain-Computer Interface,"In this paper, we present technical approaches that bridge the gap in the research related to the use of braincomputer interfaces for entertainment and facial expressions. Such facial expressions that reflect an individual's personal traits can be used to better realize artificial facial expressions in a gaming environment based on a brain-computer interface. First, an emotion extraction filter is introduced in order to classify emotions on the basis of the users' brain signals in real time. Next, a personality trait filter is defined to classify extrovert and introvert types, which manifest as five traits: very extrovert, extrovert, medium, introvert and very introvert. In addition, facial expressions derived from expression rates are obtained by an extrovert-introvert fuzzy model through its defuzzification process. Finally, we confirm this validation via an analysis of the variance of the personality trait filter, a k-fold cross validation of the emotion extraction filter, an accuracy analysis, a user study of facial synthesis and a test case game. © 2013 Chin and Lee.",doi,10.5772/55665,Scopus,International Journal of Advanced Robotic Systems,"Chin S., Lee C.-Y.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,"Personality, Parental, And Media Influences On Aggressive Personality And Violent Crime In Young Adults.","Debate remains regarding the interaction between predictor variables for aggression, including family environment, media violence, and personality. The current study examined the contributions of gender and personality, exposure to physical abuse and violence in the family, and exposure to media violence in both television and in video games on violent criminal activity. Data from young adults (n = 355) indicated that personality characteristics and direct physical abuse significantly predicted violent crime. Exposure to television and video game violence were not significant predictors of violent crime. These results elucidate the complex interplay between multiple factors related to the etiology of violent crime.

,Pharmacologic And Tracer Methods To Study Sympathetic Function In Primary Hypertension,"Systemically infused tritiated norepinephrine (NE) was used to estimate total body NE spillover into arterial blood during mental challenge (playing a video game) in 18 young (mean age 35 years old) patients with essential hypertension and 20 normotensives of similar age. Arterial NE, epinephrine (E), and total body NE spillover at baseline did not differ between the groups. During the game, total body NE spillover increased significantly in both groups, with the increments related directly to the pressor responses. Mean increments in total body NE spillover, arterial E, and mean arterial pressure were larger in the hypertensives (204 vs 91 ng/min, 33 vs 9 pg/ml, and 16 vs 12 mm Hg). The hypertensives increased total peripheral resistance during the game, whereas the normotensive group did not. Intravenous administration of yohimbine was used to increase NE spillover. Pressor responses to yohimbine were related to responses of arterial NE. The hypertensive group had a larger mean increment in blood pressure and arterial NE than did the normotensive group during yohimbine, due to excessive responses in a subgroup of about 1/3 of the patients. Patients with essential hypertension can have excessive sympathoadrenomedullary responsiveness related to excessive pressor responses, even when sympathoadrenomedullary activity at rest is normal. © 1989 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.",doi,10.3109/10641968909045422,Scopus,Clinical and Experimental Hypertension,"Goldstein D.S., Eisenhofer G., Garty M., Sax F.L., Keiser H.R., Kopin I.J., Folio C.J., Stull R., Chidakel B.",1989,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,"Physical Activity, Sedentary Behaviors, And Retinal Vascular Caliber In Children And Adolescents With Type 1 Diabetes","Purpose: The aimof this study was to investigate associations of physical activity and sedentary behaviors with retinal vascular caliber in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. Design: This was a hospital-based cross-sectional study. Methods: A study of 122 children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes was conducted over an 8-month period. Self-reported physical activity time and time spent watching TVor playing computer or video games were obtained using interviewer-Administered questionnaires. Retinal vascular caliber was measured by a trained grader using a standardized protocol and later summarized as central retinal artery equivalent (CRAE) and central retinal vein equivalent (CRVE) using a semiautomated computer program. Results: After adjusting for confounders (age, sex, ethnicity, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, HbA1c, maternal smoking status, age at which cow'smilk was introduced, and CRVE/CRAE, respectively), narrower CRAE was independently related to more time spent playing computer/ video games [ExpB = -3.85; 95% confidence interval (CI), -6.41 to -1.29; P = 0.004], whereas wider CRVE was independently related to lower physical activity level (ExpB = -1.08; 95% CI, -2.01 to -0.15; P = 0.03) and more time spent playing computer/video games (ExpB = 4.72; 95% CI, 0.52-8.92; P = 0.02). Television viewing time was not associated with retinal vascular caliber after adjustment. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that physical activity and sedentary behaviors in the form of ""screen viewing time"" are associated with retinal vessel caliber early in life. These results suggest that retinal vascular caliber may provide prognostic information beyond current traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Future longitudinal and interventional studies are warranted to evaluate the relevance of these observations.

,Physiological Compliance For Social Gaming Analysis: Cooperative Versus Competitive Play,"We report the results of an empirical study demonstrating the value of using physiological compliance as a measure of social presence during digital game playing. The physiological activity (facial EMG, electrodermal activity, cardiac activity and respiration) of 21 dyads were acquired synchronously while they were playing a digital game either cooperatively or competitively and either at home or in the laboratory. Physiological compliance was defined as the correlation between the physiological signals of the dyad members. The results of this study confirm that physiological compliance is higher in a conflicting situation than when playing cooperatively. Importantly, the results also demonstrate that physiological compliance is related to self-reported social presence. This suggests that physiological compliance is not limited to negative situations but rather increases due to rich interactions. Only minor differences in physiological compliance were observed between home play and laboratory play, suggesting the ecological validity of laboratory measures. Finally, we propose that compliance measures can be considered as objective indices of social presence in digital gaming. © 2012 British Informatics Society Limited.

,Physiological Responses During Exercise With Video Games In Patients With Cystic Fibrosis: A Systematic Review.,"Interactive video games are recently being used as an exercise tool in cystic fibrosis (CF). This study aimed to assess the literature describing whether video games generate a physiological response similar to the exercise intensity needed for training in CF. An online search in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, SciELO, LILACS and PEDro databases was conducted and original studies describing physiological responses of the use of video games as exercise in CF were included. In four, out of five studies, the heart rate achieved during video games was within the standards recommended for training (60-80%). Two studies assessed VO2 and showed higher levels compared to the six-minute walk test. No desaturation was reported. Most games were classified as moderate intensity. Only one study used a maximum exercise test as comparator.

,Physiological Responses During Multiplay Exergaming In Young Adult Males Are Game-Dependent,"Regular moderate-intensity exercise provides health benefits. The aim of this study was to examine whether the selected exercise intensity and physiological responses during exergaming in a single and multiplayer mode in the same physical space were game-dependent. Ten males (mean ±SD, age: 23 ±5 years, body mass: 84.2 ±15.6 kg, body height: 180 ±7 cm, body mass index: 26.0 ±4.0 kg·m-2) played the games Kinect football, boxing and track & field (3 × ~10 min, ~ 2 min rest periods) in similar time sequence in two sessions. Physiological responses were measured with the portable Cosmed K4b2 pulmonary gas exchange system. Single play demands were used to match with a competitive opponent in a multiplay mode. A within-subjects crossover design was used with one-way ANOVA and a post-hoc t-test for analysis (p<0.05). Minute ventilation, oxygen uptake and the heart rate were at least 18% higher during a multiplayer mode for Kinect football and boxing but not for track & field. Energy expenditure was 21% higher during multiplay football. Single play track & field had higher metabolic equivalent than single play football (5.7 ±1.6, range: 3.2-8.6 vs 4.1 ±1.0, range: 3.0-6.1, p<0.05). Exergaming in a multiplayer mode can provide higher physiological demands but the effects are game-dependent. It seems that exergaming with low intensity in a multiplayer mode may provide a greater physical challenge for participants than in a single play mode but may not consistently provide sufficient intensity to acquire health benefits when played regularly as part of a programme to promote and maintain health in young adults. © Stephen McGuire et al. 2015.",doi,10.1515/hukin-2015-0054,Scopus,Journal of Human Kinetics,"McGuire S., Willems M.E.T.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Planar Character Animation Using Genetic Algorithms And Gpu Parallel Computing,"The emergence of evolving search techniques (e.g., genetic algorithms) has paved the way for innovative character animation solutions. For example, generating human movements without key-frame data. Instead character animations can be created using biologically inspired algorithms in conjunction with physics-based systems. While the development of highly parallel processors, such as the graphical processing unit (GPU), has opened the door to performance accelerated techniques allowing us to solve complex physical simulations in reasonable time frames. The combined acceleration techniques in conjunction with sophisticated planning and control methodologies enable us to synthesize ever more realistic characters that go beyond pre-recorded ragdolls towards more self-driven problem solving avatars. While traditional data-driven applications of physics within interactive environments have largely been confined to producing puppets and rocks, we explore a constrained autonomous procedural approach. The core difficulty is that simulating an animated character is easy, while controlling one is more complex. Since the control problem is not confined to human type models, e.g., creatures with multiple legs, such as dogs and spiders, ideally there would be a way of producing motions for arbitrary physically simulated agents. This paper focuses on evolutionary genetic algorithms, compared to the traditional data-driven approach. We demonstrate generic evolutionary techniques that emulate physically-plausible and life-like animations for a wide range of articulated creatures in dynamic environments. We help address the computational bottleneck of the genetic algorithms by applying the method to a massively parallel computational environments, such as, the graphical processing unit (GPU). © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",doi,10.1016/j.entcom.2014.09.003,Scopus,Entertainment Computing,Kenwright B.,2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Pre-Meal Video Game Playing And A Glucose Preload Suppress Food Intake In Normal Weight Boys,"Increased food intake (FI) during television viewing has been reported in children, but it is unknown if this occurs following pre-meal video game playing (VGP). The objective was to determine the effect of pre-meal VGP for 30 min on subjective appetite and emotions, and FI in normal weight (NW) boys after a glucose or control preload. On four test mornings, NW boys (n = 19) received equally sweetened preloads of a non-caloric sucralose control or 50 g glucose in 250 mL of water, with or without VGP for 30 min. Food intake from an ad libitum pizza meal was measured immediately after. Subjective appetite was measured at 0, 15, 30, and 60 min. Subjective emotions were determined by visual analog scale at baseline and immediately before lunch. Both VGP (p = 0.023) and glucose (p < 0.001) suppressed FI. Pre-meal VGP compared with no-VGP, and glucose compared with the non-caloric control, decreased FI by 59 and 170 kcal, respectively. Subjective average appetite increased to 30 min (p = 0.003), but was lower after glucose (p = 0.01) in both the VGP and no-VGP conditions compared with the control. Frustration and aggression scores increased after VGP (p < 0.05), but did not correlate with FI. However, baseline and pre-meal happiness and excitement scores were inversely associated with FI. In conclusion, both pre-meal VGP and the glucose preload suppressed FI, supporting the roles of both physiologic and environmental factors in the regulation of short-term FI in 9- to 14-year-old NW boys. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.appet.2014.08.024,Scopus,Appetite,"Branton A., Akhavan T., Gladanac B., Pollard D., Welch J., Rossiter M., Bellissimo N.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Predicting Home And Work Blood Pressure Measurements From Resting Baselines And Laboratory Reactivity In Black And White Americans,"The relationship between blood pressure in the laboratory (both at rest and in response to laboratory tasks) and ambulatory blood pressure at home and at work was evaluated. One hundred nineteen normotensive and unmedicated mild‐moderate hypertensive black and white females and males participated in laboratory blood pressure monitoring at rest and during four challenging tasks (structured interview, video game, bicycle exercise, and cold pressor test) as well as ambulatory blood pressure monitoring while at home and at work. Baseline blood pressure taken while subjects were at rest was the strongest predictor of ambulatory systolic blood pressure (r=.64) and diastolic blood pressure (r=.77) at work. Among reactivity tasks the strongest predictors of ambulatory blood pressure in the total population were the structured interview and the video game (both psychological tasks) followed by the cold pressor test. Racial comparisons, however, determined that the cold pressor test predicted diastolic blood pressure significantly better for blacks (r=.73) than for whites (r=.40), suggesting a possible difference in blood pressure regulation.

,Predictive Cloud Computing With Big Data: Professional Golf And Tennis Forecasting [Application Notes],"Major Golf and Grand Slam Tennis tournaments such as Australian Open, The Masters, Roland Garros, United States Golf Association (USGA), Wimbledon, and United States Tennis Association (USTA) United States (US) Open provide real-time and historical sporting information to immerse a global fan base in the action. Each tournament provides realtime content, including streaming video, game statistics, scores, images, schedule of play, and text. Due to the game popularities, some of the web servers are heavily visited and some are not, therefore, we need a method to autonomously provision servers to provide a smooth user experience. Predictive Cloud Computing (PCC) has been developed to provide a smart allocation/deallocation of servers by combining ensembles of forecasts and predictive modeling to determine the future origin demand for web site content. PCC distributes processing through analytical pipelines that correlate streaming data, such as scores, media schedules, and player brackets with a future-siμlated tournament state to measure predicted demand spikes for content. Social data streamed from Twitter provides social sentiment and popularity features used within predictive modeling. Data at rest, such as machine logs and web content, provide additional features for forecasting. While the duration of each tournament varies, the number of origin website requests range from 29,000 to 110,000 hits per minute. The PCC technology was developed and deployed to all Grand Slam tennis events and several major golf tournaments that took place in 2013 and to the present, which has decreased wasted computing consumption by over 50%. We propose a novel forecasting ensemble that includes residual, vector, historical, partial, adjusted, cubic and quadratic forecasters. In addition, we present several predictive models based on μltiple Regression as inputs into several of these forecasters.

Study design: Eighty-eight healthy youths (mean age 10.9 ± 2.5 years; 52 blacks, 36 whites; 45 boys) were studied. During an initial visit anthropometric variables and hemodynamics were measured at rest and before, during, and after three laboratory stressors: postural change, forehead cold, and video game challenge. The subjects' ambulatory blood pressure was monitored for 24 hours as part of a follow-up evaluation an average of 2.5 years later. Results: Anthropometric and demographic variables and measures of reactivity to laboratory stressors were related to future daytime and nighttime ambulatory blood pressure. Conclusion: These findings provide important information on the predictors of ambulatory blood pressure and underscore the importance of resting blood pressure and adiposity. These results support the guidelines of the Second Task Force, which recommend the measurement of blood pressure and adiposity in the context of ongoing health care.",doi,10.1016/S0022-3476(98)70362-2,Scopus,Journal of Pediatrics,"Del Rosario J.D., Treiber F.A., Harshfield G.A., Davis H.S., Strong W.B.",1998,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,"Probabilistic Pursuit-Evasion Games: Theory, Implementation, And Experimental Evaluation","We consider the problem of having a team of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) pursue a second team of evaders while concurrently building a map in an unknown environment. We cast the problem in a probabilistic game theoretical framework, and consider two computationally feasible greedy pursuit policies: local-max and global-max. To implement this scenario on real UAVs and UGVs, we propose a distributed hierarchical hybrid system architecture which emphasizes the autonomy of each agent, yet allows for coordinated team efforts. We describe the implementation of the architecture on a fleet of UAVs and UGVs, detailing components such as high-level pursuit policy computation, map building and interagent communication, and low-level navigation, sensing, and control. We present both simulation and experimental results of real pursuit-evasion games involving our fleet of UAVs and UGVs, and evaluate the pursuit policies relating expected capture times to the speed and intelligence of the evaders and the sensing capabilities of the pursuers.",doi,10.1109/TRA.2002.804040,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation,"Vidal R., Shakernia O., Kim H.J., Shim D.H., Sastry S.",2002,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Protocols From Perceptual Observations,"This paper presents a cognitive vision system capable of autonomously learning protocols from perceptual observations of dynamic scenes. The work is motivated by the aim of creating a synthetic agent that can observe a scene containing interactions between unknown objects and agents, and learn models of these sufficient to act in accordance with the implicit protocols present in the scene. Discrete concepts (utterances and object properties), and temporal protocols involving these concepts, are learned in an unsupervised manner from continuous sensor input alone. Crucial to this learning process are methods for spatio-temporal attention applied to the audio and visual sensor data. These identify subsets of the sensor data relating to discrete concepts. Clustering within continuous feature spaces is used to learn object property and utterance models from processed sensor data, forming a symbolic description. The progol Inductive Logic Programming system is subsequently used to learn symbolic models of the temporal protocols presented in the presence of noise and over-representation in the symbolic data input to it. The models learned are used to drive a synthetic agent that can interact with the world in a semi-natural way. The system has been evaluated in the domain of table-top game playing and has been shown to be successful at learning protocol behaviours in such real-world audio-visual environments. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

,Prototyping N-Reasons: A Computer Mediated Ethics Machine,"Much work in machine ethics attempts to implement ethical theory in autonomous, situated machines – robots. Our previous work in robot ethics falls at the extreme of very simple virtual agents programmed with moral strategies for simple games (Danielson 1992). Even at this extreme, ethics is surprisingly complex. Our later evolvable agents discovered some strategies unexplored by the rational choice ethics literature (Danielson 1996; Danielson 1998; Danielson 2002). Twenty years ago, Dennett was skeptical of this branch of machine ethics: “[N]o remotely compelling system of ethics has ever been made computationally tractable, even indirectly, for real-world moral problems” (Dennett 1989, p. 129). We leave this approach to other contributors in this collection. In contrast, there is the branch of machine ethics that constructs machines to advise people making ethical decisions. Our present work falls here, or so we shall argue. We have developed an innovative survey research platform – N-Reasons – to explore robot ethics at the first level and machine ethics at the second. The question of interest for this volume is if the N-Reasons platform can be usefully seen as a machine. This contrast is interesting in another way relevant to our project. Working on Artificial Morality, the skeptical question I most often faced was, “How could a machine be moral?” The emerging technology of robotics, however, has caught up with some of this skepticism. © Cambridge University Press 2011.",doi,10.1017/CBO9780511978036.025,Scopus,Machine Ethics,Danielson P.,2011,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Providing Expressive Gaze To Virtual Animated Characters In Interactive Applications,"Eyes play an important role in communication among people. Motions of the eye express emotions and regulate the flow of conversation. Hence we consider fundamental that virtual humans or other characters present convincing and expressive gaze in applications such as Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs), games and movies. However, we perceive that in many applications that require automatic generation of facial movements, such as ECA, character's eye motion does not carry meaning related to its expressiveness. This work proposes a model for the automatic generation of expressive gaze by examining eye behavior in different affective states. To collect data related to gaze and expressiveness, we looked at Computer Graphics movies. This data was used as a basis to describe gaze expressions in the proposed model. We also implemented a prototype and performed some tests with users in order to observe the impact of eye behavior during some expressions of emotion. The results show that the model is capable of generating eye motions that are coherent with the affective states of the virtual character. © 2008 ACM.",doi,10.1145/1394021.1394034,Scopus,Computers in Entertainment,"Queiroz R.B., Barros L.M., Musse S.R.",2008,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Psychopathy And Selective Attention During Performance Of A Complex Perceptual‐Motor Task,"Autonomic and electrocortical activity were recorded while prison inmates with high (H) and low (L) ratings of psychopathy were presented with a series of binaural tone pips, either by themselves (passive attention) or while video games were being played (selective attention). During selective attention the subjects were told that the tone pips were irrelevant to the primary task, the video games. The N100 component of the auditory evoked potential was used as an index of attention paid to the tone pips, while performance on the video games was considered to be a reflection of attentiveness to the primary task. There were no group differences in N100 amplitude or latency during passive attention, supporting the results from several previous studies. During selective attention Group H gave small N100 responses to the tone pips during each video game trial, including the first one, while Group L gave large N100 responses to the tone pips during the first trial, and small responses during later trials. Both groups performed equally well during the first few trials, but while the performance of Group L continued to improve, that of Group H deteriorated over the last few trials. The results were interpreted in terms of limited capacity models of attention, and provided some support for the hypothesis that psychopaths allocate a relatively large proportion of their attentional resources to things of immediate interest, effectively ignoring other stimuli.

,Quantifying Rapid Changes In Cardiovascular State With A Moving Ensemble Average.,"MEAP, the moving ensemble analysis pipeline, is a new open-source tool designed to perform multisubject preprocessing and analysis of cardiovascular data, including electrocardiogram (ECG), impedance cardiogram (ICG), and continuous blood pressure (BP). In addition to traditional ensemble averaging, MEAP implements a moving ensemble averaging method that allows for the continuous estimation of indices related to cardiovascular state, including cardiac output, preejection period, heart rate variability, and total peripheral resistance, among others. Here, we define the moving ensemble technique mathematically, highlighting its differences from fixed-window ensemble averaging. We describe MEAP's interface and features for signal processing, artifact correction, and cardiovascular-based fMRI analysis. We demonstrate the accuracy of MEAP's novel B point detection algorithm on a large collection of hand-labeled ICG waveforms. As a proof of concept, two subjects completed a series of four physical and cognitive tasks (cold pressor, Valsalva maneuver, video game, random dot kinetogram) on 3 separate days while ECG, ICG, and BP were recorded. Critically, the moving ensemble method reliably captures the rapid cyclical cardiovascular changes related to the baroreflex during the Valsalva maneuver and the classic cold pressor response. Cardiovascular measures were seen to vary considerably within repetitions of the same cognitive task for each individual, suggesting that a carefully designed paradigm could be used to capture fast-acting event-related changes in cardiovascular state.",doi,10.1111/psyp.13018,pubmed,Psychophysiology,"Cieslak, Matthew; Ryan, William S; Babenko, Viktoriya; Erro, Hannah; Rathbun, Zoe M; Meiring, Wendy; Kelsey, Robert M; Blascovich, Jim; Grafton, Scott T",2017,NA,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Race/Ethnicity Determines The Relationships Between Oxidative Stress Markers And Blood Pressure In Individuals With High Cardiovascular Disease Risk,"Oxidative stress (OS) and cardiovascular (CV) reactivity are related to CV morbidity and mortality. However, little is known about the relationships between these CV risk factors and their confounders. We hypothesize that higher OS is linked to higher blood pressure (BP) reactivity to acute laboratory stressors and in the natural setting. We studied 137 subjects with a family history of hypertension and early myocardial infarction. There were 63 European Americans (EAs) (38 males) and 74 African Americans (AAs) (35 males), aged 19-36 (27.6±3.1). The protocol included a competitive video game, cold stressor and ambulatory BP recording. Blood samples were drawn six times for OS markers (8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and 8-Isoprostane) assay. Repeated measures analyses of covariance were used to test for mean differences and Pearson correlations were used to test OS and BP associations. There were no significant race/ethnicity differences in BP reactivity to either stressor (both P's>0.48). 8-OHdG levels were significantly lower across all time points for AAs than for EAs (P<0.05), while levels of 8-isoprostane did not differ significantly (P>0.10). Averaged 8-OHdG levels significantly correlated with systolic blood pressure (SBP) reactivity (r=0.45, <0.01) and 24-h, daytime and nighttime SBP (r range=0.37-0.42, all P's<0.02) for EAs but not for AAs, whereas 8-isoprostane levels were significantly correlated with reactive SBP and nighttime diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (both r's=0.38, P<0.01) for AAs but not for EAs. These findings suggest a link between OS and BP changes in subjects at high risk for CV disease (CVD). Further, race/ethnicity determines which OS marker will impact BP variation implying race/ethnicity differences in OS-related mechanisms of CVD.",doi,10.1038/jhh.2016.39,Scopus,Journal of Human Hypertension,"Kapuku G., Treiber F., Raouane F., Halbert J., Davis H., Young-Mayes S., Robinson V., Harshfield G.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Reappraising The Ultimatum: An Fmri Study Of Emotion Regulation And Decision Making,"Emotion regulation strategies provide a means by which to modulate our social behavior. In this study, we investigated the effect of using reappraisal to both up- And downregulate social decision making. After being instructed on how to use reappraisal, participants played the Ultimatum Game while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging and applied the strategies of upregulation (reappraising the proposer's intentions as more negative), down-regulation (reappraising the proposer's intentions as less negative), as well as a baseline ""look"" condition. As hypothesized, when reappraising, decision acceptance rates were altered, with a greater number of unfair offers accepted while down-regulating and a greater number of unfair offers rejected while upregulating, both relative to the baseline condition. At the neural level, during reappraisal, significant activations were observed in the inferior and middle frontal gyrus (MFG), in addition to the medial prefrontal cortex and cingulate gyrus for unfair offers only. Regulated decisions involved left inferior frontal gyrus for upregulation and MFG for down-regulation strategies, respectively. Importantly, the effects of emotion modulation were evident in posterior insula, with less activation for down-regulation and more activation for upregulation in these areas. Notably, we show for the first time that top-down strategies such as reappraisal strongly affect our socioeconomic decisions. © The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press.

,Relevance Of Videogames In The Learning And Development Of Young Children,"Introduction. The study was carried out with children of 2nd, 4th and 6th grades of elementary school in order to explore what and how will children learn from a completely new videogame. Method. We organized children from 2nd, 4th and 6th grades of elemental school , giving them chance to play a freshly released videogame by that time. We formed small groups of 4 players with 2 boys and 2 girls in each group. We offered them a console and only 2 controllers. With this design, we would like to observe and analyze the differences between these players according to their age and gender. This process of learning and playing videogames lasted for 11 weeks. Result. The results have shown the capacity of learning without adult's intervention among all the players in this study. It also shows the coordination of cooperation of each group in order to learn to play the video game. We'd like to highlight their autonomy in learning and their ability to solve different conflicts happened during the process in their group, from the beginning and during the play time, their way of regulate each player's play time and also their capacity of create meanings in the game's virtual world, characters or concrete actions. Discussion. Complex and important capacities were displayed during the learnig process by the children: leadership, caring for other players, control of the process, etc. © Education and Psychology I+D+i and Ilustre Colegio Oficial de la Psicología de Andalucía Oriental (Spain).",doi,10.14204/ejrep.36.14108,Scopus,Electronic Journal of Research in Educational Psychology,"Zhao Z., Linaza J.L.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Representing Emotive Meaning In Visual Images: A Social Semiotic Approach,"This study examines how emotive meaning is represented in visual images using the semiotic resources of facial expression, touch and body orientation. Complementing the cognitive metaphorical interpretation, the visually represented emotive behaviors are theorized as partial iconic representations of real life behaviors, which are in turn indexes of emotion. Adopting a social semiotic approach, this paper formulates facial expression, touch, and body orientation as inter-related systems of meaning, the selection and combination of which constitutes a systemic functional ""lexico-grammar"" for analyzing and interpreting meaning making in visual imagery. The systems are then used to explain how emotive meanings are represented in comic books. The analysis shows that cartoonists' systemic choices for representing emotions are largely consistent with the coding accuracy of facial behaviors on the one hand, and style guidelines advocated in comic handbooks on the other. Through the examination of both American and Japanese comics, it is demonstrated that the social semiotic lexico-grammatical approach is not only effective in explaining the emotion resources in nonverbal behavior, but also useful for investigating cultural differences in the visual depiction of emotion. The systemic choices also provide artists with a framework to ""design"" emotion in creative visual media such as comics, and possibly in computer vision, game design and related domains. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",doi,10.1016/j.pragma.2012.10.003,Scopus,Journal of Pragmatics,"Feng D., O'Halloran K.L.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia As An Index Of Parasympathetic Cardiac Control During Active Coping,"Psychophysiological studies concerning tonic cardiac responses to stressor tasks have tended to emphasize beta‐adrenergic effects and to neglect parasympathetic influences and sympathetic‐parasympathetic interactions. Much recent evidence indicates that both within‐ and between‐individual variations in cardiac parasympathetic heart rate (HR) control can be easily and reliably assessed by measuring the magnitude of respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). Therefore, we used RSA to index cardiac vagal responses to two active coping tasks. Both tasks consisted of the same video game, in one condition with threat of shock for inferior performance, and in the other without such threat. Twenty subjects underwent both tasks (counterbalanced over subjects), plus a preceding resting baseline period. HR and RSA were continuously measured. Results suggested that cardiac parasympathetic activity was diminished from rest to task, contributing to heart rate responses. Exaggerated HR responses were also associated with extreme parasympathetic withdrawal. Furthermore, task condition X sequence of presentation interaction effects showed that threat of shock was particularly effective in elevating HR and reducing RSA when the threat was presented during the first task condition. A repeated‐measures analysis of covariance of HR, attempting to remove the effects of parasympathetic influences upon HR, suggested that sympathetic influences upon HR exceeded any reciprocal vagal effects during the threat condition for those subjects exposed to the threat task first. The findings indicate the importance of considering stress‐related parasympathetic effects upon HR as well as sympathetic‐vagal interactions. Copyright © 1987, Wiley Blackwell.

,"Resuscitative Endovascular Balloon Occlusion Of The Aorta With A Low Profile, Wire Free Device: A Game Changer?","A 24 year old male arrived to our hospital after a motor cycle crash with evidence of a traumatic brain injury and in hemorrhagic shock not responsive to volume administration. Resuscitative Endovascular Balloon Occlusion of the Aorta (REBOA) was performed in a timely fashion using a new, low profile, wire free device. This lead to rapid reversal of hypotension while his bleeding source was sought and controlled. Recently, REBOA has emerged as an adjunct in the hypotensive trauma patient with noncompressible torso hemorrhage. As first described, this procedure makes use of commonly available vascular surgery and endovascular products requiring large introducer sheaths (12–14 French) and long guidewires. Concerns regarding this technique center around the safety and feasibility of using such equipment in the emergency setting outside an angiography suite. This has likely limited widespread adoption of this technique. To address these concerns, newer products designed to be placed through a smaller sheath (7 French) and without the use of guidewires have been developed. Here we report on our first clinical use of such a device that we believe represents a significant advance in the care of the trauma patient. © 2017 The Authors",doi,10.1016/j.tcr.2017.01.006,Scopus,Trauma Case Reports,"Bogert J.N., Davis K.M., Kopelman T.R., Vail S.J., Pieri P.G., Matthews M.R.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas

The results of Experiment 2 (n = 50) showed that participants with high non-verbal sensitivity experienced more positive valence and a greater level of arousal than participants with low non-verbal sensitivity. The biological sex of the participants became non-significant, after taking into consideration non-verbal sensitivity. The results of a mediation analysis showed that the emotional valence and arousal mediated the effects of non-verbal sensitivity on the enjoyment of the videogame. Implications with respect to a new understanding of gender preference for certain genres of videogames by identifying specific gender-related skills are discussed. © The Author 2014.",doi,10.1093/iwc/iwu024,Scopus,Interacting with Computers,"Jung Y., Oh H.J., Sng J., Kwon J.H., Detenber B.H.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Risk-Taking And The Media,"In recent years, media formats with risk-glorifying content, such as video games that simulate illegal street racing (""bang and crash"" games), films about extreme sports, and risky stunts have emerged as top sellers of the media industry. A variety of recent studies conducted by several researchers revealed that exposure to risk-glorifying media content (e.g., video games that simulate reckless driving, smoking and drinking in movies, or depictions that glorify extreme sports) increases the likelihood that recipients will show increased levels of risk-taking inclinations and behaviors. The present article (1) reviews the latest research on the detrimental impact of risk-glorifying media on risk-taking inclinations (cognitions, emotions, behaviors), (2) puts these findings in the theoretical context of recent sociocognitive models on media effects, and (3) makes suggestions to science and policymakers on how to deal with these effects in the future. © 2010 Society for Risk Analysis.",doi,10.1111/j.1539-6924.2010.01538.x,Scopus,Risk Analysis,"Fischer P., Vingilis E., Greitemeyer T., Vogrincic C.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Screen-Based Behaviors Of Children And Cardiovascular Risk Factors,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the amount of time spent in screen-based behaviors (SBBs; television viewing, computer use, and playing electronic games) is independently associated with individual and clustered cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors among elementary school children.STUDY DESIGN: Baseline data were used from 264 children (age 7-10 years) participating in the Transform-Us! cluster-randomized controlled trial. Time (h/d) spent in SBBs was obtained using a parent proxy-report questionnaire. Anthropometrics, blood pressure (BP), and lipids were measured using standard techniques. A clustered CVD risk score was calculated as the average of the standardized values of the subcomponents (waist circumference [WC], systolic BP, diastolic BP, and lipids).RESULTS: After adjusting for sex, parent education, physical activity (accelerometry), diet, and WC (when adiposity was not the outcome), television viewing time was positively associated with body mass index z-score (P = .002), WC (P = .02), and systolic BP (P = .05). Electronic games was positively associated with low density lipoprotein levels (P = .05), and total screen-time was positively associated with body mass index (P = .02).CONCLUSIONS: Differential associations were observed between types of SBBs and CVD risk factors, indicating that not all SBBs are adversely associated with obesity and CVD risk. There is a need to differentiate between types of SBBs when evaluating the CVD risk associated with screen behaviors in children.TRIAL REGISTRATION: International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial: ISRCTN83725066; Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: ACTRN12609000715279.

Methods: Data are for 2670, 3rd and 9th grade participants in Denmark, Portugal, Estonia and Norway collected between 1997 and 2000. Outcomes were spending > 2 h after-school watching television (TV) and > 1 h per day playing computer games. Child Autonomy and the home TV Environment were exposures. Results: Each unit increase in Child Autonomy was associated with 9% increase in risk of watching more than 2 h of TV per day after school and a 19% increase in risk of spending more than an hour per day playing computer games. TV Environment was associated with a 31% per unit increase in risk of watching > 2 h of TV after school and 11% increase in risk of spending > 1 h playing computer games. Conclusions: A family environment in which after-school TV viewing is part of the home culture and homes where children have more autonomy over their own behavior are associated with an increased risk of watching > 2 h of TV per day after school and spending more > 1 h per day playing computer games. The home screen-viewing environment and Child Autonomy may be malleable targets for changing screen-viewing. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

,Secretory Immunoglobulin A And Cardiovascular Responses To Acute Psychological Challenge,"Cardiovascular activity and secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) in saliva were recorded at rest, during a 30-min computer game task, and during subsequent recovery. Blood pressure (BP) rose and remained elevated during the task and returned to resting levels during recovery. This pressor response was produced by increased total peripheral resistance rather than increased cardiac output. SIgA secretion rate also increased during the task, although the effect proved significant only toward the end of the task. As such, the data provide preliminary indication that sIgA is sensitive to acute psychological challenge in the laboratory. Although correlational analyses revealed that sIgA reactions were stable, they were not significantly correlated with pressor reactions. The influence of task uncertainty was explored by comparing individuals who had previously played the computer game with those who had not. Task-induced increases in BP and sIgA were a feature of individuals new to the computer game. In contrast to these novice players, experienced players showed minimal increases in BP and no increases in sIgA.",doi,10.1207/s15327558ijbm0303_6,Scopus,International Journal of Behavioral Medicine,"Carroll D., Ring C., Shrimpton J., Evans P., Willemsen G., Hucklebridge F.",1996,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Secure Attachment Partners Attenuate Neural Responses To Social Exclusion: An Fmri Investigation,"Research has shown that social exclusion has devastating psychological, physiological, and behavioral consequences. However, little is known about possible ways to shield individuals from the detrimental effects of social exclusion. The present study, in which participants were excluded during a ball-tossing game, examined whether (reminders of) secure attachment relationships could attenuate neurophysiological pain- and stress-related responses to social exclusion. Social exclusion was associated with activation in brain areas implicated in the regulation and experience of social distress, including areas in the lateral and medial prefrontal cortex, ventral anterior cingulate cortex, and hypothalamus. However, less activation in these areas was found to the extent that participants felt more securely attached to their attachment figure. Moreover, the psychological presence (i.e., salience) of an attachment figure attenuated hypothalamus activation during episodes of social exclusion, thereby providing insight into the neural mechanisms by which attachment relationships may help in coping with social stress. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",doi,10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2011.04.003,Scopus,International Journal of Psychophysiology,"Karremans J.C., Heslenfeld D.J., van Dillen L.F., Van Lange P.A.M.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas

In the present study, a 2 (smoke vs. sham smoke) X 2 (stress vs. no stress) factorial design was used to evaluate the impact of stress and smoking on the cardiovascular responses of young women.

,Serious Games To Teach Social Interactions And Emotions To Individuals With Autism Spectrum Disorders (Asd),"The use of information communication technologies (ICTs) in therapy offers new perspectives for treating many domains in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) because they can be used in many different ways and settings and they are attractive to the patients. We reviewed the available literature on serious games that are used to teach social interactions to individuals with ASD. After screening the Medline, Science Direct and ACM Digital Library databases, we found a total of 31 serious games: 16 that targeted emotion recognition or production and 15 that targeted social skills. There was a significant correlation between the number of reports per year and the year of publication. Serious games appeared promising because they can support training on many different skills and they favour interactions in diverse contexts and situations, some of which may resemble real life. However, the currently available serious games exhibit some limitations: (i) most of them are developed for High-Functioning individuals; (ii) their clinical validation has rarely met the evidence-based medicine standards; (iii) the game design is not usually described; and, (iv) in many cases, the clinical validation and playability/game design are not compatible. Future research agendas should encompass (i) more robust studies in terms of methodology (large samples, control groups, longer treatment periods, follow-up to assess whether changes remain stable, etc.) to assess serious game efficacy; (ii) more collaboration between clinical and computer/game design experts; and (iii) more serious games that are adapted to Low-Functioning ASD individuals. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",doi,10.1016/j.compedu.2017.05.002,Scopus,Computers and Education,"Grossard C., Grynspan O., Serret S., Jouen A.-L., Bailly K., Cohen D.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Set-Up Games: A Heuristic Game-Theoretic Approach To Set-Up Decisions For Hierarchical Manufacturing Systems,"Heterarchical control systems have emerged as promising alternatives to conventional centralized and hierarchical shop floor control systems. However, research to date has largely ignored long-term control issues such as the timing of resource reconfigurations, which are vital for the avoidance of myopic decision-making. As traditional analysis techniques implicitly assume centralized analysis and implementation of policies, they are not directly applicable to heterarchical environments. A non-cooperative game-theoretic planning technique for autonomous analyses of reconfiguration decisions by heterarchical machine controllers is described. Under the proposed system, a machine controller evaluates a set-up game to determine appropriate actions when faced with a sequence-independent reconfiguration decision. The prescribed action is defined by a pure or mixed-strategy equilibrium of the set-up game. By evaluating a game, the machine controller accounts for the potential actions and reactions of other machine controllers in the system.

,Smarter Phones For Healthier Lifestyles: An Adaptive Fitness Game,"Monster & Gold, is a context-aware, user-adaptive fitness game for mobile phones, which acts as persuasive tool and can trigger decision-making of the user. The game trains and motivates users to jog outdoors at the correct intensity. Evaluations of the game have led to improved game design and have confirmed the game's beneficial effects on training and motivation. The tool processes pulse data, provided by a Bluetooth pulse oximeter clipped on the user's ear and determines the user's position and speed through the mobile phone's internal GPS. The game's audio relies on a set of prerecorded spoken words combined in real time to produce sentences. Evaluations of the game showed that the game's motivational effect received a positive average rating and that most users reported that they would jog more often and more willingly if they could always use the game.",doi,10.1109/MPRV.2010.52,Scopus,IEEE Pervasive Computing,"Buttussi F., Chittaro L.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Social Exclusion: More Important To Human Females Than Males,"Theoretical models based on primate evidence suggest that social structure determines the costs and benefits of particular aggressive strategies. In humans, males more than females interact in groups of unrelated same-sex peers, and larger group size predicts success in inter-group contests. In marked contrast, human females form isolated one-on-one relationships with fewer instrumental benefits, so social exclusion constitutes a more useful strategy. If this model is accurate, then human social exclusion should be utilized by females more than males and females should be more sensitive to its occurrence. Here we present four studies supporting this model. In Study 1, using a computerized game with fictitious opponents, we demonstrate that females are more willing than males to socially exclude a temporary ally. In Study 2, females report more actual incidents of social exclusion than males do. In Study 3, females perceive cues revealing social exclusion more rapidly than males do. Finally, in Study 4, females' heart rate increases more than males' in response to social exclusion. Together, results indicate that social exclusion is a strategy well-tailored to human females' social structure. © 2013 Benenson et al.",doi,10.1371/journal.pone.0055851,Scopus,PLoS ONE,"Benenson J.F., Markovits H., Hultgren B., Nguyen T., Bullock G., Wrangham R.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,"Social Influence On Associative Learning: Double Dissociation In High-Functioning Autism, Early-Stage Behavioural Variant Frontotemporal Dementia And Alzheimer's Disease","Introduction: Most of our learning activity takes place in a social context. I examined how social interactions influence associative learning in neurodegenerative diseases and atypical neurodevelopmental conditions primarily characterised by social cognitive and memory dysfunctions. Methods: Participants were individuals with high-functioning autism (HFA, n=18), early-stage behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD, n=16) and Alzheimer's disease (AD, n=20). The leading symptoms in HFA and bvFTD were social and behavioural dysfunctions, whereas AD was characterised by memory deficits. Participants received three versions of a paired associates learning task. In the game with boxes test, objects were hidden in six candy boxes placed in different locations on the computer screen. In the game with faces, each box was labelled by a photo of a person. In the real-life version of the game, participants played with real persons. Results: Individuals with HFA and bvFTD performed well in the computer games, but failed on the task including real persons. In contrast, in patients with early-stage AD, social interactions boosted paired associates learning up to the level of healthy control volunteers. Worse performance in the real life game was associated with less successful recognition of complex emotions and mental states in the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test. Spatial span did not affect the results. Conclusions: When social cognition is impaired, but memory systems are less compromised (HFA and bvFTD), real-life interactions disrupt associative learning; when disease process impairs memory systems but social cognition is relatively intact (early-stage AD), social interactions have a beneficial effect on learning and memory. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.cortex.2014.02.018,Scopus,Cortex,Kéri S.,2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Social Network Sites Influence Recovery From Social Exclusion: Individual Differences In Social Anxiety,"Social network sites (SNSs) have been found to be closely associated with responses to social exclusion and to impact people with high or low levels of social anxiety in different ways. Our study tested whether social anxiety, an individual difference variable, affected the association between SNSs and responses to social exclusion. A Cyberball game was conducted to create social exclusion, followed by a waiting period during which participants were observed to see whether they would choose to use SNSs. Afterwards, recovery from participants' negative responses to exclusion was measured. Results showed that using SNSs benefited the highly socially anxious (HSA) group in terms of recovering from disconnection and feeling a sense of meaningful existence more than the low socially anxious (LSA) group. However, recovery from disconnection was lower for LSA individuals who used SNSs than those who did not use SNSs. Our research suggests that SNSs benefited HSA individuals after social exclusion, but hindered the recovery of LSA individuals. © 2017",doi,10.1016/j.chb.2017.05.044,Scopus,Computers in Human Behavior,"Lin X., Li S., Qu C.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Specific Cue Reactivity On Computer Game-Related Cues In Excessive Gamers,"It has been posited that excessive computer game playing behavior, referred to as computer game addiction, meets criteria that have been internationally established to define drug addiction. Nevertheless, there have been no psychophysiological investigations of the underlying mechanisms available to support the characterization of excessive computer gaming as behavioral addiction. To investigate whether excessive computer gaming parallels learning processes in development and maintenance (which are assumed to underlie drug addiction), the authors obtained a psychophysiological assessment of the (learned) emotional processing of computer game-relevant and -irrelevant cues. For this purpose, electroencephalographic recordings in excessive and casual computer game players were conducted. Significant between-group differences in event-related potentials evoked by computer game related-cues were found at parietal regions and point to an increased emotional processing of these cues in excessive pathological players compared with casual players. These results are in concordance with the suggestion that addiction is characterized and maintained through sensitization of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system along with incentive salience of specific addiction-associated cues. © 2007 American Psychological Association.",doi,10.1037/0735-7044.121.3.614,Scopus,Behavioral Neuroscience,"Thalemann R., Wölfling K., Grüsser S.M.",2007,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Speeding Up Multiagent Reinforcement Learning By Coarse-Graining Of Perception: The Hunter Game,"Reinforcement learning is a promising technique for making agents learn to cooperate in the real world. When we try to apply the technique to a practical problem, however, the slowness of learning due to the increased number of states becomes a bottleneck. We try to speed up learning by reducing the effective number of states by coarse-graining of perceptions at the early stage of learning, and at the same time try to ensure the overall performance by switching back to complete perception later. By only switching the perception granularity, however, it is difficult to rectify bad habits acquired at the early stage of learning. Hence, we make a coarse-grained perception learner and a complete perception learner work in parallel, and switch the learner used for action selection at appropriate time. This technique makes possible both fast early-stage learning and overall good performance.",doi,10.1002/ecjb.1078,Scopus,"Electronics and Communications in Japan, Part II: Electronics (English translation of Denshi Tsushin Gakkai Ronbunshi)","Ito A., Kanabuchi M.",2001,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Stimulus Specificity But No Dishabituation Of Sensory-Specific Satiety,"Sensory-specific satiety (SSS) refers to the decrease of pleasure derived from a food with its consumption. In the current study it was examined whether SSS for a specific food can be dishabituated. To this end a total of 40 participants (10 males) received bite sized portions of a test food to repeatedly consume. This typically renders SSS for that food. After such established SSS, the participants ate a different test food repeatedly during a period of 10. min or played a computer game (i.e., Tetris), depending on the experimental condition. It was expected that the consumption of another food would induce dishabituation of SSS for the original test food. The participants indeed demonstrated SSS to the test food, but irrespective of condition this SSS proved stable. It is concluded that SSS is stimulus (i.e., food) specific but not subject to dishabituation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.appet.2012.02.009,Scopus,Appetite,Havermans R.C.,2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Stochastic Payoff Evaluation Increases The Temperature Of Selection,"We study stochastic evolutionary game dynamics in populations of finite size. Moreover, each individual has a randomly distributed number of interactions with other individuals. Therefore, the payoff of two individuals using the same strategy can be different. The resulting ""payoff stochasticity"" reduces the intensity of selection and therefore increases the temperature of selection. A simple mean-field approximation is derived that captures the average effect of the payoff stochasticity. Correction terms to the mean-field theory are computed and discussed. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

,Supporting Motion Capture Acting Through A Mixed Reality Application,"Current and future animations seek for more human-like motions to create believable animations for computer games, animated movies and commercial spots. A technology widely used technology is motion capture to capture actors' movements which enrich digital avatars motions and emotions. However, a motion capture environment poses challenges to actors such as short preparation times and the need to highly rely on their acting and imagination skills. To support these actors, we developed a mixed reality application that allows showing digital environments while performing and being able to see the real and virtual world. We tested our prototype with 6 traditionally trained theatre and TV actors. As a result, the actors indicated that our application supported them getting into the demanded acting moods with less unrequired emotions. The acting scenario was also better understood with less need of explanation than when just discussing the scenario, as commonly done in theatre acting. © 2018, IGI Global.

,Sympathetic Indices During Psychological And Physical Stimuli Before And After Training,"The effects of psychological and physical stimuli on cardiovascular and catecholamine changes were studied before and after physical training. These functions were investigated in eight labile hypertensive men in response to the mild psychological stimulus of playing a video game and the mild physical stimuli of sitting and standing. The results show that plasma norepinephrine concentration rises with sitting and standing but plasma epinephrine concentration increases only with the psychological stimulus. Physical training was associated with smaller increases in blood pressure during psychological and physical stimuli and with a lower heart rate at rest. On the other hand, plasma catecholamines at rest as well as in response to the different stimuli were unchanged following moderate training. These observations suggest that the adrenal medulla is selectively activated during a period of mild psychological stress, while the activity of the sympathetic fibers is preferentially increased during mild physical stimuli. Furthermore, the results of this study show that plasma catecholamine levels at rest and their increase during various stimuli are unchanged following training. © 1985.",doi,10.1016/0031-9384(85)90349-X,Scopus,Physiology and Behavior,"Cleroux J., Peronnet F., de Champlain J.",1985,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas

,Tactile Defensiveness In Children With Developmental Disabilities: Responsiveness And Habituation,"Tactile defensiveness (TD) is characterized by behaviors such as rubbing, scratching, negative expressions, withdrawal, or avoidance in response to tactile stimulation. An inhibition deficit has been implied in the literature and is the focus of this study. School-aged children with developmental disabilities were first assessed for level of TD using three measures. Later, the children were presented with a repeated tactile stimulus while engaged in a computer game. Intensity, duration, and latency of the responses were recorded on each trial. It was hypothesized that higher levels of TD would be associated with (a) greater responsiveness and (b) slower habituation rates to the tactile stimulus. Correlations of three separate TD measures and a series of 3×10 (Level of TD by Responsiveness across trials) repeated measures ANOVAs were used to test the two hypotheses. Children who demonstrated higher levels of TD on some of the preliminary measures also showed higher responsiveness in the experimental situation. There was no general habituation effect, and the limited group by trials interactions were not interpretable. We concluded that there is evidence for a differential sensitivity in TD, but not an inhibition deficit. Another significant finding included a negative correlation between TD and developmental age. © 1994 Plenum Publishing Corporation.",doi,10.1007/BF02172128,Scopus,Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders,"Baranek G.T., Berkson G.",1994,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Teaming Up Humans With Autonomous Synthetic Characters,"Autonomous synthetic characters have the potential to promote the social engagement of users in virtual environments, enhancing their interaction experience. In computer games, for example, poor interaction with game characters can drastically detract from the gaming experience, making the design of autonomous synthetic characters an important issue. In particular, in Role Playing Games (RPGs), for example, users and autonomous characters often perform in a group. Usually, the role of such characters is very limited since they lack the social skills to perform coherently in group scenarios. The goal of the work presented here is to endow autonomous synthetic characters with social skills that allow them to perform in groups with human members. However, to successfully achieve this, it is not enough to assure that the characters behave in a coherent manner from an individual perspective or that they are able to perform the group task optimally. It is also necessary that the autonomous characters exhibit behaviours that are coherent with the group's composition, context and structure. For this reason, we have developed a model to support group dynamics of autonomous synthetic characters (SGD model) inspired by theories developed in human social psychological sciences. This model defines the knowledge that each individual should build about the others and the group, and how this knowledge drives their interactions. The model was used in a collaborative computer game that was tested with users. The results showed that the model had a positive effect on the users' social engagement, namely, on their trust and identification with the group. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

,Tell Me A Story,"For the past few years, the storytelling research domain has raised the interest of several researchers from different areas (such as interactive drama, computer games, intelligent learning environment etc.), mainly because stories are an important vehicle to structure the human knowledge and past experience, and even to help people to behave in a social context. In this paper, we present a storytelling approach, which is based on the premise that story and narrative may emerge from characters' interactions during the creation activity, but such characters may either act autonomously or be controlled by children. Since we position our research in an educational context, we argue that in such creation activities children's thoughts and needs must be respected and contribute directly to the achievement of the story. Therefore, children should be provided with some support and guidance directives to help them to better understand and reflect on the role-taking situations they experience during such activity. To prove the validity of our approach we developed a generic architecture - Support And Guidance Architecture (SAGA). SAGA aims not only to provide support and guidance to children during the story telling activities, by combining the roles of a dynamic script writer and a drama manager, but also to provide such services to already existing story creation applications. To illustrate this, we have integrated SAGA with Teatrix, a collaborative virtual environment for story creation, and an evaluation study was conducted in order to find the impact of SAGA in children's storytelling activities. © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2005.",doi,10.1007/s10055-005-0002-6,Scopus,Virtual Reality,"Machado I., Brna P., Paiva A.",2005,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas

The activity intensities reached when playing active tennis gaming relative to sedentary gaming, tennis game-play, and current activity recommendations in young adults. J Strength Cond Res 27(9): 2588-2595, 2013- Although active gaming is popular and can increase energy expenditure in young adults, its efficacy as a prescriptive exercise tool is not well understood. This study aimed to: (a) compare the activity intensities experienced by young adults while playing active tennis gaming with conventional sedentary gaming, tennis game-play, and current activity recommendations for health; and (b) identify changes in activity intensities across playing time. After habitualization, 10 active young adults (age: 20.2 ± 0.4 years; stature: 1.74 ± 0.03 m; body mass: 67.7 ± 3.3 kg) completed 3 experimental trials (sedentary gaming, active tennis gaming, and tennis game-play) on separate days in a randomized order. Heart rate (HR) and metabolic equivalents (METs) were averaged across 5 minutes and 10 minutes intervals, and the entire 20 minutes bout within each condition. Active gaming produced greater intensities across 5-10, 10-15, and 15-20 minutes time intervals compared with sedentary gaming (p &lt; 0.01). Tennis game-play elicited greater HR (67 ± 5% HRmax) and METs (5.0 ± 0.2) responses than both sedentary (40 ± 2% HRmax, 1.1 ± 0.1 METs) and active gaming (45 ± 2% HRmax, 1.4 ± 0.1 METs) (p &lt; 0.001). Only tennis game-play produced activity intensities meeting current recommendations for health benefit. Lower HR intensities were reached across 0-5 minutes than during later time intervals during active gaming (6%) and tennis game-play (9%) (p &lt; 0.01). Activity intensities elicited by active gaming were greater than sedentary gaming but less than tennis game-play and insufficient to contribute toward promoting and maintaining good health in young adults. These data suggest that active tennis gaming should not be recommended by exercise professionals as a substitute for actual sports participation in young adults. © 2013 National Strength and Conditioning Association.",doi,10.1519/JSC.0b013e31827f523e,Scopus,Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research,"Scanlan A.T., Arkinstall H., Dalbo V.J., Humphries B.J., Jennings C.T., Kingsley M.I.C.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,The Association Between Exercise Behavior Regulation And Exergaming In Adolescents,"Background: It is not known if or how exercise behavior regulations (EBRs) relate to exergaming in adolescents. The study objectives were 1) to determine if EBRs differ between adolescents who do and do not exergame; and 2) among exergamers, to describe the associations between EBRs and exergame duration, intensity, and achieving physical activity (PA) guidelines. Methods: This study was a cross-sectional analysis of data collected in mailed self-report questionnaires completed by 1243 students (mean ± SD<inf>age</inf> = 16.8 ± 0.5 years; 43% boys). Results: In girls, those who exergamed scored higher than nonexergamers on introjected (mean ± SD = 1.9 ± 1.0 vs.1.6 ± 0.9; P = .001) and identified (mean ± SD = 3.1 ± .0 vs.2.9 ± 0.9; P = .049) regulation. Exergame intensity was associated with identified regulation [OR (95% CI) = 2.2 (1.0, 4.5)], minutes exergaming per week was associated with amotivation [β (95% CI) = 0.4 (-0.0, 0.8)], and achieving guidelines was associated with external [OR (95% CI) = 3.7 (1.0, 13.4)] and identified [OR (95% CI) = 5.6 (2.0, 16.0)] regulations. In boys who exergamed, intrinsic regulation was associated with exergame duration [β (95% CI) = -0.3 (-0.6, 0.0)]. Conclusions: Girls who exergame may have partially internalized exergaming as a PA behavior. Boys may prefer other types of PA such as team sports or other more traditional videogames over exergaming or they may not view exergaming as PA. © 2015 Human Kinetics, Inc.",doi,10.1123/jpah.2012-0455,Scopus,Journal of Physical Activity and Health,"O'Loughlin E.K., Sabiston C.M., Dugas E.N., O'Loughlin J.L.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas

,The Design Of An Intelligent Soccer-Playing Robot,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to design intelligent robots operating in such dynamic environments like the RoboCup Middle-Size League (MSL). In the RoboCup MSL, two teams of five autonomous robots play on an 18-X 12-m field. Equipped with sensors and on-board computers, each robot should be able to perceive the environment, make decision and control itself to play the soccer game autonomously. Design/methodology/approach: This paper presents the design of our soccer robots, participating in RoboCup MSL. The mechanical platform, electrical architecture and software framework are discussed separately. The mechanical platform is designed modularly, so easy maintainability is achieved; the electronic architecture is built on industrial standards using PC-based control technique, which results in high robustness and reliability during the intensive and fierce MSL games; the software is developed upon the open-source Robot Operating System (ROS); thus, the advantages of ROS such as modularity, portability and expansibility are inherited. Findings: Based on this paper and the open-source hardware and software, the MSL robots can be re-developed easily to participate in the RoboCup MSL. The robots can also be used in other research and education fields, especially for multi-robot systems and distributed artificial intelligence. Furthermore, the main designing ideas proposed in the paper, i.e. using a modular mechanical structure, an industrial electronic system and ROS-based software, provide a common solution for designing general intelligent robots.

,The Effect Of Laboratory Stressors On Glycemic Control And Gastrointestinal Transit Time,"This study compared effects of an active coping task (computerized stressors involving arithmetic, anagrams, and Atari games) and a passive coping task (cold pressor) on gastrointestinal transit time and glycemic response to an oral glucose load. Eleven normal weight males were studied; subjects participated in three counterbalanced sessions, each including a 45-minute baseline, 20-minute experimental period (active coping, passive coping, or nonstress control) and 2.5-hour recovery period. The stressors produced different cardiovascular and catecholamine responses; systolic and diastolic blood pressure were highest during cold pressor (p < 0.001), heart rate was highest during computer stressor (p < 0.001), and norepinephrine excretion was greatest during cold pressor (p < 0.002). However, both stressors delayed gastrointestinal transit time compared with the control condition (p < 0.009 and p < 0.026 for cold pressor and computerized stressor, respectively) and both delayed the time of peak glucose response (p < 0.002 and p < 0.05, respectively).

,The Effects Of Acute Doses Of Nicotine On Video Lottery Terminal Gambling In Daily Smokers,"Rationale A growing body of evidence suggests that gambling frequently co-occurs with smoking, yet little is known about the degree to which nicotine and/or tobacco use influences gambling behavior. Nonetheless, an increasing number of studies suggest that acute administration of nicotine may alter other reinforcing behaviors in both animal and human models, raising the possibility that nicotine may also influence gambling behavior and craving. Objectives The purpose of this study was to examine the acute effects of nicotine on subjective and behavioral gambling responses. Methods Twenty-eight (15 male) regular gamblers who smoke daily completed two double-blind laboratory sessions where their subjective and behavioral responses to video lottery terminal (VLT) gambling were assessed, following the administration of nicotine inhalers (NI; 4 mg deliverable) or placebo inhalers. Results NI significantly decreased tobacco-related cravings (p<0.05) but did not affect gambling-related cravings, VLT betting patterns, or subjective responses (ps>0.1). Conclusions NI were found to acutely suppress tobacco-related cravings without influencing gambling. These results suggest that use of nicotine replacement therapies may be a safe option for gamblers who are attempting to quit smoking. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",doi,10.1007/s00213-011-2465-3,Scopus,Psychopharmacology,"McGrath D.S., Barrett S.P., Stewart S.H., Schmid E.A.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,The Effects Of An Action Video Game On Visual And Affective Information Processing,"Playing action video games can have beneficial effects on visuospatial cognition and negative effects on social information processing. However, these two effects have not been demonstrated in the same individuals in a single study. The current study used event-related brain potentials (ERPs) to examine the effects of playing an action or non-action video game on the processing of emotion in facial expression. The data revealed that 10 h of playing an action or non-action video game had differential effects on the ERPs relative to a no-contact control group. Playing an action game resulted in two effects: one that reflected an increase in the amplitude of the ERPs following training over the right frontal and posterior regions that was similar for angry, happy, and neutral faces; and one that reflected a reduction in the allocation of attention to happy faces. In contrast, playing a non-action game resulted in changes in slow wave activity over the central-parietal and frontal regions that were greater for targets (i.e., angry and happy faces) than for non-targets (i.e., neutral faces). These data demonstrate that the contrasting effects of action video games on visuospatial and emotion processing occur in the same individuals following the same level of gaming experience. This observation leads to the suggestion that caution should be exercised when using action video games to modify visual processing, as this experience could also have unintended effects on emotion processing. © 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.",doi,10.1016/j.brainres.2013.02.019,Scopus,Brain Research,"Bailey K., West R.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,The Effects Of Coping Style On Virtual Reality Enhanced Videogame Distraction In Children Undergoing Cold Pressor Pain,"This study sought to evaluate the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR) enhanced interactive videogame distraction for children undergoing experimentally induced cold pressor pain and examined the role of avoidant and approach coping style as a moderator of VR distraction effectiveness. Sixty-two children (6-13 years old) underwent a baseline cold pressor trial followed by two cold pressor trials in which interactive videogame distraction was delivered both with and without a VR helmet in counterbalanced order. As predicted, children demonstrated significant improvement in pain tolerance during both interactive videogame distraction conditions. However, a differential response to videogame distraction with or without the enhancement of VR technology was not found. Children's coping style did not moderate their response to distraction. Rather, interactive videogame distraction with and without VR technology was equally effective for children who utilized avoidant or approach coping styles. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",doi,10.1007/s10865-012-9479-0,Scopus,Journal of Behavioral Medicine,"Sil S., Dahlquist L.M., Thompson C., Hahn A., Herbert L., Wohlheiter K., Horn S.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,"The Effects Of Prosocial Video Games On Prosocial Behaviors: International Evidence From Correlational, Experimental, And Longitudinal Studies.","Although dozens of studies have documented a relationship between violent video games and aggressive behaviors, very little attention has been paid to potential effects of prosocial games. Theoretically, games in which game characters help and support each other in nonviolent ways should increase both short-term and long-term prosocial behaviors. We report three studies conducted in three countries with three age groups to test this hypothesis. In the correlational study, Singaporean middle-school students who played more prosocial games behaved more prosocially. In the two longitudinal samples of Japanese children and adolescents, prosocial game play predicted later increases in prosocial behavior. In the experimental study, U.S. undergraduates randomly assigned to play prosocial games behaved more prosocially toward another student. These similar results across different methodologies, ages, and cultures provide robust evidence of a prosocial game content effect, and they provide support for the General Learning Model.",doi,10.1177/0146167209333045,anderson2010,Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin,"Gentile, D.

,The Expression Of Victory And Loss: Estimating Who's Leading Or Trailing From Nonverbal Cues In Sports,"The goal of the paper was to test if humans can detect whether athletes are trailing or leading in sports based on the perception of thin slices of athletes' nonverbal behavior. In Experiment 1, participants who were unexperienced in the respective sports watched short videos depicting basketball and table tennis players and rated whether athletes were trailing or leading. Results indicated that participants could significantly differentiate between trailing and leading athletes in both team and individual sports. Experiment 2 showed that children were also able to distinguish between trailing and leading athletes based on nonverbal behavior. Comparison with the adult results from Experiment 1 revealed that the adult ratings corresponded to a higher degree with the actual scores during the game compared to the children's. In Experiment 3, we replicated the findings from Experiment 1 with both expert and unexperienced participants and a different set of stimuli from team handball. Both experts and unexpert participants were able to differentiate between leading and trailing athletes. Our findings are in line with evolutionary accounts of nonverbal behavior and suggest that humans display nonverbal signals as a consequence of leading or trailing which are reliably interpreted by others. By comparing this effect as a function of different age groups we provide evidence that although even young children can differentiate between leading and trailing athletes, the decoding of subtle nonverbal cues continues to develop with increasing experience and maturation processes. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",doi,10.1007/s10919-013-0168-7,Scopus,Journal of Nonverbal Behavior,"Furley P., Schweizer G.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,The Finite Element Implementation Of A K.p.p. Equation For The Simulation Of Tsetse Control Measures In The Vicinity Of A Game Reserve,"An equation, strongly reminiscent of Fisher's equation, is used to model the response of tsetse populations to proposed control measures in the vicinity of a game reserve. The model assumes movement is by diffusion and that growth is logistic. This logistic growth is dependent on an historical population, in contrast to Fisher's equation which bases it on the present population. The model therefore takes into account the fact that new additions to the adult fly population are, in actual fact, the descendents of a population which existed one puparial duration ago, furthermore, that this puparial duration is temperature dependent. Artificially imposed mortality is modelled as a proportion at a constant rate. Fisher's equation is also solved as a formality.The temporary imposition of a 2% day-1 mortality everywhere outside the reserve for a period of 2years will have no lasting effect on the influence of the reserve on either the Glossina austeni or the G. brevipalpis populations, although it certainly will eradicate tsetse from poor habitat, outside the reserve. A 5km-wide barrier with a minimum mortality of 4% day-1, throughout, will succeed in isolating a worst-case, G. austeni population and its associated trypanosomiasis from the surrounding areas. A more optimistic estimate of its mobility suggests a mortality of 2% day-1 will suffice. For a given target-related mortality, more mobile species are found to be more vulnerable to eradication than more sedentary species, while the opposite is true for containment. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.",doi,10.1016/j.mbs.2010.05.007,Scopus,Mathematical Biosciences,Childs S.J.,2010,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,The Impact Of Sexual Arousal On Sexual Risk-Taking And Decision-Making In Men And Women,"Sexual arousal has emerged as an important contextual feature in sexual encounters that can impact safer-sex decision-making. We conducted two experiments that investigated the effects of sexual arousal among male and female participants. Experiment 1 (N = 144) examined the impact of sexual around on sexual health decision-making. Sexually explicit and neutral video clips as well as hypothetical romantic scenarios were used to evaluate the effects of sexual arousal on sexual risk-taking intentions. Men and women who reported higher levels of sexual arousal also displayed greater intentions to participate in risky sexual behavior (e.g., unprotected sex with a new sex partner). Experiment 2 (N = 122) examined the impact of sexual arousal on general risk-taking, using the same videos clips as in Experiment 1 and a modified version of a computerized Blackjack card game. Participants were offered a chance to make either a risky play or a safe play during ambiguous conditions. Increased sexual arousal in Experiment 2 was associated with impulsivity and a greater willingness to make risky plays in the Blackjack game. These findings suggest that, in situations where there are strong sexually visceral cues, both men and women experiencing strong sexual arousal may have lower inhibitions and may experience impaired decision-making. This phenomenon may have an impact during sexual encounters and may contribute to a failure to use appropriate prophylactic protection. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",doi,10.1007/s10508-015-0589-y,Scopus,Archives of Sexual Behavior,"Skakoon-Sparling S., Cramer K.M., Shuper P.A.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,The Impact Of Social Stress On Self-Esteem And Paranoid Ideation,"Background: Vulnerability-stress models propose that social stress triggers psychotic episodes in high risk individuals. Previous studies found not only stress but also a decrease in self-esteem to precede the formation of delusions. As evidence for causal conclusions has not been provided yet, the present study assessed the direct impact of social stress on paranoid beliefs using an experimental design and considered a decrease in self-esteem as a mediator and the proneness to psychosis and paranoia as moderators of the effect. Methods: A nonclinical population sample (n = 76) was randomly assigned to an experimental (EG) or a control group condition (CG). In the EG, participants were excluded during a virtual ball game (Cyberball) by the other two players and received a negative feedback after performing a test. The CG was included in the game and received a neutral feedback. Before and after the experimental conditions, emotions, self-esteem and paranoid beliefs were assessed using state-adapted questionnaires. Results: After the social stress induction, the EG reported a higher increase in subclinical paranoid beliefs compared to the CG. The impact of social stress on paranoid ideation was mediated by a decrease in self-esteem and moderated by proneness to paranoia. Individuals who felt distressed by paranoid thoughts at baseline were more likely to react with an increase in paranoid ideation under social stress. Limitations: The results need to be confirmed in a patient sample to draw conclusions about the processes involved in the formation of delusions in clinically relevant stages. Conclusions: The impact of social stress on symptom formation and self-esteem is discussed in terms of recent models of symptom formation and interventions in psychosis. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

,The Impact Of Sound In Modern Multiline Video Slot Machine Play,"Slot machine wins and losses have distinctive, measurable, physiological effects on players. The contributing factors to these effects remain under-explored. We believe that sound is one of these key contributing factors. Sound plays an important role in reinforcement, and thus on arousal level and stress response of players. It is the use of sound for positive reinforcement in particular that we believe influences the player. In the current study, we investigate the role that sound plays in psychophysical responses to slot machine play. A total of 96 gamblers played a slot machine simulator with and without sound being paired with reinforcement. Skin conductance responses and heart rate, as well as subjective judgments about the gambling experience were examined. The results showed that the sound influenced the arousal of participants both psychophysically and psychologically. The sound also influenced players' preferences, with the majority of players preferring to play slot machines that were accompanied by winning sounds. The sounds also caused players to significantly overestimate the number of times they won while playing the slot machine.",doi,10.1007/s10899-013-9391-8,Scopus,Journal of gambling studies / co-sponsored by the National Council on Problem Gambling and Institute for the Study of Gambling and Commercial Gaming,"Dixon M.J., Harrigan K.A., Santesso D.L., Graydon C., Fugelsang J.A., Collins K.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,The Influence Of Game Duration And Playing Position On Intensity Of Exercise During Match-Play In Elite Water Polo Players,"In this study, we assessed exercise intensity in 20 water polo games of different duration. The hypothesis that right wing players perform at a higher intensity than back and forward central players was also tested. Thirty water polo players, equally split between three field positions, participated in the study. Initially, their performance-related physiological capabilities were evaluated. Subsequently, during water polo games of short (4 × 7-min periods) or long duration (4 × 9-min periods), heart rate was monitored continuously and blood lactate concentration was measured at the end of each period. Activity patterns were also recorded using a video camera. Mean heart rate over the entire game was 156 ± 18 beats · min-1. Overall exercise intensity fluctuated around a value corresponding to the lactate threshold (4.03 ± 0.96 mmol · -186 ± 5% of peak heart rate) and decreased (P &lt; 0.003) with game time (4.22 ± 1.8 and 3.47 ± 1.9 mmol · l-1 in the second and fourth quarter, respectively). During the last 6 min, heart rate was higher (P &lt; 0.001) in games of short duration (156 ± 3 beats · min-1) than in games of long duration (152 ± 8 beats · min-1). Video analysis showed that the percentage of time spent in low-intensity activities (i.e. ""out of game"") was lower (23 vs. 26%), whereas that in high-intensity activities (i.e. ""sprinting crawl"") was higher (21 vs. 19%), in games of short compared with long duration. No difference was observed among players of various field positions in any of the variables examined. Thus during match-play, games of long duration produced significantly lower heart rate responses than games of short duration, and the physiological response exhibited by the players was not affected by field position. The water polo authorities should consider these results before changing game duration and coaches should prepare their athletes accordingly.",doi,10.1080/02640410500457794,Scopus,Journal of Sports Sciences,"Platanou T., Geladas N.",2006,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,The Influence Of The Playing Surface On The Exercise Intensity Of Small-Sided Recreational Soccer Games,"This study aimed to analyze the influence of the playing surface on movement pattern, physical loading, perceived exertion, and fatigue development during small-sided recreational soccer games. Time-motion, heart rate, blood lactate, and perceived exertion were measured for 16 recreational players aged 22 (range: 19-35)yrs. During 5-a-side soccer games on 3 different field surfaces: sand, artificial turf, and asphalt. Jump and sprint tests were performed prior to and after each game. Total distance covered was higher on asphalt and turf than on sand (3.89±0.04 and 3.73±0.12 vs. 2.59±0.21km; p&lt;01), and the number of high-intensity runs was higher on asphalt than on turf (55±3 vs. 43±3; p&lt;.05), but not sand (46±6). Mean heart rate (means±SEM, 160±3 vs. 171±1 b.p.m.) and time&gt;90% HRmax (20.8±5.1% vs. 44.1±5.0%) were lower (p&lt;.05) on asphalt than on turf, with intermediate values for sand. Blood lactate was lower on asphalt than on sand (2.8±0.3 vs. 4.7±0.6mmolL-1; p&lt;.05). Perceived exertion was lower on asphalt than on turf and sand (VAS 0-100: 52±3 vs. 72±3 and 72±3; p&lt;.01). After the game, squat and countermovement jump performances were lower (4.9-8.1%, and 1.9-6.4%, respectively; p&lt;.001) for all field surfaces, but no changes were observed in 5- and 30-m sprint performance. Small-sided recreational soccer games elicit high heart rates, multiple intense actions, and decreased jump performance for all the investigated playing surfaces, suggesting that multiple fitness and health benefits can be achieved through soccer on sand, artificial turf and asphalt. Nonetheless, locomotor activities, heart rate, blood lactate levels, and perceived exertion differ between surfaces. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",doi,10.1016/j.humov.2011.08.011,Scopus,Human Movement Science,"Brito J., Krustrup P., Rebelo A.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,"The Motivational Pull Of Video Game Feedback, Rules, And Social Interaction: Another Self-Determination Theory Approach","This paper argues that most video game enjoyment can be understood in terms of the type of feedback used, the rules set out by the game and the social elements of the game - concepts that have been identified as critical to video games. Self-determination theory (SDT) is used as a lens for understanding the mechanism by which these traits might lead to enjoyment. Specifically, the argument is that feedback, rules, and social elements of games will fulfill the dimensions of SDT - competence autonomy, and relatedness. Then, the dimensions of SDT will predict enjoyment. Participants were presented with a game that emphasized feedback, rules, or social elements. Games that emphasized flexible rules led to feelings of competence while games that emphasized social elements led to feelings of relatedness. Competence and elatedness then led to feelings of enjoyment. In doing so, this study identifies key elements of video games while illuminating ways to understand video game enjoyment. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",doi,10.1016/j.chb.2017.03.048,Scopus,Computers in Human Behavior,Rogers R.,2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,The Neural Correlates Of The Affective Response To Unreciprocated Cooperation,"Humans excel at reciprocal altruism in which two individuals exchange altruistic acts to their mutual advantage. The evolutionary stability of this system depends on recognition of and discrimination against non-reciprocators, and the human mind is apparently specialized for detecting non-reciprocators. Here we investigate the neural response to non-reciprocation of cooperation by imaging human subjects with fMRI as they play an iterated Prisoner's dilemma game with two assumed human partners. Unreciprocated cooperation was associated with greater activity in bilateral anterior insula, left hippocampus and left lingual gyrus, compared with reciprocated cooperation. These areas were also more responsive to unreciprocated cooperation than to unsuccessful risk taking in a non-social context. Finally, functional connectivity between anterior insula and lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in response to unreciprocated cooperation predicted subsequent defection. The anterior insula is involved in awareness of visceral, autonomic feedback from the body and, in concert with the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, may be responsible for negative feeling states that bias subsequent social decision making against cooperation with a non-reciprocating partner. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

,The Perception And Identification Of Facial Emotions In Individuals With Autism Spectrum Disorders Using The Let's Face It! Emotion Skills Battery,"Background: Although impaired social-emotional ability is a hallmark of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the perceptual skills and mediating strategies contributing to the social deficits of autism are not well understood. A perceptual skill that is fundamental to effective social communication is the ability to accurately perceive and interpret facial emotions. To evaluate the expression processing of participants with ASD, we designed the Let's Face It! Emotion Skills Battery (LFI! Battery), a computer-based assessment composed of three subscales measuring verbal and perceptual skills implicated in the recognition of facial emotions. Methods: We administered the LFI! Battery to groups of participants with ASD and typically developing control (TDC) participants that were matched for age and IQ. Results: On the Name Game labeling task, participants with ASD (N = 68) performed on par with TDC individuals (N = 66) in their ability to name the facial emotions of happy, sad, disgust and surprise and were only impaired in their ability to identify the angry expression. On the Matchmaker Expression task that measures the recognition of facial emotions across different facial identities, the ASD participants (N = 66) performed reliably worse than TDC participants (N = 67) on the emotions of happy, sad, disgust, frighten and angry. In the Parts-Wholes test of perceptual strategies of expression, the TDC participants (N = 67) displayed more holistic encoding for the eyes than the mouths in expressive faces whereas ASD participants (N = 66) exhibited the reverse pattern of holistic recognition for the mouth and analytic recognition of the eyes. Conclusion: In summary, findings from the LFI! Battery show that participants with ASD were able to label the basic facial emotions (with the exception of angry expression) on par with age- and IQ-matched TDC participants. However, participants with ASD were impaired in their ability to generalize facial emotions across different identities and showed a tendency to recognize the mouth feature holistically and the eyes as isolated parts. © 2012 The Authors.

,The Physiological Load Imposed On Basketball Players During Competition,"In this study, the intensities of activity and movement patterns during men’s basketball were investigated by videoing the movements and monitoring the heart rate and blood lactate responses of eight elite players during competition. The results are expressed according to ‘live time’, which is actual playing time, and ‘total time’, which includes live time as well as all stoppages in play. The mean (± s.d.) frequency of all activities was 997 ± 183, with a change in movement category every 2.0 s. A mean total of 105 ± 52 high-intensity runs (mean duration 1.7 s) was recorded for each game, resulting in one high-intensity run every 21 s during live time. Sixty percent of live time was spent engaged in low-intensity activity, while 15% was spent in high-intensity activity. The mean heart rate (HR) during live time was 169 ± 9 beats min-1 (89 ± 2% peak HR attained during laboratory testing); 75% of live time was spent with a HR response of greater than 85% peak HR. The mean blood lactate concentration was 6.8 ± 2.8 mM, indicating the involvement of glycolysis in the energy demands of basketball. It is concluded that the physiological requirements of men’s basketball are high, placing considerable demands on the cardiovascular and metabolic capacities of players. © 1995, E. &amp; F.N.

,The Play's The Thing: A Clinical-Developmental Perspective On Video Games,"Electronic play has the potential to contribute positively to children's socioemotional development by facilitating children's making sense of the world around them, developing and refining their abilities to distinguish between fantasy and reality, considering and experimenting with aggression through a safe environment, improving their self-regulation of arousal, and negotiating societal roles and rules. Electronic play also has the potential to benefit children and adolescents in clinical settings, including psychotherapy, treatment of impulsivity and attention deficit disorders, and pain management during medical procedures. As we further our understanding of the role of electronic play in children's lives, we can incorporate this knowledge into our clinical work to expand our application of effective tools and methods with children and adolescents. Further research is needed in this area. Future studies should use clearly and carefully operationalized definitions of variables and constructs, focus on subsets of the population that may be at particular risk, incorporate a developmental perspective, and address issues that relate to culture and socioeconomic status. Future studies also should consider the possible benefits of electronic play in the everyday lives of children and adolescents and in clinical settings. Because our understanding of the role of electronic play in clinical settings is currently limited, clinicians should use particular care in developing a treatment that appropriately matches the relevant characteristics of the games and the play experience with a child or adolescent's particular issues, needs, or condition. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

,The Psychophysiology Of Digital Gaming: The Effect Of A Non Co-Located Opponent,"This article examines the effects of a non co-located opponent on self-reported emotions, psychophysiological responses, and presence experiences during digital game playing. In a within-subjects design, participants played Super Monkey Ball Jr. and Duke Nukem Advance against a computer, a non co-located friend, and a non co-located stranger. In addition to self-report ratings, electromyographic (EMG) activity over zygomaticus major, corrugator supercilii, and orbicularis oculi; cardiac interbeat intervals; and skin conductance level were measured to index positive activation, negative activation, and physiological arousal. When compared to playing against a computer, playing against a human elicited more positive emotional responses and higher arousal, spatial presence, and engagement. In addition, playing against a friend elicited more positive emotional responses (as indexed by facial EMG) and higher self-reported arousal and engagement compared to playing against a stranger. The influence of opponent type on facial EMG responses was dependent on dispositional behavioral activation system (BAS) and behavioral inhibition system (BIS) sensitivities of the player. Orbicularis oculi EMG responses to game violence varied also as a function of the player's impulsivity. These data show that the mere knowledge of who is controlling the opponent character strongly influences emotional and other responses to digital games. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",doi,10.1080/15213260903052240,Scopus,Media Psychology,Ravaja N.,2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,The Role Of Reciprocity In Verbally Persuasive Robots,"The current research examines the persuasive effects of reciprocity in the context of human-robot interaction. This is an important theoretical and practical extension of persuasive robotics by testing (1) if robots can utilize verbal requests and (2) if robots can utilize persuasive mechanisms (e.g., reciprocity) to gain human compliance. Participants played a trivia game with a robot teammate. The ostensibly autonomous robot helped (or failed to help) the participants by providing the correct (vs. incorrect) trivia answers. Then, the robot directly asked participants to complete a 15-minute task for pattern recognition. Compared to no help, results showed that a robot's prior helping behavior significantly increased the likelihood of compliance (60 percent vs. 33 percent). Interestingly, participants' evaluations toward the robot (i.e., competence, warmth, and trustworthiness) did not predict compliance. These results also provided an insightful comparison showing that participants complied at similar rates with the robot and with computer agents. This result documents a clear empirically powerful potential for the role of verbal messages in persuasive robotics.

,The Roles Of Dopamine And Hypocretin In Reward: A Electroencephalographic Study,"The proper functioning of the mesolimbic reward system is largely dependent on the neurotransmitter dopamine. Recent evidence suggests that the hypocretin system has significant projections to this reward system. We examined the distinct effects of reduced dopamine or reduced hypocretin levels on reward activity in patients with Parkinson's disease, dopamine deficient, as well as patients with narcolepsy-cataplexy, hypocretin depleted, and healthy controls. Participants performed a simple game-like task while high-density electroencephalography was recorded. Topography and timing of event-related potentials for both reward cue, and reward feedback was examined across the entire dataset. While response to reward cue was similar in all groups, two distinct time points were found to distinguish patients and controls for reward feedback. Around 160ms both patient groups had reduced ERP amplitude compared to controls. Later at 250ms, both patient groups also showed a clear event-related potential (ERP), which was absent in controls. The initial differences show that both patient groups show a similar, blunted response to reward delivery. The second potential corresponds to the classic feedback-related negativity (FRN) potential which relies on dopamine activity and reflects reward prediction-error signaling. In particular the mismatch between predicted reward and reward subsequently received was significantly higher in PD compared to NC, independent of reward magnitude and valence. The intermediate FRN response in NC highlights the contribution of hypocretin in reward processing, yet also shows that this is not as detrimental to the reward system as in Parkinson's. Furthermore, the inability to generate accurate predictions in NC may explain why hypocretin deficiency mediates cataplexy triggered by both positive and negative emotions. © 2015 Mensen et al.

,"The Thrill Is Gone, But You Might Not Know: Habituation And Generalization Of Biophysiological And Self-Reported Arousal Responses To Video Games","Past research on consequences of video game play have conflated two distinct psychological mechanisms, habituation and generalization, into a unified process dubbed “desensitization.” The current paper reports the results of two studies, a repeated exposure study and a single exposure study, which examine habituation and generalization of biophysiological and self-reported arousal responses to violent video games. The findings indicate that repeated play leads to habituation in both biophysiological and self-report responses. Notably, evidence of generalization is more apparent in the biophysiological data. The results are discussed in terms of: (1) implications for game developers and players, (2) implications for game researchers, (3) current conceptual ambiguity between cross-sectional and longitudinal models, and (4) the appropriateness of utilizing self-report measures in longitudinal studies examining arousal. © 2015 National Communication Association.",doi,10.1080/03637751.2014.971418,Scopus,Communication Monographs,"Grizzard M., Tamborini R., Sherry J.L., Weber R., Prabhu S., Hahn L., Idzik P.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,The Use And Experience Of The New Video Media Among Children And Young Adolescents,"The media habits and experiences of 483 subjects whose ages ranged from 9 to 15 years were studied via the Experience Sampling Method. Respondents carried electronic paging devices and reported on their activities and subjective experiences when signaled. General descriptive findings on the use and experience of three forms of new video entertainment, music videos, video games, and videocassettes, are reported. For boys, these new video media were associated with higher reports of arousal and more positive affective states than was the case for the activities of television viewing, reading, and listening to popular music. Relative to boys, girls reported lower affect and arousal, especially during video games and music videos. © 1990, Sage.

,The Use Of Videogames As Complementary Therapeutic Tool For Cognitive Behavioral Therapy In Bulimia Nervosa Patients,"Although cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been demonstrated to be the most effective approach for the treatment of bulimia nervosa (BN), there is lack of studies showing whether a combination with a serious video game (SVG) might be useful to enhance patients' emotional regulation capacities and general outcome. The aims of this study were (a) to analyze whether outpatient CBT + SVG, when compared with outpatient CBT - SVG, shows better short-term outcome; (b) to examine whether the CBT + SVG group is more effective in reducing emotional expression and levels of anxiety than CBT - SVG. Thirty-eight patients diagnosed as having BN according to DSM-5 criteria were consecutively assigned to two outpatient group therapy conditions (that lasted for 16 weekly sessions): 20 CBT + SVG versus 18 CBT - SVG. Patients were assessed before and after treatment using not only a food and binging/purging diary and clinical questionnaires in the field of eating disorders but also additional indexes for measuring anger expression and anxiety. Regarding the post-treatment psychometric measures, most of the mean differences (Eating Disorder Inventory-2, Symptom Checklist-Revised, State-Trait Anxiety Index, and partially State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory) achieved moderate to high effect size (d > 0.5), in the sense that CBT + SVG obtained the best results compared with the CBT - SVG group. Regarding therapy outcome (dropout, partial remission, and total remission), CBT + SVG showed better results and a moderate effect size emerged for the comparison of the risk of dropout during the treatment, being higher for CBT - SVG compared with CBT + SVG (44.1 percent versus 20.0 percent, d = 0.54). Although the sample size in our study was low, and consequently results should be considered with caution, we have obtained promising findings suggesting that in the short-term CBT + SVG might be a good option not only for improving emotional dysregulation and approaching the current limitations of CBT - SVG in BN but also for enhancing the therapy adherence of patients. © Copyright 2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2015.",doi,10.1089/cyber.2015.0265,Scopus,"Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking","Fernandez-Aranda F., Jimenez-Murcia S., Santamaría J.J., Giner-Bartolomé C., Mestre-Bach G., Granero R., Sánchez I., Agüera Z., Moussa M.H., Magnenat-Thalmann N., Konstantas D., Lam T., Lucas M., Nielsen J., Lems P., Tarrega S., Menchón J.M.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,The Use Of Virtual Reality For Needle-Related Procedural Pain And Distress In Children And Adolescents In A Paediatric Oncology Unit,"Aim: It is essential to minimize pain and distress during painful procedures in children. This study examined the effect of using non-immersive Virtual Reality (VR) during a needle-related procedure on reported pain or distress of children and adolescents in a paediatric oncology unit and surveyed their response to the use of VR-equipment during the procedure. Method: Twenty-one children and adolescents were included in an intervention group with non-immersive VR and another 21 children and adolescents in a control group where they underwent either venous punctures or subcutaneous venous port devices. Self-reported pain and distress, heart rate and observational pain scores were collected before, during and after the procedures. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted in conjunction with the completed intervention. Results: Self-reported and observed pain and distress scores were low and few significant differences of quantitative data between the groups were found. Two themes emerged in the analysis of the interviews; the VR game should correspond to the child and the medical procedure and children enjoyed the VR game and found that it did distract them during the procedure. Conclusion: The interviews showed that non-immersive VR is a positive experience for children undergoing a minor procedure such as venous puncture or a subcutaneous venous port access. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Occupational therapists and physiotherapists in a rehabilitation hospital trialed four Wii games that addressed physical movement, balance, coordination, and cognitive performance. Then, they completed an opinion survey on the utility of Wii in rehabilitation. The results were compared between burn care therapists (BTs) and nonburn care therapists, using χ with a P < .05 considered significant. The participation rate was 79% (63/80), and they agreed that Wii was easy to set up (71%), operate (68%), and safe to use (76%). Participants agreed that Wii would be beneficial in outpatient (76%) and inpatient (65%) settings and that it could improve treatment compliance (73%). Participants recommended 15 to 30-minute Wii intervention (59%) daily (81%) and twice per week (43%). Participants believed that neurologic (71%), trauma (68%), burn (59%), and musculoskeletal (49%) patients would benefit from Wii intervention but not cardiac (43%) or organ transplant patients (18%). Participants believed that outcomes using Wii could be measured reliably (49%), and skills learned while playing could be transferable to daily function (60%). The significant differences between BTs and nonburn care therapists' perceptions are that BT-treated younger patients (21-40 years vs >60 years, P < .05) and BT favored the therapeutic benefit of Wii in rehabilitation (93% vs 58%, P = .02), specifically in burn rehabilitation (85% vs 39%, P = .001). Occupational therapists and physiotherapists favored the use of Wii in rehabilitation as an adjunct to traditional therapy because it is therapeutic, engaging, and may increase patient participation in rehabilitation. © 2010 by the American Burn Association.",doi,10.1097/BCR.0b013e3181eed23c,Scopus,Journal of Burn Care and Research,"Fung V., So K., Park E., Ho A., Shaffer J., Chan E., Gomez M.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Thermal Change In A Resin Block During Motorized And Manual Implant Placement,"Statement of problem Several studies have demonstrated the harmful role of heat generation during implant site drilling in subsequent bone healing. However, heat generation during implant placement should also be carefully considered. Purpose The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate thermal change in a resin block during motorized and manual implant placement with and without saline irrigation. Material and methods Thermocouple probes were placed in resin blocks to measure the thermal change during forty 3.75x15-mm self-tapping cylindrical screw implant placements as follows: MtI group, 10 motorized implant placements with external saline irrigation; MtNI group, 10 motorized implant placements without irrigation; MI group, 10 manual implant placements with external saline irrigation; MNI group, 10 manual implant placements without irrigation. The temperature values were recorded with a data acquisition system with a 20-channel multiplexer module connected to a personal computer. The normality of data distribution was assessed with the Shapiro-Wilk test and the homogeneity of variances with the Levene test. The mean temperatures of the groups was assessed with the 3-way ANOVA test followed by the Tukey HSD test for normal distribution and the Games-Howell test for non-normal distribution (α=.05). Results The rate of temperature rise in the resin blocks was 1.1°C to 7.3°C. The highest mean temperature was present in the group for manual implant placement without irrigation (26.2 ±1.1°C), and the lowest thermal change was in the motorized implant placement group with external saline irrigation (23.6 ±1.0°C). Conclusions The thermal change in resin blocks during motorized implant placement was lower than manual implant placement, especially with external saline irrigation. © 2016 Editorial Council for the Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry",doi,10.1016/j.prosdent.2016.04.021,Scopus,Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry,"Dal Molin Molinari A.R., Thomé C.A., Moura L.M., Kim S.H.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Towards Autonomous Behavior Learning Of Non-Player Characters In Games,"Non-Player-Characters (NPCs), as found in computer games, can be modelled as intelligent systems, which serve to improve the interactivity and playability of the games. Although reinforcement learning (RL) has been a promising approach to creating the behavior models of non-player characters (NPC), an initial stage of exploration and low performance is typically required. On the other hand, imitative learning (IL) is an effective approach to pre-building a NPC's behavior model by observing the opponent's actions, but learning by imitation limits the agent's performance to that of its opponents. In view of their complementary strengths, this paper proposes a computational model unifying the two learning paradigms based on a class of self-organizing neural networks called Fusion Architecture for Learning and COgnition (FALCON). Specifically, two hybrid learning strategies, known as the Dual-Stage Learning (DSL) and the Mixed Model Learning (MML), are presented to realize the integration of the two distinct learning paradigms in one framework. The DSL and MML strategies have been applied to creating autonomous non-player characters (NPCs) in a first person shooting game named Unreal Tournament. Our experiments show that both DSL and MML are effective in producing NPCs with faster learning speed and better combat performance comparing with those built by traditional RL and IL methods. The proposed hybrid learning strategies thus provide an efficient method to building intelligent NPC agents in games and pave the way towards building autonomous expert and intelligent systems for other applications. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

,Training Facial Expression Production In Children On The Autism Spectrum,"Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) show deficits in their ability to produce facial expressions. In this study, a group of children with ASD and IQ-matched, typically developing (TD) children were trained to produce ‘‘happy’’ and ‘‘angry’’ expressions with the FaceMaze computer game. FaceMaze uses an automated computer recognition system that analyzes the child’s facial expression in real time. Before and after playing the Angry and Happy versions of FaceMaze, children posed ‘‘happy’’ and ‘‘angry’’ expressions. Naïve raters judged the post-FaceMaze ‘‘happy’’ and ‘‘angry’’ expressions of the ASD group as higher in quality than their pre-FaceMaze productions. Moreover, the post-game expressions of theASDgroup were rated as equal in quality as the expressions of the TD group. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014.",doi,10.1007/s10803-014-2118-6,Scopus,Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders,"Gordon I., Pierce M.D., Bartlett M.S., Tanaka J.W.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Two-Dimensional Oscillatory Neural Network Based On Room-Temperature Charge-Density-Wave Devices,"We propose an oscillatory neural network implemented with two-dimensional (2-D) tantalum disulfide devices operating in the change density wave regime at room temperature. An elementary cell of the network consists of two 1T-TaS2 devices connected in series. Such a cell has a constant output and oscillatory states. All cells have the same bias voltage. There is a constant current flowing through the cell in the constant output mode. The oscillations occur at a certain bias voltage due to the electrical-field triggered metal-to-insulator transition owing to the changes in the charge-density-wave phase in the 1T-TaS2 channel. Two 1T-TaS2 devices oscillate out-of-phase when one of the devices is in the insulator phase while the other one is in the metallic state. The nearest-neighbor cells are coupled via graphene transistors. The cells are resistively coupled if the graphene transistor is in the on state while they are capacitively coupled if the transistor is in the off state. The operation of the oscillatory neural network is simulated numerically for the 30 × 30 node network. We present the examples of pattern recognition on a template with the fixed coupling among the near-neighbor cells. We also present the results of our numerical modeling mimicking the Game of Life in the network with the time-varying coupling. The 2-D 1T-TaS2 devices, utilized in the network, offer a unique combination of properties such as scalability, high operational frequency, fast synchronization speed, and radiation hardness, which makes them promising for both consumer electronic and defense applications. © 2002-2012 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TNANO.2017.2716845,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology,"Khitun A., Liu G., Balandin A.A.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Uncertainty And Engagement With Learning Games,"Uncertainty may be an important component of the motivation provided by learning games, especially when associated with gaming rather than learning. Three studies are reported that explore the influence of gaming uncertainty on engagement with computer-based learning games. In the first study, children (10-11 years) played a simple maths quiz. Participants chose their preferred reward for a correct answer prior to seeing each question. They could either receive a single point or toss an animated coin to receive 2 points for heads or none for tails. A preference for the uncertain option was revealed and this increased during the quiz. The second study explored the discourse around learning when pairs of participants (13-14 years) competed against the computer in a science quiz. Progress depended on the acquisition of facts but also on the outcomes of throwing dice. Discourse was characterised by a close intermingling of learning and gaming talk without salient problematic constructions regarding fairness when losing points due to gaming uncertainty. A final experiment explored whether, in this type of game, the uncertainty provided by the gaming component could influence players' affective response to the learning component. Electrodermal activity (EDA) of 16 adults was measured while they played the quiz with and without the element of chance provided by the dice. Results showed EDA when answering questions was increased by inclusion of gaming uncertainty. Findings are discussed in terms of the potential benefits of combining gaming uncertainty with learning and directions for further research in this area are outlined. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.",doi,10.1007/s11251-008-9073-6,Scopus,Instructional Science,"Howard-Jones P.A., Demetriou S.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,"Use Of Active-Play Video Games To Enhance Aerobic Fitness In Schizophrenia: Feasibility, Safety, And Adherence","Objective: Active-play video games have been used to enhance aerobic fitness in various clinical populations, but their use among individuals with schizophrenia has been limited. Methods: Feasibility, acceptability, safety, and adherence data were obtained for use of aerobic exercise (AE) equipment by 16 individuals with schizophrenia during a 12-week AE program consisting of three one-hour exercise sessions per week. Equipment included exercise video games for Xbox 360 with Kinect motion sensing devices and traditional exercise equipment. Results: Most participants (81%) completed the training, attending an average of 79% of sessions. The proportion of time spent playing Xbox (39%) exceeded time spent on any other type of equipment. When using Xbox, participants played 2.2461.59 games per session and reported high acceptability and enjoyment ratings, with no adverse events.

,User Experience In Digital Games: Differences Between Laboratory And Home,"Playing entertainment computer, video, and portable games, namely, digital games, is receiving more and more attention in academic research. Games are studied in different situations with numerous methods, but little is known about if and how the playing situation affects the user experience (UX) in games. In addition, it is hard to understand and study the psychology of UX in games. The objective of this study is to show how UX differs when the first-person shooter HALO is played in a laboratory and at home. To disclose this difference, a psychologically valid and multidimensional measurement framework is introduced. UX is profiled according to the level of the sense of presence, involvement, and flow in a between-subjects design. Statistically, the structure of the framework is grounded on a large and heterogeneous gamer data set (N = 2,182). The results showed that the profile of the sense of presence in the laboratory included higher levels of attention and arousal as compared with that of the natural environment. This finding was independent of any of the measured background variables. Other differences between the two situations were more related to the participants' background. For example, gamers at home were more involved in the game and they felt a higher level of competence. No strong emotional differences between the two situations were found. The authors discuss the complex UX terminology and implications of the framework for implementation of learning games. © 2011 SAGE Publications.",doi,10.1177/1046878110378353,Scopus,Simulation and Gaming,"Takatalo J., Häkkinen J., Kaistinen J., Nyman G.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas

,Using A Videogame To Facilitate Nursing And Medical Students' First Visit To The Operating Theatre. A Randomized Controlled Trial,"Background First experiences in the operating theatre with real patients are always stressful and intimidating for students. We hypothesized that a game-like simulation could improve perceptions and performance of novices. Methods A videogame was developed, combining pictures and short videos, by which students are interactively instructed on acting at the surgical block. Moreover, the game includes detailed descriptive information. After playing, students are given feedback on their performance. A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 132 nursing and medical students with no previous experience in surgery. Sixty two (47.0%) were allocated to a control group (CG) and 70 (53.0%) to an experimental group (EG). Subjects in EG played the game the day prior to their first experience in the theatre; CG had no access to the application. On the day after their experience at surgery, all students filled in a questionnaire in a 7-point Likert format collecting subjective data about their experience in the surgical block. Four constructs related to students' feelings, emotions and attitudes were measured through self-reported subjective scales, i.e. C1: fear to make mistakes, C2: perceived knowledge on how to behave, C3: perceived errors committed, and C4: attitude/behaviour towards patients and staff. The main research question was formulated as follows: do students show differences in constructs C1–C4 by exposure to the game? Results EG reported statistically significant higher scores on the four aspects measured than CG (p < 0.05; Mann-Whitney U tests; Cohen's d standardized effect size d1 = 0.30; d2 = 1.05; d3 = 0.39; d4 = 0.49). Conclusions Results show clear evidence that the exposure to the game-like simulation had a significant positive effect on all the constructs. After their first visit to the theatre, students in EG showed less fear (C1) and also perceived to have committed fewer errors (C3), while they showed higher perceived knowledge (C2) and a more collaborative attitude (C4). © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",doi,10.1016/j.nedt.2017.04.026,Scopus,Nurse Education Today,"del Blanco Á., Torrente J., Fernández-Manjón B., Ruiz P., Giner M.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Using An Educational Multimedia Application To Prepare Children For Outpatient Surgeries,"Surgery is a highly stressful event for children and caregivers. Extensive effort has been made to improve preoperative care in order to alleviate worry about the surgical procedure itself. This study tested the impact of an educational multimedia intervention on the cognitive, emotional, and physiological responses of children undergoing surgery, as well as on parental state anxiety. Children (n = 90) were assigned to three different groups: an educational multimedia intervention (experimental group), an entertainment video game intervention (comparison group), and a control group (no intervention). Children who received the educational multimedia intervention reported lower level of worries about hospitalization, medical procedures, illness, and negative consequences than those in the control and in the comparison groups. Parental state anxiety was also lower in the both the educational and the entertainment video game interventions compared to the control group. These findings suggest that providing information to children regarding medical procedures and hospital rules and routines is important to reduce their preoperative worries, and also relevant for parental anxiety.

,Using Multimodal Displays To Signify Critical Handovers Of Control To Distracted Autonomous Car Drivers,"Until full autonomy is achieved in cars, drivers will still be expected to take over control of driving, and critical warnings will be essential. This paper presents a comparison of abstract versus language-based multimodal warnings signifying handovers of control in autonomous cars. While using an autonomous car simulator, participants were distracted from the road by playing a game on a tablet. An automation failure together with a car in front braking was then simulated; a rare but very critical situation for a non-attentive driver to be in. Multimodal abstract or language-based warnings signifying this situation were then delivered, either from the simulator or from the tablet, in order to discover the most effective location. Results showed that abstract cues, including audio, and cues delivered from the tablet improved handovers. This indicates the potential of moving simple but salient autonomous car warnings to where a gaming side task takes place.

,Using Social Simulations To Assess And Train Potential Leaders To Make Effective Decisions In Turbulent Environments,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to describe two social simulations created to assess leadership potential and train leaders to make effective decisions in turbulent environments. One is set in the novel environment of a lunar moon colony and the other is a military combat command. The research generated from these simulations for assessing the decision effectiveness of potential leaders with different personality traits and decision styles under varying degrees of information quantity, uncertainty and complexity is summarized. Opportunities and limitations of applying current computer assisted technology to social simulations for assessing and developing leaders' decision effectiveness in turbulent environments is discussed. Design/methodology/ approach - College undergraduates and officer candidates in university ROTC programs made a series of decisions while being subjected to varying degrees of environmental turbulence in social simulations. The decision effectiveness of subjects with different personality characteristics under varying degrees of environmental turbulence was assessed through researcher observations, self-reports, and peer ratings. Findings - Social simulations are a cost effective way to assess and train leaders to make effective decisions in turbulent environments. The results of controlled experiments in social simulations have suggested that leaders with high levels of cognitive complexity and incongruity adaptation are more likely to be successful in highly turbulent environments than leaders with lower levels of incongruity adaptation ability and cognitive complexity who are more effective in more stable and structured situations. Research limitations/implications - The ease of modifying computer games renders them effective as low-cost virtual worlds that have relevance in military leadership experimentation. However, the use of computer simulations alone fails to capture the impact that relationships and emotions have on leader decision making, highlighting the continuing need for social simulations that include these interpersonal aspects of decision making. Practical implications - By participating in realistic social simulations, leaders can experiment with new decision styles without the risk of making real world mistakes that could jeopardize their own and their organization's future. The leaders who are most successful in adapting their decision style to the more complex requirements can be identified for promotion or assignment to appropriate settings. Originality/value - Both military and civilian organizations are in need of cost effective way to assess and train leaders to make effective decisions in turbulent environments. Social simulations provide a unique approach to meeting these needs and can simultaneously provide a venue for research in associated areas. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",doi,10.1108/13620430710756744,Scopus,Career Development International,Hunsaker P.L.,2007,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Utilising A Computer Game As A Therapeutic Intervention For Youth In Residential Care: Some Preliminary Findings On Use And Acceptability,"Mental illness is common amongst young people living in residential care, many of whom are reluctant to avail of therapeutic help. The potential value of computer games as therapeutic tools for these young people has received very little attention, despite indications of their potential for promoting engagement in therapeutic work and improving mental health outcomes. This study aimed to fill this research gap through the development, introduction, and preliminary evaluation of a therapeutic intervention in group care settings. The intervention incorporated a commercially available computer game (. The SIMS Life Stories™) and emotion regulation skill coaching. Qualified residential social workers were trained to deliver it to young people in three children's homes in Northern Ireland, where therapeutic approaches to social work had been introduced. The research was framed as an exploratory case study which aimed to determine the acceptability and potential therapeutic value of this intervention. The evidence suggests that computer-game based interventions of this type may have value as therapeutic tools in group care settings and deserve further development and empirical investigation to determine their effectiveness in improving mental health outcomes. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.childyouth.2014.10.012,Scopus,Children and Youth Services Review,"Aventin A., Houston S., Macdonald G.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Validating The Distinction Between Computer Addiction And Engagement: Online Game Playing And Personality,"This article considers validatory evidence for the previously made distinction between (pathological) computing-related addictions and (non-pathological) high engagement in computing activities, and an associated distinction between core and peripheral criteria for diagnosing computing-related addictions. Using data provided by 388 players of a massively multiplayer online role playing game (MMORPG) via an online questionnaire, psychometric measures of engagement and addiction to the MMORPG taking into account the distinction between core and peripheral addiction criteria are shown to be differentially related to personality factors (extraversion, emotional stability, agreeableness, negative valence, and attractiveness). Addiction scale scores are shown to increase as negativity on all five personality characteristics increases, with these characteristics predicting 20% of the variance in addiction scores, but the same pattern is shown to occur for only one characteristic (negative valence) for the engagement scale, with personality characteristics predicting only around 2% of the variance in engagement scores. It is concluded that there is reasonable support for the distinctions between addiction and engagement and between core and peripheral criteria. Implications are discussed. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.",doi,10.1080/01449290903401978,Scopus,Behaviour and Information Technology,"Charlton J.P., Danforth I.D.W.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Validation And Calibration Of Physical Activity Monitors In Children,"Objective: This study was designed to validate accelerometer-based activity monitors against energy expenditure (EE) in children; to compare monitor placement sites; to field-test the monitors; and to establish sedentary, light, moderate, and vigorous threshold counts. Research Methods and Procedures: Computer Science and Applications Actigraph (CSA) and Mini-Mitter Actiwatch (MM) monitors, on the hip or lower leg, were validated and calibrated against 6-hour EE measurements by room respiration calorimetry, activity by microwave detector, and heart rate by telemetry in 26 children, 6 to 16 years old. During the 6 hours, the children performed structured activities, including resting metabolic rate (RMR), Nintendo, arts and crafts, aerobic warm-up, Tae Bo, treadmill walking and running, and games. Activity energy expenditure (AEE) computed as EE - RMR was regressed against counts to derive threshold counts. Results: The mean correlations between EE or AEE and counts were slightly higher for MM-hip (r = 0.78 ± 0.06) and MM-leg (r = 0.80 ± 0.05) than CSA-hip (r = 0.66 ± 0.08) and CSA-leg (r = 0.73 ± 0.07). CSA and MM performed similarly on the hip (inter-instrument r = 0.88) and on the lower leg (inter-instrument r = 0.89). Threshold counts for the CSA-hip were <800, <3200, <8200, and ≥8200 for sedentary, light, moderate, and vigorous categories, respectively. For the MM-hip, the threshold counts were <100, <900, <2200, and ≥2200, respectively.

,"Video Games As A Complementary Therapy Tool In Mental Disorders: Playmancer, A European Multicentre Study","Background Previous review studies have suggested that computer games can serve as an alternative or additional form of treatment in several areas (schizophrenia, asthma or motor rehabilitation). Although several naturalistic studies have been conducted showing the usefulness of serious video games in the treatment of some abnormal behaviours, there is a lack of serious games specially designed for treating mental disorders.Aim The purpose of our project was to develop and evaluate a serious video game designed to remediate attitudinal, behavioural and emotional processes of patients with impulse-related disorders.Method and results The video game was created and developed within the European research project PlayMancer. It aims to prove potential capacity to change underlying attitudinal, behavioural and emotional processes of patients with impulse-related disorders. New interaction modes were provided by newly developed components, such as emotion recognition from speech, face and physiological reactions, while specific impulsive reactions were elicited. The video game uses biofeedback for helping patients to learn relaxation skills, acquire better self-control strategies and develop new emotional regulation strategies. In this article, we present a description of the video game used, rationale, user requirements, usability and preliminary data, in several mental disorders. © 2012 Informa UK, Ltd.",doi,10.3109/09638237.2012.664302,Scopus,Journal of Mental Health,"Fernández-Aranda F., Jiménez-Murcia S., Santamaría J.J., Gunnard K., Soto A., Kalapanidas E., Bults R.G.A., Davarakis C., Ganchev T., Granero R., Konstantas D., Kostoulas T.P., Lam T., Lucas M., Masuet-Aumatell C., Moussa M.H., Nielsen J., Penelo E.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,"Video Games In Adolescence And Emotional Functioning: Emotion Regulation, Emotion Intensity, Emotion Expression, And Alexithymia","Video-game users represent 40% of the French population and adolescents are the primary users. Yet excessive playing of video games has become a problem in modern society and is manifesting itself in treatment centers for adolescents. Before attempting to gain insight into this problematic use, we must understand video gaming itself and its implications for the gamer. The aim of this research is to propose an understanding of video-game playing based on some dimensions of emotional functioning such as emotion regulation, emotion intensity, emotion expression, and alexithymia. A total of 159 adolescents took part in the study. Regular gamers regulated their emotions more than irregular gamers did. They also felt their emotions more intensely. But regular gamers expressed their emotions less than irregular gamers did. Finally, the regular gamers' alexithymia level was higher than the irregular gamers' level. Especially, they had more difficulty being emotionally reactive. The avatar's evolution in the virtual environment may help mediate adolescents' problematic emotional experiences to give them meaning and enable their appropriation. As such, video games may act as a medium for projecting and experiencing one's emotional life by staging the emotional self, thereby explaining the engagement of adolescents in video gaming. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

,Virtual-Reality Distraction And Cold-Pressor Pain Tolerance: Does Avatar Point Of View Matter?,"This study tested the effects of distraction using virtual-reality (VR) technology on acute pain tolerance in young adults. Forty-one undergraduate students, aged 18-23 years, used a VR head-mounted display helmet, steering wheel, and foot pedal to play an auto racing video game while undergoing exposure to very cold water (cold pressor set at 1°C). Two different game views were tested that were hypothesized to affect the degree to which participants felt ""present"" in the virtual environment: a first-person view, in which the participant saw the virtual environment through the eyes of the game character being manipulated; and a third-person view, in which the participant viewed the game character from a distance. The length of time participants tolerated the cold-water exposure (pain tolerance) under each distraction condition was compared to a baseline (no distraction) trial. Subjects also rated the degree to which they felt ""present"" in the virtual environment after each distraction trial. Results demonstrated that participants had significantly higher pain tolerance during both VR-distraction conditions relative to baseline (no distraction) trials. Although participants reported a greater sense of presence during the first-person condition than the third-person condition, pain-tolerance scores associated with the two distraction conditions did not differ. The types of VR applications in which presence may be more or less important are discussed. © Copyright 2010, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",doi,10.1089/cyber.2009.0263,Scopus,"Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking","Dahlquist L.M., Herbert L.J., Weiss K.E., Jimeno M.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Virtual Reality As A Method For Evaluation And Therapy After Traumatic Hand Surgery,"In the last decade, Virtual Reality has encountered a continuous development concerning medical purposes and there are a lot of devices based on the classic 'cyberglove' concept that are used as new therapeutic method for upper limb pathology, especially neurologic problems [1;2;3]. One of the VR devices is Pablo (Tyromotion), with very sensitive sensors that can measure the hand grip strenght and the pinch force, also the ROM (range of motion) for all the joints of the upper limb (shoulder, elbow, wrist) and offering the possibility of interactive games based on Virtual Reality concept with application in occupational therapy programs. We used Pablo in our study on patients with hand surgery as an objective tool for assessment and as additional therapeutic method to the classic Rehabilitation program [4;5]. The results of the study proved that Pablo represents a modern option for evaluation of hand deficits and dysfunctions, with objective measurement replacement of classic goniometry and dynamometry, with computerized data base of patients with monitoring of parameters during the recovery program and with better muscular and neuro-cognitive feedback during the interactive therapeutic modules. © 2013 Interactive Media Institute and IOS Press.",doi,10.3233/978-1-61499-282-0-48,Scopus,Studies in Health Technology and Informatics,"Nica A.S., Brailescu C.M., Scarlet R.G.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Visual Perspectives Within Educational Computer Games: Effects On Presence And Flow Within Virtual Immersive Learning Environments,"The mis-categorizing of cognitive states involved in learning within virtual environments has complicated instructional technology research. Further, most educational computer game research does not account for how learning activity is influenced by factors of game content and differences in viewing perspectives. This study is a qualitative exploration into the nature of flow-the state of being absorbed by an activity, and presence-the sense of ""being there"" in a virtual learning environment. This study follows players' experiences within an immersive environment, with the notion of ""immersive"" being the extent to which the computer system delivers a surrounding environment. The data analysis includes videotaped activity, transcripts and interviews of six different games, three of which have explicit learning objectives derived from two different genres. While viewing perspective was previously thought to have significant influence on presence, flow, and learning, these findings suggest that four emergent categories (content, emotion, motivation, engagement) have more influence than perspective. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",doi,10.1007/s11251-010-9126-5,Scopus,Instructional Science,"Scoresby J., Shelton B.E.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Waves Of Regret: A Meg Study Of Emotion And Decision-Making,"Recent fMRI studies have investigated brain activity involved in the feeling of regret and disappointment by manipulating the feedback participants saw after making a decision to play certain gambles: full-feedback (regret: participant sees the outcomes from both the chosen and unchosen gamble) vs. partial-feedback (disappointment: participant only sees the outcome from chosen gamble). However, regret and disappointment are also characterized by differential agency attribution: personal agency for regret, external agency for disappointment. In this study, we investigate the neural correlates of these two characterizations of regret and disappointment using magnetoencephalography (MEG). To do this, we experimentally induced each emotion by manipulating feedback (chosen gamble vs. unchosen gamble), agency (human vs. computer choice) and outcomes (win vs. loss) in a fully randomized design. At the behavioral level the emotional experience of regret and disappointment were indeed affected by both feedback and agency manipulations. These emotions also differentially affect subsequent choices, with regret leading to riskier behavior. At the neural level both feedback and agency affected the brain responses associated with regret and disappointment, demonstrating differential localization in the brain for each. Notably, feedback regret showed greater brain activity in the right anterior and posterior regions, with agency regret producing greater activity in the left anterior region. These findings extend the evidence for neural activity in processing both regret and disappointment by highlighting for the first time the respective importance of feedback and agency, as well as outlining the temporal dynamics of these emotions. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2012.10.015,Scopus,Neuropsychologia,"Giorgetta C., Grecucci A., Bonini N., Coricelli G., Demarchi G., Braun C., Sanfey A.G.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Wear Behavior Of Seven Artificial Resin Teeth Assessed With Three-Dimensional Measurements,"Statement of problem. Artificial resin teeth are widely used for removable dental prostheses because of their excellent properties. An evaluation of their wear behavior is important for predicting good clinical performance.Purpose. The purpose of the study was to examine the wear behavior of 7 different artificial resin teeth with 3-dimensional measurements.Material and methods. The artificial denture teeth tested were 2 composite resin teeth (Yamahachi PX, Huge Kaijing), 3 cross-linked acrylic resin teeth (Cosmo HXL, Premium 8, Vita Lingoform), and 2 conventional acrylic resin teeth (Yamahachi FX, Shengjian). The specimens were subjected to an abrasive tester for masticatory simulation. The wear loss (vertical loss and volume loss) was determined with a confocal laser scanning microscope. Data were analyzed with 1-way ANOVA followed by the Games-Howell post hoc test (α=.05).Results. The mean vertical loss and volume loss for all cross-linked acrylic resin teeth (0.987-1.03 μm, 0.858-0.939 mm3 × 10-3) were higher than for all composite resin teeth (0.636-0.698 μm, 0.507-0.650 mm3 × 10-3, P&lt;.001) but lower than those for conventional acrylic resin teeth Yamahachi FX and Shengjian (1.39 μm, 1.24 mm3 × 10-3; 12.1 μm, 16.4 mm3 × 10-3; P&lt;.001). No significant differences for wear loss were found between the Vita Lingoform group and the other cross-linked acrylic resin teeth (P&gt;.05).Conclusion. The wear behavior of the artificial teeth examined differed with regard to their compositions. The composite resin teeth and high cross-linked acrylic resin teeth found superior wear resistance over the conventional acrylic resin teeth. © 2014 Editorial Council for the Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry.",doi,10.1016/j.prosdent.2014.04.030,Scopus,Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry,"Hao Z., Yin H., Wang L., Meng Y.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Weather Risk Management At The Olympic Winter Games,"The globally celebrated Olympic Winter Games (OWG) are highly dependent on suitable snow and ice conditions to support elite-level competitions. To determine the range of weather impacts on the Games, this study examines the official Olympic post-Games reports from 1924 to 2010. Impacts include preparations for the Games, holding outdoor opening–closing ceremonies, outdoor sporting competitions, spectator comfort, transportation, and television broadcasts. The study also examines the range of historical adaptations that have developed to manage weather risks at the OWG. Three adaptation eras are identified, spanning the history of the games: emergent adaptation, technological transition, and advanced adaptation. Analysis reveals that while weather-induced impacts have always been a part of the Games, these impacts would be far greater if not for technical climatic adaptations. With the average daytime temperature of host locations steadily increasing from 0.4°C at the Games held in the 1920–1950s to 7.8°C at the Games held in the twenty-first century, it would be difficult to imagine recent host cities/regions successfully delivering the diverse Games programme exclusively on natural ice and snow. The connection between the evolving needs for weather risk management strategies by Olympic organisers and the growth of the Olympics in size and scope is also discussed. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",doi,10.1080/13683500.2014.887665,Scopus,Current Issues in Tourism,"Rutty M., Scott D., Steiger R., Johnson P.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,What's Keeping Teenagers Up? Prebedtime Behaviors And Actigraphy-Assessed Sleep Over School And Vacation,"Purpose Technology-related behaviors (e.g., computer use) before bedtime (BT) have been associated with poorer and shorter sleep in adolescents; however, less is known about other behaviors in relation to sleep. This study characterized a range of behaviors in the hour before bed (i.e., pre-BT behaviors [PBBs]) and examined their relationship with sleep parameters during school and vacation periods (i.e., restricted and extended sleep opportunities, respectively). Mechanistic roles of chronotype and cognitive presleep arousal (PSAcog) were also examined. Methods During the last week of a school term and throughout a 2-week vacation, 146 adolescents (47.26% male, age M ± standard deviation = 16.2 ± 1.0 years) from the general community completed daily sleep measure using actigraphy, self-report measures on PBBs and PSAcog (Presleep Arousal Scale) for both school and vacation periods, and chronotype (Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire). Results Adolescents engaged in a variety of behaviors before bed. Notably, playing video games was associated with significantly later school and vacation BT and shorter school sleep duration (controlling for chronotype). During vacation, online social media was associated with significantly longer sleep onset latency, and this relationship was mediated by higher PSAcog. In contrast, on school nights, spending time with family was associated with significantly earlier BT and longer sleep duration. Conclusions Technology-related PBBs video games and online social media were risk factors for shorter and poorer sleep, whereas time with family was protective of sleep duration. In addressing sleep problems in adolescents, therapeutic procedures that target the potentially addictive nature of technology use and reduce PSAcog were implicated. © 2016 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

,What Is The Value Of Embedding Artificial Emotional Prosody In Human-Computer Interactions? Implications For Theory And Design In Psychological Science.,"In computerized technology, artificial speech is becoming increasingly important, and is already used in ATMs, online gaming and healthcare contexts. However, today's artificial speech typically sounds monotonous, a main reason for this being the lack of meaningful prosody. One particularly important function of prosody is to convey different emotions. This is because successful encoding and decoding of emotions is vital for effective social cognition, which is increasingly recognized in human-computer interaction contexts. Current attempts to artificially synthesize emotional prosody are much improved relative to early attempts, but there remains much work to be done due to methodological problems, lack of agreed acoustic correlates, and lack of theoretical grounding. If the addition of synthetic emotional prosody is not of sufficient quality, it may risk alienating users instead of enhancing their experience. So the value of embedding emotion cues in artificial speech may ultimately depend on the quality of the synthetic emotional prosody. However, early evidence on reactions to synthesized non-verbal cues in the facial modality bodes well. Attempts to implement the recognition of emotional prosody into artificial applications and interfaces have perhaps been met with greater success, but the ultimate test of synthetic emotional prosody will be to critically compare how people react to synthetic emotional prosody vs. natural emotional prosody, at the behavioral, socio-cognitive and neural levels.",doi,10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01750,pubmed,Frontiers in psychology,"Mitchell, Rachel L C; Xu, Yi",2015,NA,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,"What Makes Good Games Go Viral? The Role Of Technology Use, Efficacy, Emotion And Enjoyment In Players' Decision To Share A Prosocial Digital Game","Serious digital games may be an effective tool for prosocial message dissemination because they offer technology and experiences that encourage players to share them with others, and spread virally. But little is known about the factors that predict players' willingness to share games with others in their social network. This panel study explores how several factors, including sharing technology use, emotional responses, and game enjoyment, contribute to players' decision to share the game Darfur is Dying, with others. College students played the game and completed questionnaires that assessed whether they had shared the games at two different time points: during game play and after game play. Positive emotions predicted sharing while students played the game, but negative emotions predicted whether the game was shared after initial game play. Game enjoyment predicted players' intentions to share the game, but it did not predict actual sharing behavior. Neither players' general use of sharing technologies nor their satisfaction related to sharing digital content predicted sharing intentions or behavior. These findings have implications for the study of viral social marketing campaigns, and serious game design and theory. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

,What We Can Learn About Digital Badges From Video Games,"This chapter discusses the use of achievements within commercial video game design and development. It also summarizes research designed around specialized learning games designed to test the effectiveness of badges on learner variables such as performance and motivation. To connect game achievements to digital badges in other educational scenarios, both psychological and design factors are considered. First, connections between games research and learner motivation are discussed, especially in regards to autonomy, mastery, and purpose. Implications for measurement and assessment are considered and strategies for evaluation from prior games researchers are reviewed. Next, an overview of achievement systems within popular game environments is provided. The second half of the chapter considers best practices for designing badges as proposed by game achievement researchers. One game, Fallout Shelter, is discussed in detail in regards to its use of effective achievement design. Educational badge designers who may be working in game-based systems or other interactive learning spaces can use this information to build better badging systems in other realms of learning. The chapter also shares some caveats gleaned from the use of achievements in video games. These cautionary notes about achievements taken too far, or achievements that overpower other features of learning spaces, are useful to consider for using digital badges effectively in educational environments. The chapter concludes by proposing directions for future research exploring the connections between video game achievements and digital badges. © 2016 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",doi,10.1007/978-3-319-15425-1_18,Scopus,Foundation of Digital Badges and Micro-Credentials: Demonstrating and Recognizing Knowledge and Competencies,McDaniel R.,2016,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,When Bad Emotions Seem Better: Experience Changes The Automatic Evaluation Of Anger,"Evaluations of objects change as a function of our experience with them. We suggest that this also applies to the evaluation of emotions. In three studies, we show that the evaluation of anger changes as a function of direct experience with anger. We found that the experience of anger in a context in which it could be beneficial (i.e., an aggressive computer game) led people to perceive anger as more useful (Study 1). Moreover, people came to evaluate anger less negatively after experiencing anger in a context in which it could be beneficial. These changes did not result from the mere experience of anger or from exposure to an aggressive context (Study 2). Rather, the more anger improved their performance, the less negatively participants came to evaluate anger (Study 3). These findings suggest that how bad anger seems may depend on our direct experience with it. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.",doi,10.1177/1948550615584198,Scopus,Social Psychological and Personality Science,"Netzer L., Igra L., Anan Y.B., Tamir M.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Whistle-Blowing: Not Always A Losing Game,"The experiences of five engineers in nuclear power, aerospace, and air-traffic control who followed their consciences are recounted. In one case, which took place in 1976, three engineers quit General Electric Co.'s nuclear division to protest alleged inadequate testing and unsafe designs, not only at GE but throughout the nuclear industry. In 1981, a Federal Aviation Administration engineer appeared on a television show charging that lives have been lost because of the agency's mishandling of collision avoidance system development. In 1986, engineers at Morton Thiokol Inc. warned against the launch of the space shuttle Challenger because low temperatures predicted for the next morning might stiffen 0-rings. In all three cases, the whistle-blowers have by now been vindicated to a degree for their actions, though the verdict may not be unanimous, and the careers of the first group may have even benefited by blowing the whistle.",doi,10.1109/6.60938,Scopus,IEEE Spectrum,Fitzgerald Karen,1990,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Wii Has Never Been Modern: 'Active' Video Games And The 'Conduct Of Conduct',"This article considers the role of 'active' video games ĝ€"" specifically the Nintendo 'Wii' ĝ€"" as technologies that foster control over corporeality. New media scholars have examined the politics of embodiment and hybridity as they relate to video games, yet have paid limited attention to the ways in which new gaming technologies might contribute to contemporary systems of 'government', or what Foucault calls the 'conduct of conduct'. Borrowing from influential social theorists, the article argues that, by undergoing what Latour labels 'translation' (by merging with the body), the Wii invokes and reinscribes governmental and post-disciplinary rationalities. The analysis concludes by contending that the Wii might be a particularly influential innovation in risk-based post-disciplinary societies: rather than connecting 'at-risk' subjects to human experts, the Wii functions as an active and autonomous quasi-object risk expert, able to diagnose 'problematic' tendencies and prescribe basic behavioural remedies. © 2009 SAGE Publications.",doi,10.1177/1461444809102966,Scopus,New Media and Society,Millington B.,2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,"Winning Isn’t Everything: Mood And Testosterone Regulate The Cortisol Response In Competition. Plos One, 8(1).","Dominance contests are recurrent and widespread causes of stress among mammals. Studies of activation of the stress axis in social defeat – as reflected in levels of adrenal glucocorticoid, cortisol – have generated scattered and sometimes contradictory results, suggesting that biopsychological individual differences might play an important mediating role, at least in humans. In the context of a larger study of the regulation of endocrine responses to competition, we evaluated the notion that mood states, such as self-assurance and hostility, may influence cortisol reactivity to dominance cues via an interplay with baseline testosterone, considered as a potential marker of individual differences in dominance. Seventy healthy male university students (mean age 20.02, range 18–26) provided saliva samples before and after competing for fifteen minutes on a rigged computer task. After a winner was determined, all participants were assessed on their mood states through a standardized psychometric instrument (PANAS-X). Among winners of a rigged videogame competition, we found a significant interaction between testosterone and self-assurance in relation to post-competition cortisol. Specifically, self-assurance was associated with lower post-competition cortisol in subjects with high baseline testosterone levels, but no such relationship was observed in subjects with lower baseline testosterone levels. In losers of the competition no interaction effect between basal testosterone and hostility was observed. However, in this subgroup a significant negative relationship between basal testosterone and post-competition cortisol was evident. Overall, these findings provide initial support for the novel hypothesis that biological motivational predispositions (i.e. basal testosterone) and state (i.e. mood changes) may interact in regulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation after a social contest.",doi,10.1371/journal.pone.0052582,nagy2015,PLoS ONE,"Zilioli, S., Watson, N.

,Women's Comedy Preferences During The Menstrual Cycle,"Females in different phases of their menstrual cycle were given the opportunity to select comedy, drama, and game-show programs for an evening's worth of watching television. Additionally, they rated their enjoyment of a battery of cartoons and watched excerpts from several television programs. It was found that premenstrual and menstrual women preferred comedy over alternative choices more strongly than did women midway through the cycle. It is suggested that this preference reflects a desire to overcome the hormonally mediated noxious mood states that are characteristically associated with the premenstrual and menstrual phases of the cycle. Appreciation of humor and comedy was not found to vary with cycle phases, however. © 1987, Sage.

,"Work Content Influences On Cognitive Task Load, Emotional State And Performance During A Simulated 520-Days' Mars Mission","In high-risk domains such as human space flight, cognitive performances can be negatively affected by emotional responses to events and conditions in their working environment (e.g., isolation and health incidents). The COgnitive Performance and Error (COPE) model distinguishes effects of work content on cognitive task load and emotional state, and their effect on the professional's performance. This paper examines the relationships between these variables for a simulated Mars-mission. Six volunteers (well-educated and -motivated men) were isolated for 520 days in a simulated spacecraft in which they had to execute a (virtual) mission to Mars. As part of this mission, every other week, several computer tasks were performed. These tasks consisted of a negotiation game, a chat-based learning activity and an entertainment game. Before and after these tasks, and after post-task questionnaires, the participants rated their emotional state consisting of arousal, valence and dominance, and their cognitive task load consisting of level of information processing, time occupied and task-set switches. Results revealed significant differences between cognitive task load and emotional state levels when work content varied. Significant regression models were also found that could explain variation in task performance. These findings contribute to the validation of the COPE model and suggest that differences in appraisals for tasks may bring about different emotional states and task performances. © 2015 The Authors.

,Worldcupinion: Experiences With An Android App For Real-Time Opinion Sharing During Soccer World Cup Games,"Mobile devices are increasingly used in social networking applications and research. So far, there is little work on real-time emotion or opinion sharing in large loosely coupled user communities. One potential area of application is the assessment of widely broadcasted television (TV) shows. The idea of connecting non-collocated TV viewers via telecommunication technologies is referred to as Social TV. Such systems typically include set-top boxes for supporting the collaboration. In this work the authors investigated whether mobile phones can be used as an additional channel for sharing opinions, emotional responses, and TV-related experiences in real-time. To gain insight into this area, an Android app was developed for giving real-time feedback during soccer games and to create ad hoc fan groups. This paper presents results on rating activity during games and discusses experiences with deploying this app over four weeks during soccer World Cup. In doing so, challenges and opportunities faced are highlighted and an outlook on future work in this area is given.

,Analysis Of The Work Rates And Heart Rates Of Association Football Referees,"This study aimed to describe the work-rate profiles of referees during soccer matches and record heart-rate responses during these games. Using video-recordings 14 referees were observed and their heart rates during the games were monitored by short-range radio telemetry. These included 11 football league matches. The exercise intensity was largely submaximal with a change in activity every 6s. The mean distance covered during the game was 9.44km; a significant fall in work rate was noted in the second half (P &lt; 0.05). The mean heart rate of 165 beats min-1 did not vary between first and second halves. The work rate and heart rate varied more between individuals than with the importance of the match, but this variation was small. It was considered that refereeing top level soccer places high physiological demands on the official.

,Central Adiposity And Hemodynamic Functioning At Rest And During Stress In Adolescents,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the impact of central adiposity upon hemodynamic functioning at rest and during stress in adolescents. DESIGN: Cross-sectional, correlational study. SUBJECTS: 46 White and 49 Black normotensive adolescents with family histories of essential hypertension. MEASUREMENTS: Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), cardiac output and total peripheral resistance responses were assessed at rest, during postural change, video game challenge and forehead cold stimulation. Specific lower and higher waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) tertiles were created for each gender and then integrated for analyses. This resulted in a lower WHR tertile of 11 Whites and 21 Blacks and an upper WHR tertile of 15 Whites and 17 Blacks. RESULTS: No differences in age, gender or ethnicity proportions were found between tertile groups (all P > 0.21). The upper WHR group showed greater body weight, waist and hip circumferences, body mass index (BMI), triceps skinfold and body surface area (all P < 0.001). Controlling for peripheral (that is, triceps skinfold) and overall (that is, BMI) adiposity, the upper WHR group exhibited greater SBP (that is, peak response minus mean pre-stresser level) to all three stressors and greater DBP reactivity to postural change and cold presser (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Central adiposity appears to adversely influence hemodynamic functioning during adolescence.

,"Dependence Of Young Female Volleyballers' Performance On Their Body Build, Physical Abilities, And Psycho-Physiological Properties","Aim. The aim of the study was to establish which anthropometric characteristics, physical abilities and psycho-physiological properties determine the success of adolescent female volleyballers at competitions. Methods. For this purpose we studied 32 female volleyballers aged 13-16 years. The anthropometric examination included 43 measurements, 7 tests of physical fitness, and 4 series of computerised psycho-physiological tests (n=21). The Performance of game elements was measured empirically during championship games using the original computer program ""Game"". Results. The proficiency of performing volleyball elements-serve, reception, feint, block and spike - was calculated by regression models from the 14 anthropometric measurements, 4 physical fitness and 7 psychophysiological test results, which showed significant correlation with proficiency in the game. The predictive power of the models was at least 32 % and in average 56%. The anthropometric factor was significant in the performance of all the elements of the game, being most essential (71-83 %) for attack, block and feint. Good results in physical ability tests granted success in serve, attack and reception. Conclusion. It was possible to predict the efficiency of reception (44 %) by endurance, flexibility and speed measuring tests. Medicine ball throwing test was essential for attack (22%). Psycho-physiological tests were significant for the performance of block (98 %), attack (80 %), feint (60 %) and reception (39 %).",pmid,14625509,Scopus,Journal of Sports Medicine and Physical Fitness,"Stamm R., Veldre G., Stamm M., Thomson K., Kaarma H., Loko J., Koskel S.",2003,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas

,Determinants Of Retinal Vascular Abnormalities In Children And Adolescents With Essential Hypertension,"The predictors of retinal vascular abnormalities in patients with elevated BP have not been studied extensively in children or adults. The purpose of this study was to investigate potential correlates of arteriolar narrowing, tortuosity and arteriovenous nicking in a population of children and adolescents with essential hypertension. A total of 97 subjects, aged 6-23 years, were studied. Retinal vascular abnormalities were determined by photographs of the optic fundus which were interpreted independently by two opthalmologists. In 50 subjects (51%) there were one or more abnormalities. Potential correlates of retinal abnormalities included: (1) demographic factors, (2) body size, (3) level of BP and duration of hypertension, (4) family history of cardiovascular disease, (5) treatment with antihypertensive medication, (6) dietary sodium intake, (7) laboratory analyses, (8) the reactivity of BP and heart rate to playing a video game, and (9) cardiovascular reactivity to exercise. Using stepwise multiple logistic regression, the variables that were independently associated with the presence of retinal vascular abnormalities were family income, dietary sodium intake, fasting blood glucose, pulse pressure during mental stress and the change in SBP from rest to maximum exercise. In addition, subjects with more than one retinal vascular abnormality had higher average DBP during follow-up in the Hypertension Clinic and a smaller rise in SBP from rest to maximum exercise. Identification of these independent predictors of retinal vascular abnormalities and factors associated with more than one abnormality may provide insight into the pathogenesis of hypertensive vascular disease.",pmid,8345488,Scopus,Journal of Human Hypertension,"Daniels S.R., Lipman M.J., Burke M.J., Loggie J.M.H.",1993,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas

,Electronic Gaming As Pain Distraction,"The current study investigated whether active distraction reduces participants' experience of pain more than passive distraction during a cold pressor task. In the first experiment, 60 participants were asked to submerge their hand in cold (2°C) water for as long as they could tolerate. They did this with no distraction, and then with active (electronic gaming system) and passive (television) distraction, in randomly assigned order. Tolerance time, pain intensity ratings and task absorption ratings were measured for each condition. A second experiment attempted to control for participants'expectations about the effects of distraction on pain. Forty participants underwent the same experimental procedure, but were given verbal suggestions about the effects of distraction by the experimenter before each distraction condition. Participants in both experiments had a significantly higher pain tolerance and reported less pain with the active distraction compared with passive or no distraction. Participants reported being more absorbed, and were significantly more willing to do the task again when they had the active distraction compared with both passive distraction and no distraction. They also had more enjoyment, less anxiety and greater reduction in pain with active distraction than with passive distraction. There was no effect of suggestion. These experiments offer further support for the use of electronic games as a method of pain control. ©2011 Pulsus Group Inc.

,Energy Metabolism During Activity-Promoting Video Games Practice In Subjects With Spinal Cord Injury: Evidences For Health Promotion,"Background: Activity promoting video game (APVG) practice significantly affects energy metabolism through energy expenditure (EE) increase and has been recently included in strategies for health promotion. It is not known if the APVG practice provides similar outcomes in subjects with spinal cord injury (SCI). Aim: Aim of the study was to evaluate cardio-pulmonary and metabolic adaptations during APVG practice and to find whether EE increase above resting condition could suggest the inclusion of this exercise in a more general strategy for health promotion and body weight control in subjects with SCI. Design: Repeated measures study. Setting: Rehabilitation Institute. Population: Ten male subjects with SCI (lesion levels from C7 to L1) age 26 to 55 years. Methods: We recorded pulmonary ventilation (VE), oxygen consumption (VO 2) for EE esteem and heart rate (HR) at rest and while playing virtual bowling, tennis and boxing games using a portable metabolimeter equipped with ECG electrodes. The standard metabolic equivalent of task (METs) was calculated offline. The metabolic and functional parameters were referred to the 10th minute of each activity. Results: Metabolic and functional parameters increased significantly from rest to bowling, tennis and boxing. METs exceeded in average 3 during boxing. One hour of APVG can increase daily EE by about 6% (bowling), 10% (tennis) and 15% (boxing). Conclusion: These considerable results suggest that physical exertion during APVG practice in subjects with SCI could contribute to health promotion as well as caloric balance control, especially when boxing is considered. This can be safely achieved at home with regular activity. Clinical rehabilitation impact: These findings substantiate the potential for novel exercise modalities to counteract deconditioning due to inactivity in subjects with SCI by promoting physical activity through implementation of APVG exercise programs.",pmid,23370043,Scopus,European Journal of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine,"Gaffurini P., Bissolotti L., Calza S., Calabretto C., Orizio C., Gobbo M.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Ethnicity And Socioeconomic Status: Impact On Cardiovascular Activity At Rest And During Stress In Youth With A Family History Of Hypertension,"Objective: The purpose of the present study was to examine the potential interaction of ethnicity and SES on hemodynamic functioning at rest and during acute stress in normotensive adolescents with a family history of essential hypertension (EH). Design: The influences of ethnicity and socioeconomic status (SES) on cardiovascular function were evaluated at rest and in response to five different laboratory stressors. Methods: 110 (50 female) Caucasian and 162 (85 female) African-American normotensive youth (initial age 11.2 ± 2.4 years) with a family history of essential hypertension (EH) were tested on two occasions, an average of 2.5 years apart. Based on previous findings, it was predicted that African Americans, particularly those of low SES, would exhibit higher resting blood pressure (BP) and greater cardiovascular reactivity to acute laboratory stressors than would Caucasians. Results: As predicted, African-American youth exhibited higher resting diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and total peripheral resistance (TPR) than Caucasians on both visits (both Ps<.04). African Americans exhibited greater systolic blood pressure (SBP) reactivity than did Caucasians to the video game stressor during both lab visits (both Ps<.02) and greater heart rate reactivity during the first lab visit (P<.01). African Americans exhibited greater SBP and/or DBP, and TPR reactivity to the cold pressor during the first lab visit and the parent-child discussion during the second visit (all Ps<.03). Conclusion: As predicted, African Americans exhibited higher resting BP and TPR, and greater cardiovascular reactivity than Caucasians. Although not in the predicted direction, a pattern of interactions began to emerge on the second evaluation. For example, upper SES youth exhibited greater heart rate reactivity compared to all other groups on the social competence interview and parent-child discussion stressors. Further study is needed to clarify the role cardiovascular reactivity may play in the link between ethnicity, SES, and cardiovascular disease risk.

,Getting The Attention You Need.,"Employees have an enormous amount of business information at their fingertips--more specifically, at their desktops. The floodgates are open; profitable possibilities abound. But having to handle all that information has pushed downsized staffs to the brink of an acute attention deficit disorder. To achieve corporate goals, business leaders need their employees' full attention--and that attention is in short supply. Authors Thomas Davenport and John Beck have studied how companies manage the attention of their employees and their site visitors. In this article, they analyze the components of attention management through three lenses--economic, psychobiological, and technological--and offer guidelines for keeping employees focused on crucial corporate tasks. Their lessons are drawn from the best practices employed by today's stickiest Web sites and by traditional attention industries such as advertising, film, and television. The authors say executives must manage attention knowing that it's a zero-sum game (there's only so much to go around). Managers should also consider capitalizing on the basic survival and competitive instincts we all have that help determine how much attention we pay to certain things. For instance, the threat of corporate demise--and the consequent loss of jobs and livelihoods--undoubtedly focuses workers' attention on the need to change. Likewise, internal competition among business units may give employees added incentive to pay attention to a profit or sales goal. Leaders today need to pay more attention to attention because it's widely misunderstood and widely mismanaged, the authors conclude.",pmid,11143148,Scopus,Harvard business review,"Davenport T.H., Beck J.C.",2e3,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,How Avatar Customizability Affects Children's Arousal And Subjective Presence During Junk Food-Sponsored Online Video Games.,"The purpose of this study was to determine how children cognitively and emotionally process interactive marketing of snack food products in advergames. Children (N = 30) aged 10 to 12 were asked to play advergames with (a) avatars that were assigned to them, (b) avatars chosen from a pool, and (c) self-designed avatars. The children's skin conductance levels were collected during play. After gameplay, at each customization level, self-reported presence was collected. The results of this study indicate that customization of game avatars can affect both subjective feelings of presence and psychophysiological indicators of emotion during gameplay, which may make the gameplay experience more enjoyable. This may have implications for game sponsors and producers. Self-reported presence had no effect on psychophysiological indicators of emotion during gameplay. Implications of this finding and limitations of this study are discussed.",pmid,19445632,Scopus,"Cyberpsychology & behavior : the impact of the Internet, multimedia and virtual reality on behavior and society","Bailey R., Wise K., Bolls P.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Imagining Wrong: Fictitious Contexts Mitigate Condemnation Of Harm More Than Impurity,"Over 5 experiments, we test the fictive pass asymmetry hypothesis. Following observations of ethics and public reactions to media, we propose that fictional contexts, such as reality, imagination, and virtual environments, will mitigate people's moral condemnation of harm violations, more so than purity violations. That is, imagining a purely harmful act is given a ""fictive pass,"" in moral judgment, whereas imagining an abnormal act involving the body is evaluated more negatively because it is seen as more diagnostic of bad character. For Experiment 1, an undergraduate sample (N = 250) evaluated 9 vignettes depicting an agent committing either violations of harm or purity in real life, watching them in films, or imagining them. For Experiments 2 and 3, online participants (N = 375 and N = 321, respectively) evaluated a single vignette depicting an agent committing a violation of harm or purity that either occurred in real life, was imagined, watched in a film, or performed in a video game. Experiment 4 (N = 348) used an analysis of moderated mediation to demonstrate that the perceived wrongness of fictional purity violations is explained both by the extent to which they are seen as a cue to, and a cause of, a poor moral character. Lastly, Experiment 5 (N = 484) validated our manipulations and included the presumption of desire as an additional mediator of the fictive pass asymmetry effects. We discuss implications for moral theories of act and character, anger and disgust, and for media use and regulation. © 2017 American Psychological Association.",pmid,28054817,Scopus,Journal of Experimental Psychology: General,"Sabo J.S., Giner-Sorolla R.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,"Immediate And Long-Term Effects Of Meditation On Acute Stress Reactivity, Cognitive Functions, And Intelligence","Context With the current globalization of the world's economy and demands for enhanced performance, stress is present universally. Life's stressful events and daily stresses cause both deleterious and cumulative effects on the human body. The practice of meditation might offer a way to relieve that stress. Objective The research team intended to study the effects of meditation on stress-induced changes in physiological parameters, cognitive functions, intelligence, and emotional quotients. Methods The research team conducted the study in two phases, with a month between them. Each participant served as his own control, and the first phase served as the control for the second phase. In phase 1, the research team studied the effects of a stressor (10 minutes playing a computer game) on participants' stress levels. In phase 2, the research team examined the effects of meditation on stress levels. Setting The research team conducted the study in a lab setting at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India. Participants The participants were 34 healthy, male volunteers who were students. Intervention To study the effects of long-term meditation on stress levels, intelligence, emotional quotients, and cognitive functions participants meditated daily for 1 month, between phases 1 and 2. To study the immediate effects of meditation on stress levels, participants meditated for 15 minutes after playing a computer game to induce stress. Outcome Measures The research team measured galvanic skin response (GSR), heart rate (HR), and salivary cortisol and administered tests for the intelligence and emotional quotients (IQ and EQ), acute and perceived stress (AS and PS), and cognitive functions (ie, the Sternberg memory test [short-term memory] and the Stroop test [cognitive flexibility]). Using a pre-post study design, the team performed this testing (1) prior to the start of the study (baseline); (2) in phase 1, after induced stress; (3) in part 1 of phase 2, after 1 month of daily meditation, and (4) in part 2 of phase 2, after induced stress, both before and after 15 minutes of meditation. Results Induced stress from the computer game resulted in a significant increase in physiological markers of stress such as GSR and HR. In the short term, meditation was associated with a physiological relaxation response (significant decrease in GSR) and an improvement in scores on the Stroop test of reaction times. In the long term, meditation brought significant improvements in IQ and scores for cognitive functions, whereas participants' stress levels (GSR and AS) decreased. EQ, salivary cortisol, and HR showed no significant changes. Conclusions The practice of meditation reduced psychological stress responses and improved cognitive functions, and the effects were pronounced with practice of meditation for a longer duration (1 month).",pmid,23251943,Scopus,Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine,"Singh Y., Sharma R., Talwar A.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Isolated Core Vs. Superficial Cooling Effects On Virtual Maze Navigation,"Introduction: Cold impairs cognitive performance and is a common occurrence in many survival situations. Altered behavior patterns due to impaired navigation abilities in cold environments are potential problems in lost-person situations. We investigated the separate effects of low core temperature and superficial cooling on a spatially demanding virtual navigation task. Methods: There were 12 healthy men who were passively cooled via 15°C water immersion to a core temperature of 36.0°C, then transferred to a warm (40°C) water bath to eliminate superficial shivering while completing a series of 20 virtual computer mazes. In a control condition, subjects rested in a thermoneutral (∼35°C) bath for a time-matched period before being transferred to a warm bath for testing. Superficial cooling and distraction were achieved by whole-body immersion in 35°C water for a time-matched period, followed by lower leg immersion in 10°C water for the duration of the navigational tests. Results: Mean completion time and mean error scores for the mazes were not significantly different (p > 0.05) across the core cooling (16.59 ± 11.54 s, 0.91 ± 1.86 errors), control (15.40 ± 8.85 s, 0.82 ± 1.76 errors), and superficial cooling (15.19 ± 7.80 s, 0.77 ± 1.40 errors) conditions. Discussion: Separately reducing core temperature or increasing cold sensation in the lower extremities did not influence performance on virtual computer mazes, suggesting that navigation is more resistive to cooling than other, simpler cognitive tasks. Further research is warranted to explore navigational ability at progressively lower core and skin temperatures, and in different populations.

,Memory For Friends Or Foes: The Social Context Of Past Encounters With Faces Modulates Their Subsequent Neural Traces In The Brain.,"Every day we encounter new people, interact with them, and form person impressions based on quick and automatic inferences from minimal contextual information. Previous studies have identified an extensive network of brain areas involved in familiar face recognition, but there is little evidence to date concerning the neural bases of negative vs. positive person impressions. In the present study, participants were repeatedly exposed to 16 unfamiliar face identities within a pseudo-interactive game context to generate a perception of either ""friends"" or ""foes"". Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was then performed during an old/new memory task to assess any difference in brain responses to these now familiar face identities, relative to unfamiliar faces. Importantly, whereas facial expressions were always emotional (either smiling or angry) during the encoding phase, they were always neutral during the memory task. Our results reveal that several brain regions involved in familiar face recognition, including fusiform cortex, posterior cingulate gyrus, and amygdala, plus additional areas involved in motivational control such as caudate and anterior cingulate cortex, were differentially modulated as a function of a previous encounter, and generally more activated when faces were perceived as ""foes"" rather than ""friends"". These findings underscore that a key dimension of social judgments, based on past impressions of who may be supportive or hostile, may lead to long-lasting effects on memory for faces and thus influence affective reactions to people during a subsequent encounter even in a different (neutral) context.",pmid,19637101,Scopus,Social neuroscience,"Vrticka P., Andersson F., Sander D., Vuilleumier P.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Pet Studies Of The Effects Of Aerobic Exercise On Human Striatal Dopamine Release,"In vivo microdialysis studies have shown that exercise increases the concentration of dopamine (DA) in the striatum of the rat brain. It has also been shown that PET with [11C]raclopride can be used to assess changes in brain DA induced by drugs and by performance tasks such as playing a video game. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of exercise (treadmill running) on striatal DA release in the human brain. Methods: Twelve healthy volunteers (5 women, 7 men; mean age, 32 ± 5 y; age range, 25-40 y) with a history of regular exercise received 2 PET scans with [11C]raclopride on 2 separate days, 1 at baseline and 1 at 5-10 min after running on a treadmill for 30 min. The speed and inclination of the treadmill were increased gradually to reach a maximal speed of 9.7 km/h (6 mph) and a maximal inclination of 10°. Data were acquired on a Siemens HR+ scanner in 3-dimensional mode for 60 min. Heart rates and electrocardiograms were monitored. DA D2 receptor availability was measured using the ratio of the distribution volume in the putamen to that in the cerebellum, which is a function of the number of available binding sites/dissociation constant. Results: The subjects ran at an average speed of 8.7 ± 0.5 km/h (5.4 ± 0.3 mph) and at an inclination of 3.3°± 2°. The maximum effort of running was maintained for 10-15 min. The heart rates of the subjects were increased by 143% ± 47%. DA D2 receptor availability in the putamen after treadmill running (4.22 ± 0.34) was no different from that of baseline (4.17 ± 0.29; P &lt; 0.6). Conclusion: No significant changes in synaptic DA concentration were detected, although the subjects exercised vigorously for 30 min.",pmid,10945526,Scopus,Journal of Nuclear Medicine,"Wang G.-J., Volkow N.D., Fowler J.S., Franceschi D., Logan J., Pappas N.R., Wong C.T., Netusil N.",2e3,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Physiological And Perceptual Responses To Nintendo® Wii Fit™ In Young And Older Adults.,"Physically active video gaming (AVG) provides a technologically-modern, convenient means of increasing physical activity (PA). This study examined cardiovascular, metabolic, and perceptual responses in young adult (AP) and older adult (OP) participants engaging in Wii FitTM AVG play, and compared PA levels during play to recommended PA levels. Heart rate (HR), percent heart rate reserve (%HRR), oxygen consumption (VO2), energy expenditure (EE), rating of perceived exertion (RPE), enjoyment level (EL), and step count data were obtained from 10 YP and 10 OP during 15 minutes of rest and four 15-minute bouts of Wii FitTM activities (yoga, balance, aerobics, strength). For all participants, AVG significantly increased HR, VO2, and EE measures above rest, with significant between-activity differences. Responses were similar between YP and OP, except that the activities were more intense for OP, in terms of %HRR and RPE. Most games elicited responses consistent with light-intensity PA, though peak HR and VO2 values for aerobic and strength games met or approached recommended PA intensities. Wii FitTM appears to provide an enjoyable form of light PA for both YP and OP, which can reduce inactive screen time and provide beneficial cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and metabolic stimulation.",pmid,27182377,pubmed,International journal of exercise science,"Mullins, Nicole M; Tessmer, Kathryn A; McCarroll, Michele L; Peppel, Brian P",2017,NA,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Physiology Of Soccer: An Update.,"Soccer is the most popular sport in the world and is performed by men and women, children and adults with different levels of expertise. Soccer performance depends upon a myriad of factors such as technical/biomechanical, tactical, mental and physiological areas. One of the reasons that soccer is so popular worldwide is that players may not need to have an extraordinary capacity within any of these performance areas, but possess a reasonable level within all areas. However, there are trends towards more systematic training and selection influencing the anthropometric profiles of players who compete at the highest level. As with other activities, soccer is not a science, but science may help improve performance. Efforts to improve soccer performance often focus on technique and tactics at the expense of physical fitness. During a 90-minute game, elite-level players run about 10 km at an average intensity close to the anaerobic threshold (80-90% of maximal heart rate). Within this endurance context, numerous explosive bursts of activity are required, including jumping, kicking, tackling, turning, sprinting, changing pace, and sustaining forceful contractions to maintain balance and control of the ball against defensive pressure. The best teams continue to increase their physical capacities, whilst the less well ranked have similar values as reported 30 years ago. Whether this is a result of fewer assessments and training resources, selling the best players, and/or knowledge of how to perform effective exercise training regimens in less well ranked teams, is not known. As there do exist teams from lower divisions with as high aerobic capacity as professional teams, the latter factor probably plays an important role. This article provides an update on the physiology of soccer players and referees, and relevant physiological tests. It also gives examples of effective strength- and endurance-training programmes to improve on-field performance. The cited literature has been accumulated by computer searching of relevant databases and a review of the authors' extensive files. From a total of 9893 papers covering topics discussed in this article, 843 were selected for closer scrutiny, excluding studies where information was redundant, insufficient or the experimental design was inadequate. In this article, 181 were selected and discussed. The information may have important implications for the safety and success of soccer players and hopefully it should be understood and acted upon by coaches and individual soccer players.",pmid,15974635,pubmed,"Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)","Stølen, Tomas; Chamari, Karim; Castagna, Carlo; Wisløff, Ulrik",2005,NA,NA,reviewer1,Tamas

Data from Samoan children were compared with previously collected data from children (both black and white) residing in the continental United States. Samoan and black children demonstrated similar blood pressure reactivity (both absolute and delta values; P > .05); Samoans and blacks demonstrated greater blood pressure reactivity than whites (P < .05). Ethnic differences in heart rate reactivity were not as pronounced. After we adjusted reactivity values for ethnic differences in age, Quetelet index, and resting measurements, Samoans' reactivity continued to be more similar to the reactivity of blacks than that of whites. Results provide further evidence of ethnic differences in children's pressor reactivity; these differences may be related to differences in hypertension in adulthood.",pmid,7742732,Scopus,Ethnicity & disease,"Murphy J.K., McGarvey S.T.",1994,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Prevalence Of Overweight In High School Students With Special Reference To Cardiovascular Efficiency.,"In India, malnutrition has two ends. Under nutrition attracted the focus of health workers, as it is more prevalent. But over the past few years, childhood obesity is increasingly being observed with the changing lifestyle of families with increased purchasing power, increasing hours of inactivity due to television, video games and computers have replaced outdoor games and other social activities. Globally, an estimated 10% of school-aged children, between 5 and 17 years of age, are overweight and obese. Obesity can be seen as first wave of a defined cluster of non-communicable diseases called ""New World Syndrome"" creating an enormous socio-economic and public health burden in poorer countries. The most important consequence of childhood obesity is its persistence into adulthood with all its health risks like dyslipidemia, hyper-insulinemia, cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, osteoarthritis, gall bladder disease, hypertension and some sex hormone- sensitive cancers. The present study was, therefore, undertaken to determine the prevalence of overweight in high school students and to study the association between Body Mass Index (BMI) and cardiovascular efficiency. A school based cross sectional study was conducted in 2 schools of Nagpur. The total number of students included in the study was 565. Student's complete information regarding profile was taken in pretested questionnaire format after taking informed consent of parents. The anthropometric measurements of the students were done. Student's height and weight were measured and BMI was calculated. The student's cardiovascular efficiency was assessed with the help of Harvard step test. The data was analyzed using Epi info version 3.4.1 software. Chi-square test was used as test of significance and p value less than 0.05 was considered as significant. 90.97% students belonged to 13, 14 and 15 years of age group. majority of the students belong to 14 years (33.81), followed by 13 years (33.27) and 15 years (23.89) of age group respectively. The prevalence of overweight in students was 5.84% and obesity was 0.35%. The combined prevalence of overweight and obesity was 6.19%. The prevalence of overweight in boys is 5.31% and obesity was 0.63% and that in girls is 6.53% and 0% respectively. The association between Harvard step test and overweight was found to be statistically significant (p&lt; 0.000001). The total prevalence of overweight and obesity was 6.19%. The association between Harvard step test and overweight was found to be statistically significant (p&lt; 0.000001).",pmid,22980162,Scopus,Global journal of health science,"Deoke A., Hajare S., Saoji A.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Recognition Of Physical Activities In Overweight Hispanic Youth Using Knowme Networks,"Background: KNOWME Networks is a wireless body area network with 2 triaxial accelerometers, a heart rate monitor, and mobile phone that acts as the data collection hub. One function of KNOWME Networks is to detect physical activity (PA) in overweight Hispanic youth. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the in-laboratory recognition accuracy of KNOWME. Methods: Twenty overweight Hispanic participants (10 males; age 14.6 ± 1.8 years), underwent 4 data collection sessions consisting of 9 activities/session: lying down, sitting, sitting fidgeting, standing, standing fidgeting, standing playing an active video game, slow walking, brisk walking, and running. Data were used to train activity recognition models. The accuracy of personalized and generalized models is reported. Results: Overall accuracy for personalized models was 84%. The most accurately detected activity was running (96%). The models had difficulty distinguishing between the static and fidgeting categories of sitting and standing. When static and fidgeting activity categories were collapsed, the overall accuracy improved to 94%. Personalized models demonstrated higher accuracy than generalized models. Conclusions: KNOWME Networks can accurately detect a range of activities. KNOWME has the ability to collect and process data in real-time, building the foundation for tailored, real-time interventions to increase PA or decrease sedentary time. © 2012 Human Kinetics, Inc.",pmid,21934162,Scopus,Journal of Physical Activity and Health,"Emken B.A., Li M., Thatte G., Lee S., Annavaram M., Mitra U., Narayanan S., Spruijt-Metz D.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,"Relationships Among Socioeconomic Status, Stress Induced Changes In Cortisol, And Blood Pressure In African American Males","The inverse relation between socioeconomic status (SES) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk has been posited to be partially due to exaggerated cardiovascular reactivity (CVR) to stress. Stress elicits hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation (e.g., increased cortisol secretion), which may contribute to subsequent blood pressure (BP) elevation. Univariate associations among SES, cortisol secretion, and aggregated change scores to stressors (i.e., video game and forehead cold) for systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) were assessed in a sample of 24 African American males (M age = 18.8, ± 2.7 years). Circadian variability of cortisol level was taken into account by partialling out collection time. Family SES was inversely related to initial cortisol level (partial r = -.46, p < .03). Neighborhood SES was inversely related to DBP reactivity (r = -.41, p < .05). The change in cortisol level during the stressor protocol was related to SBP reactivity (partial r = .44, p < .05). These results suggest that SES may be linked to CVD via BP and cortisol reactivity to stress, but prospective studies are needed to clarify whether such is the case.",pmid,12434943,Scopus,Annals of Behavioral Medicine,"Kapuku G.K., Treiber F.A., Davis H.C.",2002,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas

This study was performed to investigate whether using PCs in PC game rooms may induce MSDs of the upper limbs. 284 young male Koreans were included. A self-administered, structured questionnaire was used to gather information about game room use, perceived subjective stress, and the symptoms related to MSDs. Urinary concentrations of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine were measured in spot urine. The symptom prevalence of MSDs of the upper limbs increased according to the increase of the duration of game room use. The intensity of perceived subjective stress showed a significant dose-response relationship with the frequency of MSDs symptoms in neck and shoulder areas. However, the urinary level of catecholamines was not significantly correlated with the symptom prevalence of MSDs in the upper limbs. These findings suggest that using PCs in game rooms produce physical stress on the upper limbs, strong enough to induce MSDs.",pmid,12808332,Scopus,Journal of Korean Medical Science,"Kang J.-W., Kim H., Cho S.-H., Lee M.-K., Kim Y.-D., Nan H.-M., Lee C.-H.",2003,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas

On another day, in a randomized order, the participants played Wii Boxing, Kinect Boxing, and Move Gladiatorial Combat while heart rate, ventilation, and oxygen consumption were measured. There were no differences in heart rate (116.0 ± 18.3 vs. 119.3 ± 17.6 vs. 120.1 ± 17.6 beats/min), oxygen consumption (9.2 ± 3.0 vs. 10.6 ± 2.4 vs. 9.6 ± 2.4 ml/kg/min), or minute ventilation (18.9 ± 5.7 vs. 20.8 ± 8.0 vs. 19.7 ± 6.4 L/min) when playing Wii boxing, Kinect boxing, or Move Gladiatorial Combat (respectively). Playing Nintendo Wii Boxing, XBOX Kinect Boxing, and Sony PlayStation Move Gladiatorial Combat all increase heart rate, oxygen consumption, and ventilation above resting levels but there were no significant differences between gaming systems.

,A Game Strategy For Power Flow Control Of Distributed Generators In Smart Grids,"We consider the distributed power control problem of distributed generators(DGs) in smart grid. In order to ensure the aggregated power output level to be desirable, a group of DGs with local and directed communications are expected to operate at the specified same ratio of their maximal available power output. To that end, the non-cooperative game is introduced and the DGs are modeled as self-interested game players. A new game model, termed state based weakly acyclic game, is developed to specify decision making architecture for each DGs, and at the point of the equilibrium of the game, the global objective of the power control problem can be achieved through autonomous DGs that are capable of making rational decisions to optimize their own payoff functions based on the local and directed information from other DGs. The validness of the proposed methodology is verified in simulation. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.",eid,2-s2.0-84908508640,Scopus,Communications in Computer and Information Science,"Zhang J., Qi D., Zhang G., Zhao G.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,A Peer-To-Peer Advertising Game,"Advertising plays a key role in service oriented recommendation over a peer-to-peer network. The advertising problem can be considered as the problem of finding a common language to denote the peers' capabilities and needs. Up to now the current approaches to the problem of advertising revealed that the proposed solutions either affect the autonomy assumption or do not scale up the size of the network. We explain how an approach based on language games can be effective in dealing with the typical issue of advertising: do not require ex-ante agreement and to be responsive to the evolution of the network as an open system. In the paper we introduce the notion of advertising game, a specific language game designed to deal with the issue of supporting the emergence of a common denotation language over a network of peers. We provide the related computational model and an experimental evaluation. A positive empirical evidence is achieved by sketching a peer-to-peer recommendation service for bookmark exchanging using real data. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.",eid,2-s2.0-35248841994,Scopus,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),"Avesani P., Agostini A.",2003,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,A Reactive Behavior Agent: Including Emotions Into A Video Game,"Why we have emotions and how they influence human behavior are two questions we constantly ask ourselves. According to researchers in the field, there are two kinds of information that the person receives to make a decision. This information is integrated to generate a whole. One comes from ourselves it is proprioceptive and refers to emotions; the other one is external, it comes from the environment. Thus, emotions are immersed in different areas of a person's life, including social, functional, and cognitive aspects. It has an important role in the decision-making process. It is on this last point that this paper focuses its approach, which consists of including a cognitive structure of emotions in a reactive behavior in order to enrich behavior, including the information generated through internal evaluation of the external physical stimuli. Our work is based on the OCC theory (named after the name of its authors: Ortony, Collins and Clore). This theory proposes that a decision-making process is affected through different perspectives: a) goals and events, b) agents and their actions, and c) objects and their capacity for attraction. The case study is situated within a scenario that represents an approach that seeks to include a module of emotions within the design of the architecture of a videogame.",eid,2-s2.0-84901349240,Scopus,Journal of Applied Research and Technology,"Laureano-Cruces A.L., Acevedo-Moreno D.A., Mora-Torres M., Ramírez-Rodríguez J.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,An Analysis Of The Insertion Of Virtual Players In Gmabs Methodology Using The Vip-Jogoman Prototype,"The GMABS (Games and Multi-Agent-Based Simulation) methodology was created from the integration of RPG and MABS techniques. This methodology links the dynamic capacity of MABS (Multi-Agent-Based Simulation) and the discussion and learning capacity of RPG (Role-Playing Games). Using GMABS, we have developed two prototypes in the natural resources management domain. The first prototype, called JogoMan (Adamatti et. al, 2005), is a paper-based game: all players need to be physically present in the same place and time, and there is a minimum needed number of participants to play the game. In order to avoid this constraint, we have built a second prototype, called ViP-JogoMan (Adamatti et. al, 2007), which is an extension of the first one. This second game enables the insertion of virtual players that can substitute some real players in the game. These virtual players can partially mime real behaviors and capture autonomy, social abilities, reaction and adaptation of the real players. We have chosen the BDI architecture to model these virtual players, since its paradigm is based on folk psychology; hence, its core concepts easily map the language that people use to describe their reasoning and actions in everyday life. ViP-JogoMan is a computer-based game, in which people play via Web, players can be in different places and it does not have a hard constraint regarding the minimum number of real players. Our aim in this paper is to present some test results obtained with both prototypes, as well as to present a preliminary discussion on how the insertion of virtual players has affected the game results. © JASSS.",eid,2-s2.0-68349104328,Scopus,JASSS,"Adamatti D.F., Sichman J.S., Coelho H.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Asynchronous Parallel Programming Language Based On The Microsoft.net Platform,"MC# is a programming language for cluster- and GRID-architectures based on asynchronous parallel programming model accepted in Polyphonic C# language (N.Benton, L.Cardelli, C.Fournet; Microsoft Research, Cambridge, UK). Asynchronous methods of Polyphonic C# play two major roles in MC#: 1) as autonomous methods executed on remote machines, and 2) as methods used for delivering messages. The former are identified in MC# as the ""movable methods"", and the latter form a special syntactic class with the elements named ""channels"". Similar to Polyphonic C#, chords are used for defining the channels and as a synchronization mechanism. The MC# channels are generalised naturally to ""bidirectional channels"", which may be used both for sending and receiving messages in the movable methods. The runtime-system of MC# has as the basic operation a copying operation for the object which is scheduled for execution on remote machine. This copy is ""dead"" after the movable method has finished its work, and all changes of this remote copy are not transferred to the original object. Arguments of the movable method are copied together with an original object, but the passing of bidirectional channels is realised through transferring the proxies for such channels. By way of experiments in MC#, we have written a series of parallel programs such as a computation of Fibonacci numbers, walking through binary tree, computation of primes by Eratosthenes sieve, calculation of Mandelbrot set, modeling the Conway's game ""Life"", etc. In all these cases, we got the easy readable and compact code. Also we have an experimental implementation in which the compiler is written in SML.NET, and the execution of movable methods on remote machines is based on the Reflection library of .NET platform. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.",eid,2-s2.0-35248888629,Scopus,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),"Guzev V., Serdyuk Y.",2003,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Authenticity In The Age Of Digital Companions,"The first generation of children to grow up with electronic toys and games saw computers as their ""nearest neighbors."" They spoke of computers as rational machines and of people as emotional machines, a fragile formulation destined to be challenged. By the mid- 1990s, computational creatures, including robots, were presenting themselves as ""relational artifacts,"" beings with feelings and needs. One consequence of this development is a crisis in authenticity in many quarters. In an increasing number of situations, people behave as though they no longer privilege authentic emotion. This paper examines watershed moments in the history of human-machine interaction, focusing on the implications of relational artifacts for our collective perception of aliveness and for human-to-human relationships. For now, the exploration of human-robot encounters leads us to questions about the human purposes of believable digital companions that are evocative but not authentic. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.",eid,2-s2.0-39049140285,Scopus,Interaction Studies,Turkle S.,2007,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas

,"Computer/Gaming Station Use In Youth: Correlations Among Use, Addiction And Functional Impairment","Objective: Computer/gaming station use is ubiquitous in the lives of youth today. Overuse is a concern, but it remains unclear whether problems arise from addictive patterns of use or simply excessive time spent on use. The goal of the present study was to evaluate computer/gaming station use in youth and to examine the relationship between amounts of use, addictive features of use and functional impairment. Method: A total of 110 subjects (11 to 17 years of age) from local schools participated. Time spent on television, video gaming and nongaming recreational computer activities was measured. Addictive features of computer/gaming station use were ascertained, along with emotional/behavioural functioning. Multiple linear regressions were used to understand how youth functioning varied with time of use and addictive features of use. Results: Mean (± SD) total screen time was 4.5±2.4 h/day. Addictive features of use were consistently correlated with functional impairment across multiple measures and informants, whereas time of use, after controlling for addiction, was not. Conclusions: Youth are spending many hours each day in front of screens. In the absence of addictive features of computer/gaming station use, time spent is not correlated with problems; however, youth with addictive features of use show evidence of poor emotional/behavioural functioning. ©2012 Pulsus Group Inc.

,Educational Computer Games And Their Application To Developmental Disabilities,"Most children enjoy playing computer games. This makes computer technology ideal for educational applications, as intrinsic motivation for learning is built into the game. Considering that nowadays most children spend quite a bit of their waking hours in front of a computer, it is clearly desirable to make computer games as educational as possible. These considerations hold generally true for children with typical development as well as for children with developmental disabilities or with mental impairments. There is quite a long history of the use of computers in educational settings, including special education, but the explosive growth of rapidly evolving computer technology plus recent findings from research in education and in developmental disabilities make computers an ever more promising, appropriate, and powerful tool in any learning environment today. Modern educational computer games have several immense advantages: Considering that most families have access to a computer, these games are inexpensive, widely distributable, and easily accessible for most families, largely independent of economic status (i.e., ""democratization of learning opportunities""). They may reduce the need for costly one-on-one professional tutoring. These games can be designed to be fun and dynamic. Perhaps most importantly, computer games can be custom-designed to adjust in ""real time"" and ""on-line"" to the player's individual characteristics, whether those are strengths or weaknesses. Most recently, we designed a simple computer game that can be enjoyed and played successfully by low-functioning children with autism and has been shown to be useful in assessing the child's individual attention patterns in language perception. The game is also designed such that in the future attention to general visual and auditory information can be assessed. With this approach, for example, synchronicity of facial expression and emotional tone in language can be assessed. Perception of both language and emotions are known to be problematic for many children with autism. Future development aims at building in features that allow the computer to monitor the child's individual attention patterns, adjust to them, and then implement attentionshaping methods to remediate any deficits. A general application will be to help focus and expand the attention span of children with autism and with attention deficit disorder. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

,Entertainment Feature Of A Computer Game Using A Biological Signal To Realize A Battle With Oneself,"A novel computer game was developed in which a player challenges him- or herself using the skin conductance response to make the player aware of his or her own agitation. This game was developed as a paradoxical system in which their desire to win makes it more difficult to win. This type of game was found to have the following characteristics. First, players find uncontrollable themselves due to viewing their biological signals. In this situation, a kind of self-reference system is constructed. Second, the environments changed how the game was enjoyed. Third, the game system reveals differences of context between player and observer. From these characteristics, it is thought that the use of biological signals is attractive for entertainment computing. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2004.",eid,2-s2.0-33646191844,Scopus,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),"Sakurazawa S., Munekata N., Yoshida N., Tsukahara Y., Matsubara H.",2004,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Exploring Emergence In Simple Agent-Based Models,"This work examines the concept of emergence in agent-based modelling and simulation by modelling several types of agent-based systems and examining simulations for potential emergent phenomena. Emergent phenomena are considered as either emergent behaviour or emergent strategy. Initially, the Netlogo platform is used to develop a rudimentary agent-based model upon which incremental and systematic changes in agent behaviour rules are imposed to examine the points at which emergent behaviour may be detected. Emergent behaviour is defined as agent- and/or group-level phenomena that are not specifically encoded by the modeller. While emergence may be a behavioural whole of the system that is greater than the sum of its parts, it may manifest at large or small scales, may be a complex or a simple phenomenon, and may be counterintuitive or not. Emergent behaviour begins when the outcomes of a simulation cannot be expressly tied back to the encoded individual agent behavioural rules and profiles. In the second part of this work, an in-house platform is used to explore emergent strategy. Emergent strategy is the view that strategy emerges over time as agents' intentions collide with and accommodate a changing reality. Emergent strategy is a set of actions consistent over time, or a realized pattern which was not expressly intended in the original planning of strategy, i.e., a form of learning that emergences from practice. © 2017 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",eid,2-s2.0-85019596129,Scopus,Advances in Engineering Research,"Friesen M.R., Leduc-McNiven K., Ferens K., Jeffrey I., McLeod R.D.",2017,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Exploring Interrelationships Among High School Students’ Engagement Factors In Introductory Programming Courses Via A 3D Multi-User Serious Game Created In Open Sim,"The technological affordances of three-dimensional (3D) multi-user virtual worlds and their effectiveness in task-based learning approaches are to a large extent well-established in the international field of computer literacy research. However, less attention was given to their positive or negative impact on student engagement. The current study seeks to investigate the interrelationships of students’ engagement among multidimensional constructs consisting of cognitive, emotional and behavioral factors in order to understand better the educational community the learning effectiveness emerged through a 3D computer-supported and multiuser serious game created for introductory programming courses. An instructional design framework based on Papert’s theory of Constructionism to be amplified the students’ activities and management of their interactions in a 3D multi-user serious game created via an Open Sim standalone server integrated with Scratch4OS is also proposed. Fifty-five (n=55) voluntary students from three different high schools participated and experienced in a 3D mind-trap puzzle game named Co.Co.I.A. (Collaborative Construction of Interactive Artifacts) to learn basic programming structures. The empirical study findings indicated that student behavioral engagement (attention, retention and energy expenditure for activity completion) had not only a linear correlation with cognitive engagement (learning strategies for the construction of the knowledge domain), but it had also a positive association with emotional engagement (students’ positive emotions and achievement orientation) in collaborative learning tasks, causing the reinforcement of the other two factors as well. © J.UCS.",eid,2-s2.0-84920050637,Scopus,Journal of Universal Computer Science,Pellas N.,2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,How Can An Agent Learn To Negotiate?,"Negotiation has been extensively discussed in game-theoretic, economic, and management science literatures for decades. Recent growing interest in autonomous interacting software agents and their potential application in areas such as electronic commerce has given increased importance to automated negotiation. Evidence both from theoretical analysis and from observations of human interactions suggests that if decision makers can somehow take into consideration what other agents are thinking and furthermore learn during their interactions how other agents behave, their payoff might increase. In this paper, we propose a sequential decision making model of negotiation, called Bazaar. It provides an adaptive, multi-issue negotiation model capable of exhibiting a rich set of negotiation behaviors. Within the proposed negotiation framework, we model learning as a Bayesian belief update process. We prove that under certain conditions learning is indeed beneficial. © 2015, Lecture Notes in Computer Science.

,Humans Deceived By Predatory Stealth Strategy Camouflaging Motion,"Motion camouflage is a stealth strategy that allows a predator to conceal its apparent motion as it approaches a moving prey. Although male hoverflies have been observed to move in a manner consistent with motion camouflage to track females, the successful application of the technique has not previously been demonstrated. This article describes the implementation and results of a psychophysical experiment suggesting that humans are susceptible to motion camouflage. The experiment masqueraded as a computer-game competition. The basis of the competition was a game designed to test the comparative success of different predatory-approach strategies. The experiment showed that predators were able to approach closer to their prey (the player of the game) before being detected when using motion camouflage than when using other approach strategies tested. For an autonomous predator, the calculation of a motion-camouflage approach is a non-trivial problem. It was, therefore, of particular interest that in the game the players were deceived by motion-camouflage predators controlled by artificial neural systems operating using realistic levels of input information. It is suggested that these results are especially of interest to biologists, visual psychophysicists, military engineers and computer-games designers.",eid,2-s2.0-0041529639,Scopus,Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences,"Anderson A.J., McOwan P.W.",2003,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas

,Learning In Real-Time Search: A Unifying Framework,"Real-time search methods are suited for tasks in which the agent is interacting with an initially unknown environment in real time. In such simultaneous planning and learning problems, the agent has to select its actions in a limited amount of time, while sensing only a local part of the environment centered at the agent's current location. Real-time heuristic search agents select actions using a limited lookahead search and evaluating the frontier states with a heuristic function. Over repeated experiences, they refine heuristic values of states to avoid infinite loops and to converge to better solutions. The wide spread of such settings in autonomous software and hardware agents has led to an explosion of real-time search algorithms over the last two decades. Not only is a potential user confronted with a hodgepodge of algorithms, but he also faces the choice of control parameters they use. In this paper we address both problems. The first contribution is an introduction of a simple three-parameter framework (named LRTS) which extracts the core ideas behind many existing algorithms. We then prove that LRTA*, ε-LRTA*, SLA*, and γ-Trap algorithms are special cases of our framework. Thus, they are unified and extended with additional features. Second, we prove completeness and convergence of any algorithm covered by the LRTS framework. Third, we prove several upper-bounds relating the control parameters and solution quality. Finally, we analyze the influence of the three control parameters empirically in the realistic scalable domains of real-time navigation on initially unknown maps from a commercial role-playing game as well as routing in ad hoc sensor networks. © 2006 AI Access Foundation.

,Multi-Modal Emotional Database: Avid,This paper presents our work on recording a multi-modal database containing emotional audio and video recordings. In designing the recording strategies a special attention was payed to gather data involving spontaneous emotions and therefore obtain a more realistic training and testing conditions for experiments. With specially planned scenarios including playing computer games and conducting an adaptive intelligence test different levels of arousal were induced. This will enable us to both detect different emotional states as well as experiment in speaker identification/verification of people involved in communications. So far the multi-modal database has been recorded and basic evaluation of the data was processed.,eid,2-s2.0-64249151844,Scopus,Informatica (Ljubljana),"Gajšek R., Štruc V., Mihelič F., Podlesek A., Komidar L., Sočan G., Bajec B.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,Optimal Guidance Of A Relay Aircraft To Extend Small Unmanned Aircraft Range,"This paper developed guidance laws to optimally and autonomously position a relay Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) to provide an operator with real-time Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) by relaying communication and video signals from a rover MAV to the base, thus extending the rover's reach. The ISR system is comprised of two MAVs, the Relay and the Rover, and a Base. The Relay strives to position itself so as to minimize the radio frequency (RF) power required for maintaining communications between the Rover and the Base, while the Rover performs the ISR mission, which may maximize the required RF power. The optimal control of the Relay MAV then entails the solution of a differential game. Applying Pontryagin's Maximum Principle yields a standard, albeit nonlinear, Two-Point Boundary Value Problem (TPBVP). Suboptimal solutions are first obtained as an aid in solving the TPBVP which yields the solution of the differential game. One suboptimal approach is based upon the geometry of the ISR system: The midpoint between the Rover and the Base is the ideal location which minimizes the RF power required, so the Relay heads toward that point-assuming that the Rover is stationary. At the same time, to maximize the rate of required RF power, the Rover moves in the opposite direction of the Relay-assuming the Relay is stationary. These are optimal strategies in the end-game, but it is suboptimal to use them throughout the game. Another suboptimal approach investigated envisions the Rover to remain stationary and solves for the optimal path for the Relay to minimize the RF power requirement. This one-sided optimization problem is analyzed using a Matlab-based optimization program, GPOCS, which uses the Gauss pseudospectral method of discretization. The results from GPOCS corroborated with the geometry-based suboptimal Relay strategy of heading straight toward the midpoint between the Rover and the Base. The suboptimal solutions are readily implementable for real-time operation and are used to facilitate the solutions of the TPBVP.",eid,2-s2.0-84985963210,Scopus,International Journal of Micro Air Vehicles,"Pachter M., Hansen J., Jacques D., Blue P.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas

,"Technology Use In Promoting Effective Emotion-Regulation: Applications In Workplace, Parenting And For Children","There is growing research showing that effective emotion-regulation is related to various adaptive outcomes in both adults and children. Recent technological advances are offering important resources for being used in testing the effects of emotion-regulation and equipping people with effective emotion-regulation skills. In this chapter we present the state of the art in the use of technology for investigating the effects of various emotion-regulation strategies. We refer to the robotic, virtual reality, computer-based, mobile, and online modalities for promoting effective emotion-regulation strategies and their applications in the workplace, parenting and child mental health domains. We make the case that technology-based delivery of the emotion-regulation strategies have the chance to be more accessible and successfully implemented in a setting characterized by rapid technological integration, like the work setting. Also, technology is a preferred means for children, population in which the experimental investigation of emotion-regulation strategies is not strong enough.

,The Effectiveness Of Casual Video Games In Improving Mood And Decreasing Stress,"Stress related medical disorders such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and depression are serious medical issues that can cause disability and death. Techniques to prevent their development and exacerbation are needed. Casual video games (CVGs) are fun, easy to play, spontaneous and are tremendously popular. In this randomized controlled study we tested the effects of CVGs on mood and stress by comparing people playing CVGs with control subjects under similar conditions. Electroencephalography (EEG) changes during game play were consistent with increased mood and corroborated findings on psychological reports. Moreover, heart rate variability (HRV) changes were consistent with autonomic nervous system relaxation or decreased physical stress. In some cases CVGs produced different brain wave, heart rate variability and psychological effects. These finding have broad implications which include the potential development of prescriptive interventions using casual video games to prevent and treat stress related medical disorders. © Virtual Reality Medical Institute.",eid,2-s2.0-77956912218,Scopus,Journal of Cyber Therapy and Rehabilitation,"Russoniello C.V., O'Brien K., Parks J.M.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,The Effects Of Aerobic Fitness On Additional Heart Rates During Active Psychological Challenge,"Heart rate (HR), oxygen consumption (VO2) and blood pressure were recorded while 24 young males performed two active psychological challenges, mental arithmetic and a video game, and undertook graded dynamic exercise. On the basis of estimated VO2 max. values derived from the exercise data, subjects were divided into high fit (HF) and low fit (LF) groups. All physiological measures changed in response to psychological challenge, and during exercise (with the exception of diastolic blood pressure), increased as an orderly function of workload. During both exercise and psychological challenge, HF subjects showed similar VO2 values but lower HR values than the LF subjects. Additional HR values were then calculated. For each subjects, HR was plotted against VO2 over the various workloads of the graded exercise task. These regressions were then used in conjunction with VO2 values during the psychological challenges to predict expected HR values during these tasks. The predicted values were significantly lower overall for both tasks than the values actually recorded. Additional HR values were computed for each subject for each task as actual HR minus predicted HR. The HF group displayed significantly less additional HR during both task periods than did the LF group.

,"The Effects Of Fifa 2015 Computer Games On Changes In Cognitive, Hormonal And Brain Waves Functions Of Young Men Volunteers","Introduction: Computer games have attracted remarkable attentions in general publics with different cultures and their effects are subject of research by cognitive neuroscientists. In the present study, possible effects of the game Fifa 2015 on cognitive performance, hormonal levels, and electroencephalographic (EEG) signals were evaluated in young male volunteers. Methods: Thirty two subjects aged 20 years on average participated mutually in playing computer game Fifa 2015. Identification information and general knowledge about the game were collected. Saliva samples from the contestants were obtained before and after the competition. Perceptive and cognitive performance including the general cognitive health, response delay, attention maintenance, and mental fatigue were measured using PASAT test. EEG were recorded during the play using EEG device and analyzed later using QEEG. Simultaneously, the players' behavior were recorded using a video camera. Saliva cortisol levels were assessed by ELISA kit. Data were analyzed by SPSS program. Results: The impact of playing computer games on cortisol concentration of saliva before and after the game showed that the amount of saliva plasma after playing the game has dropped significantly. Also the impact of playing computer games on mental health, before and after the game indicated that the number of correct answers has not changed significantly. This indicates that sustained attention has increased in participants after the game in comparison with before that. Also it is shown that mental fatigue measured by PASAT test, did not changed significantly after the game in comparison to before that. The impact of game on changes in brain waves showed that the subjects in high activity state during playing the game had higher power of the EEG signals in most of the channels in lower frequency bands in compared to normal state. Discussion: The present study showed that computer games can positively affect the stress system and the perceptual-cognitive system. Even though this impact was not significant in most cases, the changes in cognitive and hormonal test and also in brain waves were visible. Hence, due to the importance of this matter, it is necessary to create control systems in selecting the types of games for playing.",eid,2-s2.0-84937216083,Scopus,Basic and Clinical Neuroscience,"Aliyari H., Kazemi M., Tekieh E., Salehi M., Sahraei H., Daliri M.R., Agaei H., Minaei-Bidgoli B., Lashgari R., Srahian N., Hadipour M.M., Salehi M., Aghdam A.R.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Tamas

,Treatment Efficiency Of Heat-Sensitive Moxibustion Affiliation In Children With Unilateral Hyperopic Anisometropic Amblyopia,"Objective: This study aims to investigate the efficacy of Heat-sensitive moxibustion affiliation treatment for unilateral hyperopic anisometropic amblyopia. Methods: 92 children (aged from 8 a to 14 a) diagnosed as unilateral hyperopic anisometropic amblyopia in the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University from 2007 to 2013 were include in this prospective random controlled study. All patients were divided into three groups and treated with different therapeutic method: occlusion (group A), combination of occlusion and video game (group B), and combination of occlusion, video game and heat-sensitive moxibustion (group C). After 60 days treatment, all cases were received therapy with red light flicker, luster, light brush for 120 days at home. All treatments were finished until 180 days later. In addition, visual acuity assay and visual evoked potentials (VEP) were used in all case at pre-therapy and 20 d, 40 d, 60 d, 180 d of post-therapy during the period of treatment. Results: There were no significant differences in age, course and visual acuity in three groups (F=1.88, 0.82, 0.38; P>0.05). After 60 days treatment, the visual acuity of all case in three groups were increased. The BCVA (The best-corrected visual acuity) of patients in group B and group C were higher than that of patients in group A at every time point (P<0.05). After 180 days treatment, BCVA was improved from baseline by an average of 1.07 lines in the group A, 2.83 lines in the group B and 5.86 lines in the group C. Comparing with the latency of P100 of VEP elicited by reversing checkerboard with different spatial frequencies in case before treatment, the latency of P100 of VEP were shortened significantly in three groups at 180 d. Besides, the latency of P100 of VEP elicited in group C were less shorter than other case in group A and B [4 period/radian, t=11.62, P<0.05; 8 period/radian, t=9.68, P<0.05].

,A Bayesian Approach To Multiagent Reinforcement Learning And Coalition Formation Under Uncertainty,"Sequential decision making under uncertainty is always a challenge for autonomous agents populating a multiagent environment, since their behaviour is inevitably influenced by the behaviour of others. Further, agents have to constantly struggle to find the right balance between exploiting  current information regarding the environment and the rest of its inhabitants, and exploring so that they acquire additional information. Moreover, they need to profitably trade off short-term rewards with anticipated long-term ones, while learning through interaction about the environment and others—employing techniques from reinforcement learning (RL), a fundamental area of study within artificial intelligence (AI).  Coalition formation is a problem of great interest within game theory and AI, allowing autonomous individually rational agents to form stable or transient teams (or coalitions) to tackle an underlying task. Agents participating in realistic scenarios of repeated  coalition formation under uncertainty face the issues identified above, and need to bargain to succesfully negotiate the terms of their participation in coalitions—often having to compromise individual with team welfare effectively.    In this thesis, we provide theoretical and algorithmic tools to accommodate  sequential decision making under uncertainty in multiagent settings, dealing with the issues above. Specifically, we combine multiagent Bayesian RL with game theoretic ideas to facilitate the agents' sequential decision making. We deal with popular multiagent problems which were to date not tackled under uncertainty, or more specifically under type uncertainty.  In our work, we assume that the environment dynamics or the types (capabilities) of other agents are not known, and thus the agents have to account for this uncertainty, in a Bayesian way, when making decisions. Handling type uncertainty allows information about others acquired within one setting to be exploited in possibly different settings in the future.    The core of our contributions lies in the area of coalition formation under uncertainty. We studied several aspects of both the cooperative and non-cooperative facets of this problem, coining new theoretical concepts, proving theoretical results, presenting and evaluating algorithms for use in this context, and proposing a Bayesian RL framework for optimal repeated coalition formation under uncertainty.",pq_id,304762020,proquest_dt,NA,"Chalkiadakis, Georgios",2007,THES,Ph.D.,reviewer1,Tamas
,A Study Of Trust Development In Virtual Human-Agent Teamwork Without Explicit Coordination,"With the advancement in agent technology and social recognition and acceptance of autonomous online services we foresee increasing use of agents in social contexts and, in particular, in human-agent virtual and ad hoc team applications. For such virtual ad hoc teams, particularly those where explicit coordination to determine task allocations are infeasible due to communication and time constraints,  to be effective, agents need to quickly develop an understanding of the expectation of human team members and be able to quickly adapt accordingly. This dissertation  empirically investigates the effects of agent performance, past experience of humans, and agent reputation on human trust in and behavior towards agent teammates. We also study the differences in growth of humans' trust attitudes towards human and agent teammates during initial interactions while achieving team goals.    Ad hoc collaboration of humans and agents without pre-planning is a novel human-agent teamwork concept that enables diverse, high-impact applications including emergency response, group buying, online social movements, and next generation crowd-sourcing. In spite of prior work on the influence of various factors on human trust in automation, very little is known about human trust in ""peer"" agent teammates. This is the first study to investigate these factors in virtual human-agent teamwork without pre-planning or explicit coordination.    This dissertation introduces a repeated team coordination game, the Game of Trust (GoT), in which two players repeatedly cooperate to complete team tasks without prior assignment of subtasks. We systematically evaluate the effects of agent performance, past experience, and agent reputation on human trust in the GoT by performing an extensive set of controlled experiments with subjects recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk, a crowdsourcing Internet marketplace. We collect both teamwork performance data as well as surveys to gauge participants' trust in their agent partners. A learning agent player is developed by training on collected game data to predict future task choices of humans and is shown to increase social utility by reducing redundant work and increasing team goal achievement rates.    The empirical results indicate that participants were able to respond appropriately to changes in an agent's behavior in terms of trust and contributions to teamwork, that positive (negative) past experience and positive (negative) reputation increase (decrease) human trust in agent teammates, and humans' trust attitudes towards human and agent teammates differ. The results also show that past experience can affect three antecedents of trust: emotional state, game expertise, and expectation. The interplay between these three elements significantly affected the influence of agent performance and reputation on human trust. The detailed findings and the recommendations derived from them in this dissertation will allow agent developers to set appropriate context for more efficient and successful ad hoc collaboration between human and agent peers in virtual teams.    This dissertation enhances our understanding of the changes in human trust in peer level agent teammates with respect to agent trustworthiness, past experience, and agent reputation. The empirical findings provide clear and significant evidence of the influence of key factors on human trust in virtual agent teammates. We also derive several guidelines for agents to follow in practice.",pq_id,1807632181,proquest_dt,NA,"Hafizoglu, Feyza Merve",2015,THES,Ph.D.,reviewer1,Tamas
,Data-Driven Interaction Methods For Socially Assistive Robotics: Validation With Children With Autism Spectrum Disorders,"There exists a great untapped potential for the use of intelligent robots as therapeutic social partners for children. However, enabling a robot to understand social behavior, and do so while interacting with the child, is a challenging problem. Children are highly individual and thus technology used for social interaction requires recognition of a wide-range of social behavior. This argues for data-driven methods that capture the relevant range of interactions. This work addresses the challenge of designing data-driven behaviors for socially assistive robots in order to enable them to recognize and appropriately respond to a child's free-form behavior in unstructured play contexts. The focus on free-form behavior is inspired by and grounded in the DIR/Floortime approach to therapeutic intervention with children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). This approach emphasizes fostering engagement through play, recognizing social behavior and using ""engagements"" to bolster social interactions.    This research presents a data-driven methodology and a validated experimental framework for enabling fully autonomous robots to interact with both typically developing children and children with ASD in undirected scenarios using socially appropriate behavior, especially where spatial interaction is concerned. Autonomous robot operation as a critical aspect of the methodology; save for safety interventions by a human operator, the robot acts of its own accord. The robot and child engage in free-form interaction, in part though distance-oriented behaviors; the robot must be able to recognize the child's behaviors and respond to them appropriately. This dissertation presents the following computational contributions with therapeutic potential:    • Detection and mitigation of a child's distress: This work presents methodology for learning and then applying a data-driven spatio-temporal model of social behavior based on distance-based features to automatically differentiate between typical vs. aversive child-robot interactions. Using a Gaussian Mixture Model learned over distance-based feature data, the developed system is able to detect and interpret social behavior with sufficient accuracy to recognize child distress. The robot uses this model to change its own behavior so as to encourage positive social interaction.    • Encouragement of human-human and human-robot interaction: This work demonstrates a global and local motion planner that uses the above spatio-temporal model as part of the determination of a motion trajectory that maintains the robot's spatial relationship with the child and sustains interaction while also encouraging the child to move toward another proximal interaction partner. The desired spatial interaction behavior is achieved by modifying an established trajectory planner to weight candidate trajectories based on conformity to a trained model of the desired behavior.    • Data-Driven Approach For Providing Graded Cueing Feedback: A methodology for robot behavior that provides autonomous feedback for a robot-child imitation and turn-taking game. This is accomplished by incorporating an established therapeutic model of feedback along with a trained model of imitation behavior. This is used as part of an autonomous system that can play a turn-taking game, recognize breeches in imitation behavior, and interpret a breech in order to provide appropriate feedback. The approach is validated in a spatial imitation game, used to gauge the presence of imitation behavior.    The three main contributions above: averse behavior detection, model-based trajectory planning, and data-driven feedback, have been instantiated and validated in several SAR systems using autonomous person sensing, behavior interpretation, and action selection, for the purposes of detecting, provoking, and encouraging both human-human and human-robot social interaction. The validated systems were tested in experiments that evaluated the system design, the accuracy of the robot's ability to interpret observed behavior, the appropriateness of the robot's responses, and the quality of the child-robot and child-parent social behavior interaction. The evaluation experiments were conducted with both children with ASD and typically developing children. The systems were also used to explore the therapeutic potential of socially assistive robots facilitated by the developed models, architecture, and experiment framework.",pq_id,1027773421,proquest_dt,NA,"Feil-Seifer, David J.",2012,THES,Ph.D.,reviewer1,Tamas
,Economic Incentive Mechanisms For User-Contributed Wireless Networks,"User-contributed wireless networks are formed by wireless devices that are owned by different users. They have been widely used to achieve better connectivity at places where an infrastructure is not immediately available or cannot be directly used. The functioning of the user-contributed wireless network depends on the cooperation of the nodes in the network. In civilian wireless networks, nodes often belong to different users who have their own interests and always want to maximize their benefits. Consequently, the user nodes may not want to behave cooperatively, if it does not suit their needs and interests. Like many distributed autonomous systems, user-contributed wireless networks have the common incentive problems such as the free-rider problem, where only a small portion of user nodes contribute their resources, and the adverse selection problem, where user nodes do not reveal their states truthfully. So, to ensure the functioning of user-contributed wireless networks, it is highly important to provide incentives for nodes to cooperate. Game theory is a nature tool to deal with the problem of selfish behavior. In our work, we adopt solution concepts from game theory to study important incentive problems in user-contributed wireless networks. We mainly focus on two categories of incentive problems: routing problems and spectrum sharing problems. For routing, we have done four works. First, we considered the traditional deterministic routing in user-contributed wireless ad hoc networks, and proposed a mechanism to prevent the user nodes from colluding. Second, we studied the incentive issues for opportunistic routing in user-contributed wireless mesh networks, and proposed mechanisms to stimulate nodes to truthfully reveal their link states, so that the most efficient routing decision can be reached. Third, we proposed the first bargaining-based incentive mechanism for probabilistic routing that stimulates selfish nodes to participate in message forwarding. Fourth, we proposed a strategy-proof mechanism to efficiently distribute data flows among node-disjoint paths obtained by multipath routing protocols. For spectrum sharing, we studied multi-radio multi-channel assignment problem in a single collision domain, and proposed an incentive mechanism to ensure the system converge to equilibrium, named strongly dominant strategy equilibrium. At the same time, this equilibrium state achieves optimal system throughput.",pq_id,305084774,proquest_dt,NA,"Wu, Fan",2009,THES,Ph.D.,reviewer1,Tamas
,Edge Indexing In A Grid For Highly Dynamic Virtual Environments,"Newly emerging game-based application systems provide three-dimensional virtual environments where multiple users interact with each other in real-time. They are filled with autonomous, mutable virtual content which is continuously augmented by the users. To make the systems highly scalable and dynamically extensible, they are usually built on a client-server based grid subspace division where the virtual worlds are partitioned into manageable sub-worlds. In each sub-world, the user continuously receives relevant geometry updates of moving objects from remotely connected servers and renders them according to her viewpoint, rather than retrieving them from a local storage medium.    In such systems, the determination of the set of objects that are visible from a user's viewpoint is one of the primary factors that affect server throughput and scalability. Specifically, performing real-time visibility tests in extremely dynamic virtual environments is a very challenging task as millions of objects and sub-millions of active users are moving and interacting. We recognize that the described challenges are closely related to a spatial database problem, and hence we map the moving geometry objects in the virtual space to a set of multi-dimensional objects in a spatial database while modeling each avatar both as a spatial object and a moving query. Unfortunately, existing spatial indexing methods are unsuitable for this kind of new environments.    The main goal of this study is to present an efficient spatial index structure that minimizes unexpected object popping and supports highly scalable real-time visibility determination. We then uncover many useful properties of this structure and compare the index structure with various spatial indexing methods in terms of query quality, system throughput, and resource utilization. We expect our approach to lay the groundwork for next-generation virtual frameworks that may merge into existing web-based services in the near future.",pq_id,230863571,proquest_dt,NA,"Seo, Beomjoo",2008,THES,Ph.D.,reviewer1,Tamas
,Emotion Modelling With Human Belief Revision In Computer Games.,"Emotion modelling is receiving more and more attention from various fields, e.g. cognitive science, psychology, computer science and neuroscience. Most of these fields share the common research consensus that emotion can be beneficial to human's mental activities. This thesis is also grounded on the same consensus and makes further validations based on the following two hypotheses: One is emotional agents in games should behave more like human beings than emotionless agents; the other is that agents having full emotional architecture should obtain better playing performance than agents with only partial architecture. Based on theoretical support, the author further hypothesizes that peoples' long term belief can be one of the sources to release complex emotions. The experiment result suggests the emotional agents did perform significantly better than emotionless ones, but it was unable to significantly reflect the advantages from fully structured emotional agents over the ones of the partial architecture.",pq_id,33791611,proquest_dt,NA,"Ma, Yan",2007,THES,NA,reviewer1,Tamas

To counteract such issues, this thesis proposes a game theoretical replica placement framework, in which autonomous agents compete for the allocation or reallocation of replicas onto their representative servers in a self-managed fashion. Naturally, each agent's goal is to maximize its own benefit. However, the framework is designed to suppress individualism and to ensure system-wide optimization. Using this framework as an environment, several cooperative and non-cooperative low-complexity, flexible, and scalable game theoretical replica placement techniques are proposed, analytically investigated, and experimentally evaluated. Each of these techniques supports different game theoretical (pareto-optimality, catering to agents' interests, deliberate discrimination of allocation, budget balanced, pure Nash equilibrium, and Nash equilibrium) and system (link distance, congestion control, minimization of communication cost, and memory optimization) related properties. Using a detailed test-bed involving eighty various network topologies and two real-world access logs, each game theoretical technique is also extensively compared with conventional replica placement techniques, such as, greedy heuristics, branch-and-bound techniques and genetic algorithms. The experimental study confirms that in each case the proposed techniques outperform other conventional methods. The results can be summarized in four ways: (1) The number of replicas in a system self-adjusts to reflect the ratio of the number of reads versus writes access; (2) Performance is improved by replicating objects to the servers based on the locality of reference; (3) Replica allocations are made in a fast algorithmic turn-around time; (4) The complexity of the data replication problem is decreased by multifold.",pq_id,304708497,proquest_dt,NA,"Khan, Samee Ullah",2007,THES,Ph.D.,reviewer1,Tamas
,Mechanism Design And Analysis Using Simulation-Based Game Models,"As agent technology matures, it becomes easier to envision electronic marketplaces teeming with autonomous agents. Since agents are explicitly programmed to optimally compete in these marketplaces (within bounds of computational tractability), and markets themselves are designed with specific objectives in mind, tools are necessary for systematic analyses of strategic interactions among autonomous agents. While traditional game-theoretic approaches to the analysis of multi-agent systems can provide much insight, they are often inadequate, as they rely heavily on analytic tractability of the problem at hand; however, even mildly realistic models of electronic marketplaces contain enough complexity to render a fully analytic approach hopeless.    To address questions not amenable to traditional theoretical approaches, I develop methods that allow systematic computational analysis of game-theoretic models in which the players' payoff functions are represented using simulations (i.e., simulation-based games). I develop a globally convergent algorithm for Nash equilibrium approximation in infinite simulation-based games, which I instantiate in the context of infinite games of incomplete information. Additionally, I use statistical learning techniques to improve the quality of Nash equilibrium approximation based on data collected from a game simulator. I also derive probabilistic confidence bounds and present convergence results about solutions of finite games modeled using simulations. The former allow an analyst to make statistically-founded statements about results based on game-theoretic simulations, while the latter provide formal justification for approximating game-theoretic solutions using simulation experiments. To address the broader mechanism design problem, I introduce an iterative algorithm for search in the design space, which requires a game solver as a subroutine. As a result, I enable computational mechanism design using simulation-based models of games by availing the designer of a set of solution tools geared specifically towards games modeled using simulations.     I apply the developed computational techniques to analyze strategic procurement and answer design questions in a supply-chain simulation, as well as to analyze dynamic bidding strategies in sponsored search auctions. Indeed, the techniques I develop have broad potential applicability beyond electronic marketplaces; they are geared towards any system that features competing strategic players who respond to incentives in a way that can be reasonably predicted via a game-theoretic analysis.",pq_id,304575864,proquest_dt,NA,"Vorobeychik, Yevgeniy",2008,THES,Ph.D.,reviewer1,Tamas

,Effects Of Videogame Play In Boys: An Examination Of Adrenocortical Activity And Behavior.,"Abstract: This study sought to extend the literature on the effects of videogame play in young children, as well as extend and support the developmental psychobiological literature on cortisol-stress response in young children, including its relation to age and temperament. Cortisol levels, aggression, attention, and compliance were measured before and after play with a non-violent videogame for the treatment group, and before and after a children’s television program for the control group. Participants were 75 typically developing 5 to 7 year-old boys with videogame play experience, and their families. Children participated in a 1- hour laboratory session that included pre and posttest measures of salivary cortisol, free-play, and attention. A posttest interview was also administered to measure levels of interpersonal aggression. Parents completed three surveys: The Child Behavior Questionnaire (Ahadi, Rothbart, & Ye, 1993); The Child Behavior Checklist (Achenbach, & Edelbrock, 1981); and a demographic questionnaire. Parents also completed a posttest phone interview to assess child non-compliance. Data reported here confirm that boys who played routine, non-violent videogames demonstrated a significant increase in observable levels of object aggression immediately after videogame play, as well as an increase in non-compliance to parental requests for several hours after videogame play. In support of previous research (e.g., Davis, Donzella, Krueger, & Gunnar, 1999), children who scored higher on the temperamental dimension of surgency/extraversion exhibited significantly higher levels of cortisol two hours-posttest than non-surgent children. Boys in the videogame condition had higher levels of cortisol than boys in the control condition two hours posttest, but this effect was independent of temperamental profile, and did not reflect a within subject increase in cortisol. Contrary to expectations, older, not younger, children demonstrated increased levels of aggression, younger boys did not differ from older boys on levels of cortisol, and attention was not compromised by videogame play. The behavioral effects of videogame play warrant precautionary measures for surgent and non-surgent children with regard to routine videogame exposure. Suggestions for future researchers include longer-term follow-up, expansion of age ranges, and greater numbers of cortisol collections.

,Grand Theft Childhood: The Surprising Truth About Violent Video Games And What Parents Can Do.,"Listening to pundits and politicians, you'd think that the relationship between violent video games and aggressive behavior in children is clear. Children who play violent video games are more likely to be socially isolated and have poor interpersonal skills. Violent games can trigger real-world violence. The best way to protect our kids is to keep them away from games such as Grand Theft Auto that are rated M for Mature. Right? Wrong. In fact, many parents are worried about the wrong things! In 2004, Lawrence Kutner, PhD, and Cheryl K. Olson, ScD, cofounders and directors of the Harvard Medical School Center for Mental Health and Media, began a $1.5 million federally funded study on the effects of video games. In contrast to previous research, their study focused on real children and families in real situations. What they found surprised, encouraged and sometimes disturbed them: their findings conform to the views of neither the alarmists nor the video game industry boosters. In _Grand Theft Childhood: The Surprising Truth about Violent Video Games and What Parents Can Do_, Kutner and Olson untangle the web of politics, marketing, advocacy and flawed or misconstrued studies that until now have shaped parents' concerns. Instead of offering a one-size-fits-all prescription, _Grand Theft Childhood_ gives the information you need to decide how you want to handle this sensitive issue in your own family. You'll learn when -- and what kinds of -- video games can be harmful, when they can serve as important social or learning tools and how to create and enforce game-playing rules in your household. You'll find out what's really in the games your children play and when to worry about your children playing with strangers on the Internet. You'll understand how games are rated, how to make best use of ratings and the potentially important information that ratings don't provide. _Grand Theft Childhood_ takes video games out of the political and media arenas, and puts parents back in control. It should be required reading for all families who use game consoles or computers. Almost all children today play video or computer games. Half of twelve-year- olds regularly play violent, Mature-rated games. And parents are worried... _""I don't know if it's an addiction, but my son is just glued to it. It's the same with my daughter with her computer...and I can't be watching both of them all the time, to see if they're talking to strangers or if someone is getting killed in the other room on the PlayStation. It's just nerve-racking!"" ""I'm concerned that this game playing is just the kid and the TV screen...how is this going to affect his social skills?"" ""I'm not concerned about the violence; I'm concerned about the way they portray the violence. It's not accidental; it's intentional. They're just out to kill people in some of these games."" _ What should we as parents, teachers and public policy makers be concerned about? The real risks are subtle and aren't just about gore or sex. Video games don't affect all children in the same way; some children are at significantly greater risk. (You may be surprised to learn which ones!) _Grand Theft Childhood_ gives parents practical, research-based advice on ways to limit many of those risks. It also shows how video games -- even violent games -- can benefit children and families in unexpected ways. In this groundbreaking and timely book, Drs. Lawrence Kutner and Cheryl Olson cut through the myths and hysteria, and reveal the surprising truth about kids and violent games.",no_id,anderson2010_126,anderson2010,"Kutner, L., & Olsen, C.

,"Impact Of Violence Exposure On Hostility, Physiological Arousal, And Health In Youth. Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B.","This study examined the joint effects of lifetime exposure to violence within the home and community and acute exposure to media violence on hostility, physiological arousal, and attitudes toward health risk behaviors. One hundred male undergraduates aged 18-21 who had previously reported low or high lifetime amounts of violence were randomly assigned to play a videogame low (The Simpsons: Hit and Run) or high (Grand Theft Auto III; GTA III) in violent content. Participants randomly assigned to GTA III exhibited greater changes in systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure from the initial rest period to game play, and greater negative affect subsequent to game play, in comparison to adolescents randomly assigned to The Simpsons. Participants randomly assigned to GTA III also exhibited more permissive attitudes towards drinking alcohol and using marijuana and were more competitive during a subsequent task. Greater lifetime violence exposure was associated with greater changes in SBP and pulse rate from the initial rest period to game play and with more permissive attitudes towards violence and drinking alcohol. Two interactions between lifetime violence exposure and laboratory media violence condition were found. Within the low lifetime violence exposure group, videogame condition was not associated with change in SBP from the initial rest period to game play, while within the high lifetime violence exposure group, play of Grand Theft Auto III predicted greater changes in SBP. Lifetime community violence exposure interacted with laboratory media violence condition in predicting hostile attributions. Within the high community violence exposure group, play of GTA III was associated with greater likelihood that participants would think a teacher would accuse them of cheating. The present study is the first experimental study to show that media violence is associated with permissive attitudes towards health risk behaviors that do not directly involve hostility or aggression, such as alcohol and marijuana use. Media violence effects observed in the laboratory may be representative of how any type of violence exposure influences youth, including real-world violence within homes and communities. One consequence of acute or chronic violence exposure among young men may be a greater willingness to engage in generally risky behavior.",no_id,anderson2010_80,anderson2010,"Brady, S. (2006).

,Television And Video Game Violence: Age Differences And The Combined Effects Of Passive And Interactive Violent Media. Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B.,"The present research examined the combined effects of violent video games and violent TV programs on third and sixth-grade boys’ thoughts and behavior. In individual sessions, demographic information about the children’s television viewing and video game playing habits was collected. Participants were exposed to one of six following media conditions for 15 minutes; a) watch a violent (wrestling) or a nonviolent video segment (basketball), b) play a violent or a non-violent game, or c) watch a violent or non-violent video segment and then play a video game containing the same characters and content. The potential for violent media to prime aggression was examined by utilizing two cognitive (word-stem completion task and normative beliefs about aggression questionnaire) and one behavioral measure (Bobo doll interaction). Exposure to violent media was expected to lead to increased aggressive thoughts and behaviors in both younger and older children. Younger children were expected to be more strongly influenced by violent media than older children. However, older boys were expected to demonstrate greater priming on the word-completion task. Finally, consistent with Huesmann’s (1986) social developmental theory, the combination of violent video games and violent television content was expected influence children more strongly than either video games or television alone. Key findings of the present research were as follows: 1) Children exposed to violent media content endorsed higher levels of aggressive behavior than did children exposed to non-violent content. 2) Children exposed to violence in the combined media condition endorsed significantly higher levels of aggressive behavior than did those in the non-violent media condition. 3) Sixth-grade boys endorsed higher levels of aggressive behavior and produced more aggressive words on the word-stem completion task than did third-grade boys. 4) Third-grade boys were more aggressive toward the Bobo doll than were sixth-grade boys.",no_id,anderson2010_131,anderson2010,"Meyers, K.

,The Physical And Emotional Experience Of Violence In Video Games. Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B.,"Despite a considerable amount of speculation regarding the psychological significance of violence in video games, the research literature has yet to present a clear understanding of its consequence. The present research sought to develop increased understanding of video game violence through focus on two poorly understood areas of the literature: (Study 1) the relationship between violence, physiological arousal and attitudes toward guns and violence; (Study 2) the influence of violence on the way boys perceive goodness and badness. In order to address both research areas, 45 boys, ranging in age from 16-19 were randomly assigned to one of three separate groups that would be exposed to differing levels of video game violence. They were provided questionnaires before playing the games that assessed: (a) attitudes toward guns and violence; (b) thoughts and feelings on goodness and badness, and (c) video gaming habits. A week later, baseline measures of arousal (heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure) were obtained for each participant prior to game play. After playing a non-violent game or another game with violence features turned on or off, each participant had a post heart rate blood pressure reading taken and completed a post survey on goodness and badness. The results of Study 1 did not find significant change in heart rate or blood pressure for either the control condition or for the groups exposed to differing levels of violence over a 30 minute game play period. Furthermore, there was no evidence that attitudes toward guns and violence or race influenced physiological response. In the context of the literature on arousal, the results suggest that arousal as a factor of violence does occur though it is ephemeral. Study 2 sought to explore whether violence in video games might be a venue for adolescents to explore ethical self-development; and whether this exploration may be evident in how they articulate goodness and badness. Although statistically significant change was noted on individual survey questions, overall, change was minimal. While the results do not support the proposed theoretical model, further suggestions for exploration are discussed.",no_id,anderson2010_93,anderson2010,The Sciences and Engineering,"Dubenitz, J.",2005,THES,NA,reviewer1,Tamas
,[Effect Of Viewing A Long Stereoscopic Film On Equilibrium Function And Autonomic Nervous System].,"Owing to the recent rapid advancements in image processing and three-dimensional (3-D) technologies, stereoscopic images can now be viewed on television as well as in theaters and on gaming consoles among others. However, with these advancements, there have also been reports on motion sickness and asthenopia induced by viewing stereoscopic films. Human equilibrium function deteriorates when viewing stereoscopic films, which may lead to motion sickness; however, the exact cause of such motion sickness remains unknown. Therefore, as part of hygiene research that contributes to society, it is important to consider the safety of viewing virtual 3D contents. In this study, we investigated the effects of viewing 2-D/3-D video clips on the human body by stabilometry, electrogastrography (EGG), and subjective assessments. Seven subjects aged 22 to 24 viewed 2-D/3-D video clips for 60 min. A comparison of time series data obtained at rest shows a significant change in the EGG patterns 20 min after the start of viewing the video clips. Furthermore, sway values while viewing the 3-D video clips were considerably higher than those while viewing the 2-D video clips 60 min after the start of viewing. These findings show that the autonomic nervous system is affected first by long-term viewing of stereoscopic films, and the equilibrium function deteriorates gradually over the course of the exposure.",doi,10.1265/jjh.71.30,pubmed,Nihon eiseigaku zasshi.

,"“Beauty Sleeping In The Lap Of Horror”: Landscape Aesthetics And Gothic Pleasures, From The Castle Of Otranto To Video Games","In the latter part of the eighteenth century a new enthusiasm-a new way of looking at the physical world-swept through England. This new landscape aesthetic was generally expressed in terms of the closely interrelated concepts of the sublime, the beautiful, and the picturesque. As a system of artistic, psychological, and philosophical references, the aesthetic fired the imaginations of many eighteenth-century British novelists, especially those who were turning their attention to a then-emerging fictional form, the Gothic novel. The ideas encompassed by this system of landscape aesthetics were perfect vehicles for these eighteenth-century stories of suspense and terror; and during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, this adaptable aesthetic continued to provide a common reference point for creators and readers of Gothic fiction. Even today, although we may not use the same terminology, landscape aesthetics based on the sublime, the beautiful, and the picturesque are still alive and well in popular culture. Many modern-day writers and artists who work in the Gothic tradition-from novelists to film makers to video game designers-continue to draw from the same aesthetic conventions. The plot constructs that thrill today’s audiences (attacks by space aliens; love stories of teenage vampires) differ from the constructs used by eighteenth-century authors (menacing, ghostly figures; terrified virgins fleeing would-be seducers). Nevertheless, the complex emotions-apprehension and terror, anticipation and pleasure-evoked by the best Gothic fictions have remained remarkably consistent.1 This chapter shows how some of the best-respected practitioners of Gothic have, over the years, used specific elements of an eighteenth-century aesthetic canon to produce specific emotional responses in their audience-that is, to produce the range of feelings that comprise the “delicious terror” of the true Gothic experience. © The Author(s) 2016.",doi,10.1007/978-3-319-33165-2_4,Scopus,"Gothic Landscapes: Changing Eras, Changing Cultures, Changing Anxieties",Davenport A.,2016,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,A Bioinspired Approach For A Multizone Temperature Control System,"Bioinspired design approaches seek to exploit nature in order to construct optimal solutions for engineering problems as uniform temperature control in multizone systems. The ideal free distribution (IFD) is a concept from behavioural ecology, which describes the arrangement of individuals in different habitats such that at equilibrium, all habitats are equally suitable. Here, we relax the IFD's main assumptions using the standing-crop idea to introduce dynamics into the supplies of each habitat. Then, we make an analogy with a multizone thermal system to propose a controller based on the replicator dynamics model, in order to obtain a maximum uniform temperature subject to constant power injection. Besides, we analytically show that the equilibrium point of the controlled system is asymptotically stable. Finally, some practical results obtained with a testbed and comparisons with the theoretical results are presented. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.",doi,10.1088/1748-3182/6/1/016007,Scopus,Bioinspiration and Biomimetics,"Pantoja A., Quijano N., Leirens S.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,A Case Of Massive Pulmonary Thromboembolism In A Young Man Attribute To Computer Gaming,"Pulmonary thromboembolism occurs in old patients with risk factors, such as, immobilization, chronic medical disease, trauma, a hereditary hypercoagulable state, and others. However, we experienced a young man with a massive pulmonary thromboembolism attributed to immobilization due to computer gaming. The patient had been playing computer games in a seated position for at least five hour continually, and for twelve hours per day over a two-week period. The 36-year-old patient was transferred to our institute rule out the possibility of an acute myocardial infarction. Computer tomography revealed intraluminal filling defects in the distal main pulmonary artery and the left popliteal vein. He received thrombolytic therapy and subsequently recovered without complications. This case raises the possibility that prolonged computer gaming is a risk factor of thromboembolism in young adults.

,A Comparative Investigation Of Non-Linear Activation Functions In Neural Controllers For Search-Based Game Ai Engineering,"The creation of intelligent video game controllers has recently become one of the greatest challenges in game artificial intelligence research, and it is arguably one of the fastest-growing areas in game design and development. The learning process, a very important feature of intelligent methods, is the result of an intelligent game controller to determine and control the game objects behaviors' or actions autonomously. Our approach is to use a more efficient learning model in the form of artificial neural networks for training the controllers. We propose a Hill-Climbing Neural Network (HillClimbNet) that controls the movement of the Ms. Pac-man agent to travel around the maze, gobble all of the pills and escape from the ghosts in the maze. HillClimbNet combines the hill-climbing strategy with a simple, feed-forward artificial neural network architecture. The aim of this study is to analyze the performance of various activation functions for the purpose of generating neural-based controllers to play a video game. Each non-linear activation function is applied identically for all the nodes in the network, namely log-sigmoid, logarithmic, hyperbolic tangent-sigmoid and Gaussian. In general, the results shows an optimum configuration is achieved by using log-sigmoid, while Gaussian is the worst activation function.©Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.",doi,10.1007/s10462-011-9294-y,Scopus,Artificial Intelligence Review,"Tan T.G., Teo J., Anthony P.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,A Meta-Analysis Of Active Video Games On Health Outcomes Among Children And Adolescents,"This meta-analysis synthesizes current literature concerning the effects of active video games (AVGs) on children/adolescents' health-related outcomes. A total of 512 published studies on AVGs were located, and 35 articles were included based on the following criteria: (i) data-based research articles published in English between 1985 and 2015; (ii) studied some types of AVGs and related outcomes among children/adolescents and (iii) had at least one comparison within each study. Data were extracted to conduct comparisons for outcome measures in three separate categories: AVGs and sedentary behaviours, AVGs and laboratory-based exercise, and AVGs and field-based physical activity. Effect size for each entry was calculated with the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software in 2015. Mean effect size (Hedge's g) and standard deviation were calculated for each comparison. Compared with sedentary behaviours, AVGs had a large effect on health outcomes. The effect sizes for physiological outcomes were marginal when comparing AVGs with laboratory-based exercises. The comparison between AVGs and field-based physical activity had null to moderate effect sizes. AVGs could yield equivalent health benefits to children/adolescents as laboratory-based exercise or field-based physical activity. Therefore, AVGs can be a good alternative for sedentary behaviour and addition to traditional physical activity and sports in children/adolescents. © 2015 World Obesity.",doi,10.1111/obr.12287,Scopus,Obesity Reviews,"Gao Z., Chen S., Pasco D., Pope Z.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,A Multi-Functional Entertaining And Educational Robot,"This paper presents a multi-functional autonomous intelligent robot, DOC-1, which has actions exclusively driven by artificial intelligence programs. The mechanism of this robot was designed to fulfill tasks defined by various functions such as gripping character cubes and teacups, playing the Gobang board game, and rotating and stacking character cubes. Further emphasis was placed on load lifting capability, weight reduction, energy conservation, and performance reliability. The serial port of a minicomputer is used as the communication interface between the software and electromechanical components. A custom-made chip serves as the control kernel that controls the motions of servo motors that move the arms and head of the robot, two DC motors which drive the wheels, and also a number of lights. With the integrated artificial intelligence software and the robot control system, this intelligent robot DOC-1 can perform a number of autonomous functions that make it interactive with human beings. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",doi,10.1007/s10846-008-9241-6,Scopus,Journal of Intelligent and Robotic Systems: Theory and Applications,"Lin C.-Y., Tseng C.-K., Jo P.-C.",2008,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,A Musical System For Emotional Expression,"The automatic control of emotional expression in music is a challenge that is far from being solved. This paper describes research conducted with the aim of developing a system with such capabilities. The system works with standard MIDI files and develops in two stages: the first offline, the second online. In the first stage, MIDI files are partitioned in segments with uniform emotional content. These are subjected to a process of features extraction, then classified according to emotional values of valence and arousal and stored in a music base. In the second stage, segments are selected and transformed according to the desired emotion and then arranged in song-like structures. The system is using a knowledge base, grounded on empirical results of works of Music Psychology that was refined with data obtained with questionnaires; we also plan to use data obtained with other methods of emotional recognition in a near future. For the experimental setups, we prepared web-based questionnaires with musical segments of different emotional content. Each subject classified each segment after listening to it, with values for valence and arousal. The modularity, adaptability and flexibility of our system's architecture make it applicable in various contexts like video-games, theater, films and healthcare contexts. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

,Action Games: Evolutive Experiences,"This paper defends the employment of Evolutive Algorithms (EAs) in action games by showing their virtues for both offline and online opponent controlling. The paper proposes (and also compares) several EAs applied offline in the solving of a classical path finding problem and used to provide intelligence to autonomous agents (e.g., the opponents) in an action computer game. The paper also presents an EA that has been successfully employed in real time (i.e., online) in an action game in which a player controls a military vehicle in a hostile enemy region. © 2006 Springer.",doi,10.1007/3-540-31182-3_45,Scopus,Advances in Soft Computing,"Fernández A.J., Jiménez González J.",2006,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Active Video Game Exercise Training Improves The Clinical Control Of Asthma In Children: Randomized Controlled Trial,"Objective The aim of the present study was to determine whether aerobic exercise involving an active video game system improved asthma control, airway inflammation and exercise capacity in children with moderate to severe asthma. Design A randomized, controlled, single-blinded clinical trial was carried out. Thirty-six children with moderate to severe asthma were randomly allocated to either a video game group (VGG; N = 20) or a treadmill group (TG; n = 16). Both groups completed an eight-week supervised program with two weekly 40-minute sessions. Pre-training and post-training evaluations involved the Asthma Control Questionnaire, exhaled nitric oxide levels (FeNO), maximum exercise testing (Bruce protocol) and lung function. Results No differences between the VGG and TG were found at the baseline. Improvements occurred in both groups with regard to asthma control and exercise capacity. Moreover, a significant reduction in FeNO was found in the VGG (p < 0.05). Although the mean energy expenditure at rest and during exercise training was similar for both groups, the maximum energy expenditure was higher in the VGG. Conclusion The present findings strongly suggest that aerobic training promoted by an active video game had a positive impact on children with asthma in terms of clinical control, improvementin their exercise capacity and a reductionin pulmonary inflammation.

,Activity Profile And Physiological Demands Of Top-Class Soccer Assistant Refereeing In Relation To Training Status,"To determine the movement patterns and physiological demands of top-class soccer assistant referees, we performed computerized time-motion analysis and measured heart rate and blood lactate concentration in 15 assistant referees during 22 competitive matches in the top Danish league. To relate match performance to the physical capability of the assistant referees, they performed a 3 × 30 m sprint protocol before and after matches and a laboratory treadmill test within 3 weeks of the games. The mean total distance covered by the top-class assistant referees was 7.28 (range 5.78-8.16) km, of which 1.15 (0.86-1.44) km was high-intensity running and 1.16 (0.12-2.34) km was sideways running. The amount of high-intensity running during a game was correlated with performance of repeated sprints (r = 0.80, P &lt; 0.05). Mean heart rate was 137 (117-159) beats.min-1, corresponding to 73% (60-88%) of maximal heart rate and 65% (53-80%) of maximal oxygen uptake. Blood lactate concentration was 4.7 (1.6-11.0) and 4.8 (1.1-13.7) mmol.l-1 after the first and second half, respectively. Sprinting performance was poorer (P &lt; 0.05) after than before the games. The peak distance to the offside line was greater (P &lt; 0.05) in the second than the first half (7 ± 1 vs 5 ± 0 m). Our results show that: (1) top-class assistant soccer refereeing is characterized by brief intense bouts of forward and sideways running interspersed with long periods of low activity; (2) top-class soccer assistant referees have moderate aerobic energy production during games with episodes of high aerobic and anaerobic energy turnover; (3) assistant referees' performance of repeated sprints correlates with the amount of high-intensity running performed in a game; and (4) sprint performance decreases towards the end of a game, which appears to affect assistant referees' ability to keep up with play.",doi,10.1080/026404102320761778,Scopus,Journal of Sports Sciences,"Krustrup P., Mohr M., Bangsbo J.",2002,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Adaptation In Affective Video Games: A Literature Review,"Playing computer games is a predominantly emotional than rational process. Video games with affect-based adaptation measure player's behavior signals and recognize player's emotional states in order to adapt specific game features in a dynamic manner and to improve player's engagement, immersion, excitement, and challenge. The present review deals with models for the presentation of emotions, techniques for measuring behavioral signals, emotion recognition and adaptation mechanisms applied in video games with affective feedback including methods for their assessment and validation. Studies using self-reports, observational methods and psychophysiological measurements of both autonomic and central nervous systems including processing and interpretation of signals are systematically reviewed with regard to their results concerning emotional adaptation in games. Next, the article provides a comparative analysis of affect-based adaptation methods and techniques applied in 14 adaptive video games developed in last ten years. Based on this comparison, we summarized future directions in research, design and evaluation of video games with affective adaption.",doi,10.1515/cait-2016-0032,Scopus,Cybernetics and Information Technologies,Bontchev B.,2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,"Adolescent Neck And Shoulder Pain - The Association With Depression, Physical Activity, Screen-Based Activities, And Use Of Health Care Services","Purpose Neck and shoulder pain is frequent in adolescents, and multiple factors seem to affect the risk of such symptoms. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of neck and shoulder pain in Norwegian adolescence and to examine whether behavioral and emotional factors were associated with the risk of neck and shoulder pain. Finally we aimed to investigate whether neck and shoulder pain was related to the use of health services. Method Data from the population-based study ung@hordaland were used. Participants were asked how often during the last 6 months they had experienced neck and shoulder pain. The association between frequent neck and shoulder pain and physical activity, symptoms of depression, and screen-based activities was evaluated using logistic regression analyses stratified by gender. The relative risk of visiting health services when reporting neck and shoulder pain was calculated using multiple logistic regression analyses. Results Frequent neck and shoulder pain was reported by 20.0% (1,797 of the total 8,990) and more often by girls than boys (p <.001). A high score of depressive symptoms was the strongest risk factor for neck and shoulder pain in both boys and girls (odds ratio = 6.14 [95% confidence interval 4.48-8.42] and odds ratio = 3.10 [95% confidence interval 2.63-3.67], respectively). Frequent screen-based activities slightly increased the risk while physical activity was protective. Individuals reporting neck and shoulder pain more often visited their general practitioner (47.1% vs. 31.8%) and school health services (24.6% vs. 13.5%). Conclusion Frequent neck and shoulder pain was reported in 20% of Norwegian adolescents. Symptoms of depression and screen-based activities increased the risk of neck and shoulder pain while physical activity was protective. Individuals reporting neck and shoulder pain visited health services more frequently than others. © 2014 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

,Adolescents' Sedentary Behaviors In Two European Cities,"Purpose: The aim of this study was to determine and compare the correlates of objective sedentary behavior (SB) and nonschool self-reported SB in adolescents from 2 midsized cities, 1 in France (Tarbes) and 1 in Spain (Huesca). Stability of objective SB and nonschool self-reported SB were also assessed at different time points during 1 academic year. Method: Starting with a total of 829 participants and after applying inclusion criteria, objective SB was assessed for 646 adolescents (Mage = 14.30 ± 0.71 years) with GT3X accelerometers for 7 days at 2 time points. Nonschool self-reported SB was measured for 781 adolescents (Mage = 14.46 ± 0.76 years) at 3 time points by means of a questionnaire. Data were analyzed using multiple regression analysis. Results: Gender and ambient temperature emerged as the main statistically significant correlates in all objective SB models, showing higher objective SB levels in girls and lower objective SB levels when ambient temperature was higher. According to nonschool self-reported SB, a gender effect was found in almost all behaviors. Whereas boys spent more time playing with video games as well as games on their mobile phones, girls spent more time studying and using their computers and mobile phones to communicate with each other. The findings showed a statistically significant city effect on study time (Huesca > Tarbes) and video games and telephone communication time (Tarbes > Huesca). Conclusion: Nonschool self-reported SB patterns were different in Huesca and Tarbes. Intervention programs should be adapted to target the reduction of adolescents' SB according to different contexts. © 2015 Copyright © SHAPE America.",doi,10.1080/02701367.2015.1039891,Scopus,Research Quarterly for Exercise and Sport,"Aibar Solana A., Bois J.E., Zaragoza J., Bru N., Paillard T., Generelo E.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Affect Of The Game Player: Short-Term Effects Of Highly And Mildly Aggressive Video Games.,"Two experiments were conducted to examine the effects of playing different types of video games on players' short-term affective states. In the first experiment, college student subjects played 11 different video games and rated them on a number of characteristics. From these ratings, two games were selected for use in Experiment 2. These games differed only in the level of aggression displayed. One was highly aggressive; the other was only mildly aggressive. In Experiment 2, each subject played one of the games or was assigned to a no-game control condition. Hostility, anxiety, and depression subsequently were assessed by the Multiple Affect Adjective Checklist. Hostility was increased in both game conditions, relative to the control group. The high-aggression game led to higher hostility than the mild-aggression game, but the difference was not significant. However, those who had played the high-aggression game were significantly more anxious than either those who played the mild-aggression game or those who played no game (control). As expected, the experimental manipulation of game playing did not yield a main effect on depressive affect. Finally, there was a marginally significant sex by game interaction effect on the depression scores.",doi,10.1177/0146167286124002,anderson2010,Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin,"Anderson, C.

,Affective State And Decision-Making In The Ultimatum Game,"The emerging field of neuroeconomics has provided evidence that emotional as well as cognitive processes may contribute to economic decision-making. Indeed, activation of the anterior insula, a brain area involved in emotional processing, has been shown to predict decision-making in the Ultimatum Game. However, as the insula has also been implicated in other brain functions, converging evidence on the role of emotion in the Ultimatum Game is needed. In the present study, 30 healthy undergraduate students played the Ultimatum Game while their skin conductance responses were measured as an autonomic index of affective state. The results revealed that skin conductance activity was higher for unfair offers and was associated with the rejection of unfair offers in the Ultimatum Game. Interestingly, this pattern was only observed for offers proposed by human conspecifics, but not for offers generated by computers. This provides direct support for economic models that acknowledge the role of emotional brain systems in everyday decision-making. © Springer-Verlag 2006.",doi,10.1007/s00221-006-0346-5,Scopus,Experimental Brain Research,"Van't Wout M., Kahn R.S., Sanfey A.G., Aleman A.",2006,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Age Differences In Responses To Progressive Social Exclusion: The Role Of Cognition And Socioemotional Functioning,"Objectives.In prior research, older adults were found to be less responsive to social slights than younger adults, but the mechanisms behind such effects have remained unclear. The present study examined age differences in susceptibility to the deleterious effects of social exclusion and investigated the explanatory role of cognitive and socioemotional variables.Method.Forty younger adults (aged 22-39) and 40 older adults (aged 58-89) played a modified version of ""Cyberball,"" a virtual ball-tossing game, in which they were initially included by 2 other players and progressively excluded in subsequent rounds. After each round, participants reported their emotions and needs satisfaction.Results.Older adults were less likely than younger adults to respond to mild levels of social exclusion, but both age groups responded similarly to more pronounced exclusion. Within the older group, participants with lower cognitive functioning were less responsive to mild exclusion, but this effect did not reach significance in the younger group.Discussion.Future research on age differences in responses to social exclusion should further explore the role of cognition and examine possible implications for interpersonal functioning. © 2012 The Author.

,Agent Negotiation Of Target Distribution Enhancing System Survivability,"This article proposes an agent negotiation model for target distribution across a set of geographically dispersed sensors. The key idea is to consider sensors as autonomous agents that negotiate over the division of tasks among them for obtaining better payoffs. The negotiation strategies for agents are established based upon the concept of subgame perfect equilibrium from game theory. Using such negotiation leads to not only superior measuring performance from a global perspective but also possibly balanced allocations of tasks to sensors, benefiting system robustness and survivability. A simulation test and results are given to demonstrate the ability of our approach in improving system security while keeping overall measuring performance near optimal. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",doi,10.1002/int.7006,Scopus,International Journal of Intelligent Systems,"Xiong N., Christensen H., Svensson P.",2007,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Aggression In Children With Behavioural/Emotional Difficulties: Seeing Aggression On Television And Video Games,"Background: Mental health professionals are often asked to give advice about managing children's aggression. Good quality evidence on contributory environmental factors such as seeing aggression on television and in video games is relatively lacking, although societal and professional concerns are high. This study investigated possible associations between seeing aggression in such media and the aggressive behaviour of children attending specialist outpatient child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS). Methods: In this mixed methods study, forty-seven British children aged 7-11 years with behavioural/emotional difficulties attending CAMHS and their carers participated in a survey twenty purposively-selected children and a parent/carer of theirs participated in a qualitative study, involving semi-structured interviews, analysed using the Framework Analysis Approach; findings were integrated. Results: Children attending CAMHS exhibit clinically significant aggression, of varying types and frequency. They see aggression in multiple real and virtual settings. Verbal aggression was often seen, frequently exhibited and strongly associated with poor peer relationships and low prosocial behaviour. Children did not think seeing aggression influences their own behaviour but believed it influences others. Carers regarded aggression as resulting from a combination of inner and environmental factors and seeing aggression in real-life as having more impact than television/video games. Conclusions: There is yet no definitive evidence for or against a direct relationship between aggression seen in the media and aggression in children with behavioural/emotional difficulties. Future research should take an ecological perspective, investigating individual, developmental and environmental factors. Carers, professional organisations and policy makers should address aggression seen in all relevant area of children's lives, primarily real-life and secondly virtual environments. © 2014 Mitrofan et al.",doi,10.1186/s12888-014-0287-7,Scopus,BMC Psychiatry,"Mitrofan O., Paul M., Weich S., Spencer N.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Altered Functional Connectivity Of The Insula And Nucleus Accumbens In Internet Gaming Disorder: A Resting State Fmri Study,"Aims: A possible addiction mechanism has been represented by altered functional connectivity (FC) in the resting state. The aim of this study was to evaluate the FCs of the insula and nucleus accumbens among subjects with Internet gaming disorder (IGD). Methods: We recruited 30 males with IGD and 30 controls and evaluated their FC using functional magnetic imaging scanning under resting, a state with relaxation, closed eyes, with inducement to think of nothing systematically, become motionless, and instructed not to fall asleep. Results: Subjects with IGD had a lower FC with the left insula over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and orbital frontal lobe and a higher FC with the insula with the contralateral insula than controls. The inter-hemispheric insula connectivity positively correlated with impulsivity. Further, they had lower FC with the left nucleus accumbens over the left DLPFC and with the right nucleus accumbens over the left DLPFC, and insula and a higher FC with that over the right precuneus. Conclusion: The elevated inter-hemispheric insula FC is found to be associated with impulsivity and might explain why it is involved in IGD. The attenuated frontostriatal suggests that the emotion-driven gaming urge through nucleus accumbens could not be well regulated by the frontal lobe of subjects with IGD. © 2016 S.

,An Emotional Student Model For Game-Play Adaptation,"Game-based learning offers key advantages for learning through experience in conjunction with offering multi-sensorial and engaging communication. However, ensuring that learning has taken place is the ultimate challenge. Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) have been incorporated into game-based learning environments to guide learners' exploration. Emotions have proven to be deeply intertwined with cognitive and motivational factors. ITSs attempt to recognise and convey emotion in order to enhance students' learning and engagement. The ITS student model is responsible for attainment of adaptability and understanding of learners' needs. It is not clear which emotions are relevant to the teaching-learning experience, or what antecedents and interpersonal differences are involved in determining an emotion. Therefore, student modelling involves uncertainty. Creating an emotional student model that can reason about students' observable behaviour during online game-play is the main goal of our research. The analysis, design and implementation for this model are our central focus here. The model uses as a basis the Control-Value theory of achievement emotions and employs motivational and cognitive variables to determine an emotion. A Probabilistic Relational Model (PRM) approach was applied to facilitate the derivation of three Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) corresponding to three types of achievement emotions. Results from a prototyping exercise conducted along with the outcome-prospective emotions DBN are presented and discussed. In future work a larger population of students will be employed to develop an accurate DBN model to incorporate into PlayPhysics, an emotional game-based learning environment for teaching Physics. © 2010 International Federation for Information Processing.",doi,10.1016/j.entcom.2010.12.006,Scopus,Entertainment Computing,"Muñoz K., Kevitt P.M., Lunney T., Noguez J., Neri L.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,An Emotionally Biased Ant Colony Algorithm For Pathfinding In Games,"Pathfinding is one of the tasks, apart from graphics rendering, requiring most CPU resources. Although there are many approaches to effectively solve pathfinding problems, they are becoming less suitable as more and more games have larger game worlds that dynamically change during the game play. These new games have more visually realistic graphics that increase the game characters realism but all these efforts may be useless if game characters perform dumb movements or follow inappropriate paths such as repeatedly walking close to an enemy or a predator while moving from one location to another. To tackle this problem we present in this paper an ant colony algorithm for path finding that takes into account the emotions of the game characters and we show how our approach is used in an augmented-reality educational game. The proposed algorithm is implemented on a GPU processor to demonstrate its scalability with large problem sizes when compared to its corresponding CPU version. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

,An Empirical Study About The Use Of The Internet And Computer Games Among Croatian Children,"This book chapter is dedicated to theoretical and empirical review of media among children. Empirical results about computer presence in family homes, IT literacy with different computer programmes among parents, as well children are described. In addition, attitudes of parents and preschool and school-aged children about using Internet and computer games as well as attitudes toward the Internet violence are analysed. The results of games types that children play as well as frequency of playing and children's emotions evoked by them are shown. Finally, the results about presence of significant others as well as their conversation with children are shown. All of the above are interestingly studied in the frame of correlation analysis to research relations between some socio-demographic variables (sex, age, the level of education, and presence of computer in family home), so certain future research guidelines can be established. © 2015, IGI Global.

,An Extension Of A Fuzzy Reputation Agent Trust Model (Afras) In The Art Testbed,"With the introduction of web services, users require an automated way of determining their reliability and even their matching to personal and subjective preferences. Therefore, trust modelling of web services, managed in an autonomous way by intelligent agents, is a challenging and relevant issue. Due to the dynamic and distributed nature of web services, recommendations of web services from third parties may also play an important role to build and update automated trust models. In this context, the agent reputation and trust (ART) testbed has been used to compare trust models in three international competitions. The testbed runs locally and defines an ART appraisal domain with a simulation engine, although the trust models may be applied to any kind of automated and remote services, such as web services. Our previous works proposed an already-published trust model called AFRAS that used fuzzy sets to represent reputation of service providers and of recommenders of such services. In this paper we describe the extension required in the trust model to participate in these competitions. The extension consists of a trust strategy that applies the AFRAS trust model to the ART testbed concepts and protocols. An implementation of this extension of AFRAS trust model has participated in the (Spanish and International) 2006 ART competitions. Using this ART platform and some of the agents who participated, we executed a set of ART games to evaluate the relevance of trust strategy over trust model, and the advantage of using fuzzy representation of trust and reputation. © Springer-Verlag 2009.",doi,10.1007/s00500-009-0470-9,Scopus,Soft Computing,"Carbo J., Molina-Lopez J.M.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,"An Impact Study Of The Design Of Exergaming Parameters On Body Intensity From Objective And Gameplay-Based Player Experience Perspectives, Based On Balance Training Exergame","Kinect-based exergames allow players to undertake physical exercise in an interactive manner with visual stimulation. Previous studies focused on investigating physical fitness based on calories or heart rate to ascertain the effectiveness of exergames. However, designing an exergame for specific training purposes, with intensity levels suited to the needs and skills of the players, requires the investigation of motion performance to study player experience.This study investigates how parameters of a Kinect-based exergame, combined with balance training exercises, influence the balance control ability and intensity level the player can tolerate, by analyzing both objective and gameplay-based player experience, and taking enjoyment and difficulty levels into account.The exergame tested required participants to maintain their balance standing on one leg within a posture frame (PF) while a force plate evaluated the player's balance control ability in both static and dynamic gaming modes. The number of collisions with the PF depended on the frame's travel time for static PFs, and the leg-raising rate and angle for dynamic PFs. In terms of center of pressure (COP) metrics, significant impacts were caused by the frame's travel time on MDIST-AP for static PFs, and the leg-raising rate on MDIST-ML and TOTEX for dynamic PFs. The best static PF balance control performance was observed with a larger frame offset by a travel time of 2 seconds, and the worst performance with a smaller frame and a travel time of 1 second. The best dynamic PF performance was with a leg-raising rate of 1 second at a 45-degree angle, while the worst performance was with a rate of 2 seconds at a 90-degree angle.The results demonstrated that different evaluation methods for player experience could result in different findings, making it harder to study the design of those exergames with training purposes based on player experience. © 2013 Sun and Lee.",doi,10.1371/journal.pone.0069471,Scopus,PLoS ONE,"Sun T.-L., Lee C.-H.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,An Institutional Case Study: Emotion Regulation With Heartmath At Santa Cruz County Children's Mental Health.,"This case study from Santa Cruz County Children's Mental Health Agency (CMH), California, reviews the use of measurement of heart rate variability (HRV) to enhance emotional regulation of patients. CMH serves seriously emotionally disturbed youths, many of whom have been separated from their parents for a prolonged period or have been vulnerable without the consistent presence of their caregivers. In this study, the HRV pattern was calculated as high coherence, medium coherence, or low coherence. According to Thurber et al, heart rhythm coherence ""is experienced as a calm, balanced, yet energized and responsive state that is conducive to everyday functioning and interaction, including the performance of tasks requiring mental acuity, focus, problem solving and decision making, as well as physical activity and coordination.""(1(p39)) In the HeartMath program, there was a game in which high coherence was rewarded with a rainbow that dropped coins into a vessel. When coherence was low, the rainbow and coins disappeared until coherence was reached again. We measured HRV using a finger or ear sensor in individual sessions using a computer-based program from HeartMath Institute, Boulder Creek, California. After juvenile offenders overcame their initial fear of being hooked up to a potential lie detector, I instructed them in ""Quick Coherence""(1) and asked them to imagine breathing into the area of their heart. The participants created a library of positive feelings, thoughts, and memories on which they could focus. After a period of positive focus and rhythmic breathing, the clients were often able to move into medium or high coherence. In this state, they noticed that they felt calmer. I explained that they could use this tool to improve their mood. I also practiced alongside the youths in order to demonstrate the technique. The detained youths learned quickly, requested repeated sessions, and learned to combine breathing with recalling the good people, places, foods, and feelings in their lives that sustained them. We could also decrease coherence through the use of negative words such as ""loss of privileges"" on their side or ""pay cut"" on mine and then move back to coherence with suggestions of positive mental images.",doi,10.7453/gahmj.2014.007,pubmed,Global advances in health and medicine,"Lutz, Barbara",2014,NA,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Anaerobic Work Capacity In Elite Wheelchair Athletes,"To study the anaerobic work capacity in wheelchair athletes, 67 elite wheelchair athletes (50 male) were studied in a 30-second sprint test on a computer-controlled wheelchair ergometer during the World Championships and Games for the Disabled in Assen (1990). The experimental set-up (ergometer, protocol) proved to be adequate in terms of power output (P30, P5) velocity and heart rate. Male and female athletes were comparable with respect to personal characteristics (age, body weight, training hours). Track athletes (classified in 4 different functional classes) showed a class-related mean power output (P30: mean power produced during the 30-second sprint period) of 23, 68, 100, and 138 W for the male athletes (n = 38) and 38, 77, and 76 W for females in the upper three classes (n = 10). Sprint power was low for the group of subjects with cerebral palsy (35 W; mixed, n = 6) and relatively high for the amputee group (121 W; mixed, n = 6), female basketball players (81 W; n = 5), and two male field athletes (110 W). Significant differences between male and female athletes were found for P30 and P5 (highest mean power output over any of the six 5-second periods). As was to be expected, mean maximum heart rate in the sprint test varied significantly between the track groups from 112 (high lesion group) to 171 beats/minute-1 (low lesion group) but not for both genders. The lower P30 in the T1 and T2 groups must be explained not only by the reduced functional muscle mass and impaired coordination but also by phenomena of cardiovascular dysfunction. Based on the performance parameters, the functional classification of the track athletes into four groups seems adequate. P30 was significantly associated with the personal characteristics of gender and hours of training. A significant correlation was found between P30 and sprint performance times for 200 meters (r = -0.79). No correlation was found between either of the forms of power output and the marathon times. Anaerobic wheelchair work capacity can be adequately studied with the 30-second sprint test that was used in this study. Anaerobic work capacity is highly variable among elite wheelchair athletes with different disabilities and from different sports disciplines and appeared quite strongly influenced by functionality, hours of training, and gender.To study the anaerobic work capacity in wheelchair athletes, 67 elite wheelchair athletes were studied in a 30-second sprint test on a computer-controlled wheelchair ergometer. Male and female athletes were comparable with respect to personal characteristics. Track athletes showed a class-related mean power output of 23, 68, 100, and 138 W for male athletes and 38, 77, and 76 W for female in the upper three classes.

,Analysis And Evaluation Of Incentive Mechanisms In P2p Networks: A Spatial Evolutionary Game Theory Perspective,"Summary In peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, contributions are made by peers voluntarily for the autonomous character of peers. However, selfish peers may refuse to be cooperative when considering their limited transmission resources. Incentive mechanisms are always used to guarantee successful cooperations among peers. Although the inventive mechanisms have been widely investigated on the basis of game theory, most researches assume that peers are well mixed in the network, regardless of the influence of peers' transaction relationships. In this paper, a novel analysis framework based on spatial evolutionary game theory is proposed to verify the effectiveness of incentive mechanisms. In the framework, a transaction overlay network is used to model the transaction relationships of peers. The transactions between clients and servers are modeled as the donor-recipient game to satisfy their asymmetric characters. Influences of the learning noise and some common behaviors of peers on incentive mechanisms are also considered. Moreover, in order to demonstrate the utility of the framework, a reciprocation-based incentive mechanism, which considers the requestors' behaviors of providing and consuming services, is thoroughly investigated under the framework in scenarios with homogeneous and heterogeneous benefits of services. By using the framework, besides the effectiveness of incentive mechanisms, the detailed spatiotemporal evolutions of peers' strategies driven by incentive mechanisms can also be obtained.

,Ant Colony Intelligence In Multi-Agent Dynamic Manufacturing Scheduling,"This study aims at building an efficient agent-based dynamic scheduling for real-world manufacturing systems with various products, processes, and disturbances. Ant colony intelligence (ACI) is proposed to be combined with local agent coordination so as to make autonomous agents adaptive to changing circumstances and to give rise to efficient global performance. The work here differs from other dynamic scheduling research in two areas: (1) a more generic and realistic manufacturing model with multiple product types, multiple/parallel multi-purpose machines with sequence-dependent setup constraints, and various dynamic disturbances is used, (2) ACI integrated with both machine agents and job agents to solve not only the task allocation problem, but also the task sequencing problem. The implementation of the aforementioned issues in a multi-agent system (MAS) is discussed. Simulation results show that, for most of the performance measures, a MAS integrated with well-designed ant-inspired coordination performs well compared to a MAS using dispatching rules. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

,Anxiety Induction In Virtual Environments: An Experimental Comparison Of Three General Techniques,"Anxiety induction and elicitation of associated physiological arousal with virtual environments (VEs) is important in diverse domains. This paper evaluates three general anxiety induction techniques. The first augments the VE with a health bar that is often displayed in video games to indicate when the user's avatar gets hurt. The second augments the VE with aversive audio-visual stimuli, which are employed in first-person shooter games when the user's avatar gets hurt and include preset heartbeat sound. The third introduces in the previous technique a biofeedback mechanism to control heartbeat sound. The results we obtained on a VE that reproduces a fire evacuation indicate that the third technique produces much higher physiological arousal than the other two, and measures of users' state anxiety are consistent with physiological results. We discuss possible reasons that could explain why the exploitation of auditory heartbeat biofeedback contributes to make the third technique more effective, by linking our study to research and theories of affect and emotions. © The Author 2013.

,Are Digital Games Perceived As Fun Or Danger? Supporting And Suppressing Different Game-Related Concepts,"Violent digital game play has repeatedly been discussed to be strongly related to aggression and emotional instability. Thus, digital game players have to defend against these prejudices through emphasizing positive game-related concepts such as achievement, social interaction, and immersion. We experimentally investigated which positive- and negative-concept players and nonplayers activate when being primed with digital games. Participants were either exposed to violent or nonviolent game content and were required to work on a lexical decision task. Results showed that response latencies for the concept aggression and emotional instability were faster than for neutral concepts (not associated with digital games), but slower than for the positive concepts sociality and competition. Both players and nonplayers felt the need to defend against prejudices and emphasized positive concepts. Neither their own gaming experience nor the game content influenced the results. Being a part of the net generation is sufficient to suppress negative game-related concepts and to support positive game-related concepts to protect digital games as common leisure activity among peers. © Copyright 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2012.",doi,10.1089/cyber.2012.0171,Scopus,"Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking","Kneer J., Glock S., Beskes S., Bente G.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Assessing Users’ Emotion At Interaction Time: A Multimodal Approach With Multiple Sensors,"Users’ emotional states influence decision making and are essential for the knowledge and explanation of users’ behavior with computer applications. However, collecting emotional states during the interaction time with users is a onerous task because it requires very careful handling of the empirical observation, leading researchers to carry out assessments of emotional responses only at the end of the interaction. This paper reports our research in assessing users’ behavior at interaction time and also describes the results of a case study which analyzed users’ emotional responses while interacting with a game. We argue that capturing emotions during interaction time can help us in making changes on users’ behavior (e.g., changing from stressed to a less stressed state) or even suggesting an user to have a break. This can be all possible if both (1) emotions are captured during interaction and (2) changes are suggested at runtime (e.g., through persuasion). The results of this study suggest that there are significant differences between emotional responses captured during the interaction and those declared at the end. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",doi,10.1007/s00500-016-2115-0,Scopus,Soft Computing,"Gonçalves V.P., Giancristofaro G.T., Filho G.P.R., Johnson T., Carvalho V., Pessin G., Neris V.P.A., Ueyama J.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Assessment Of Fun In Interactive Systems: A Survey,"Fun is fundamental in life, since it fosters interaction and learning. But the design of fun is not trivial since it is subjective: it depends upon context, preferences and the history of users. That is why assessment is an important issue in the design process. Traditional assessment methods involve observation and inquiring of users while interacting, while more recent methods involve data collection and physiological measurements. This article presents a survey on the existing methods for the assessment of fun from its constituent elements – attention, flow, immersion and emotion. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",doi,10.1016/j.cogsys.2016.09.007,Scopus,Cognitive Systems Research,"Vieira L.C., da Silva F.S.C.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Assessment Of Learners' Motivation During Interactions With Serious Games: A Study Of Some Motivational Strategies In Food-Force,"This study investigated motivational strategies and the assessment of learners' motivation during serious gameplay. Identifying and intelligently assessing the effects that these strategies may have on learners are particularly relevant for educational computer-based systems. We proposed, therefore, the use of physiological sensors, namely, heart rate, skin conductance, and electroencephalogram (EEG), as well as a theoretical model of motivation (Keller's ARCS model) to evaluate six motivational strategies selected from a serious game called Food-Force. Results from nonparametric tests and logistic regressions supported the hypothesis that physiological patterns and their evolution are suitable tools to directly and reliably assess the effects of selected strategies on learners' motivation. They showed that specific EEG ""attention ratio"" was a significant predictor of learners' motivation and could relevantly evaluate motivational strategies, especially those associated with the Attention and Confidence categories of the ARCS model of motivation. Serious games and intelligent systems can greatly benefit from using these results to enhance and adapt their interventions. © 2012 Lotfi Derbali and Claude Frasson.",doi,10.1155/2012/624538,Scopus,Advances in Human-Computer Interaction,"Derbali L., Frasson C.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Asthma And Physical Activity In Multiracial Girls From Three Us Sites,"Objective: Studies comparing physical activity levels in children with and without asthma have had mixed results. Our objective was to investigate the association between asthma diagnosis and physical activity and to examine differences in these associations by race/ethnicity, weight status and caregiver education. Methods: We investigated the association between asthma (defined as report of physician-diagnosed asthma with at least one asthma related symptom) and measures of physical and sedentary activity in a study of 6- to 8-year-old girls in the Breast Cancer and the Environment Research Project. We compared reported activity and pedometer measurements among girls with and without asthma, and examined modification of these associations by race/ethnicity, weight status and caregiver education. Results: Girls (n=1182) were included with 33.5% White, 4.8% Asian, 30.6% non Hispanic Black and 30.7% Hispanic. Asthma was present in 16.2% of girls. Overall, 38% of girls reported no participation in organized recreational activities and 58% had >2h/day of television, video game and computer time combined. Girls with asthma whose parents were less educated reported fewer pedometer steps and less non-scheduled activity than girls without asthma with similar caregiver education level. Among girls with asthma, those on a controller medication had higher levels of sedentary activity and more structured physical activity but were less likely to report high intensity physical activity. Conclusions: Among girls whose parents are less educated, girls with asthma may have lower physical activity levels than girls without asthma. Use of a controller medication may be related to physical and sedentary activity. © 2014 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.",doi,10.3109/02770903.2013.853081,Scopus,Journal of Asthma,"Vangeepuram N., Mcgovern K.J., Teitelbaum S., Galvez M.P., Pinney S.M., Biro F.M., Kushi L.H., Wolff M.S.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Attention To Emotional Tone Of Voice In Speech Perception In Children With Autism,"A video game was developed to assess speech perception in 13 children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and 13 children with typical development (TYP), ages 5-17 years old. Children listened to pre-recorded sentences varying in content (e.g., ""Bob parked a van"" vs. ""Tim shut a door"") and prosody (i.e., enthusiastic vs. grouchy tone of voice). During training, children learned to select one of two sentences differing in both content and prosody (e.g., enthusiastic ""Bob parked a van"" vs. grouchy ""Tim shut a door""). At testing, children listened to test probes comprising re-combinations of the content and prosodic features of the training sentences. Testing indicated that both groups showed accurate discrimination of the training sentences from the re-combined test probes. However, whereas TYP children showed a preference to select the sentence with enthusiastic prosody over its grouchy counterpart, children with ASD did not. Thus, children with ASD show atypical attention to emotional tone of voice, even though they show no deficit in perceiving prosody. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

,Attentional Bias To Pain And Social Threat In Pediatric Patients With Functional Abdominal Pain And Pain-Free Youth Before And After Performance Evaluation,"This study investigated attentional biases for pain and social threat versus neutral stimuli in 54 youth with functional abdominal pain (FAP) and 53 healthy control subjects (ages 10 to 16 years). We assessed attentional bias using a visual probe detection task (PDT) that presented pain and social threat words in comparison to neutral words at conscious (1250 ms) and preconscious (20 ms) presentation rates. We administered the PDT before and after random assignment of participants to a laboratory stressor - failure versus success feedback regarding their performance on a challenging computer game. All analyses controlled for trait anxiety. At the conscious rate of stimulus presentation, FAP patients exhibited preferential attention toward pain compared with neutral stimuli and compared with the control group. FAP patients maintained preferential attention toward conscious pain stimuli after performance feedback in both failure and success conditions. At the preconscious rate of stimulus presentation, FAP patients' attention was neutral at baseline but increased significantly toward pain stimuli after performance feedback in both failure and success conditions. FAP patients' somatic symptoms increased in both failure and success conditions; control youth's somatic symptoms only increased after failure. Regarding social threat, neither FAP nor control youth exhibited attentional bias toward social threat compared with neutral stimuli at baseline, but both FAP and control youth in the failure condition significantly increased attention away from social threat after failure feedback. Results suggest that FAP patients preferentially attend to pain stimuli in conscious awareness. Moreover, performance evaluation may activate their preconscious attention to pain stimuli. Patients with functional abdominal pain preferentially attended to pain stimuli in conscious awareness. After performance evaluation, they also attended to pain stimuli in preconscious awareness. © 2011 International Association for the Study of Pain. Published by Elsevier B.V.

,Automatic Recognition Of Boredom In Video Games Using Novel Biosignal Moment-Based Features,"This paper presents work conducted toward the biosignals-based automatic recognition of boredom, induced during video-game playing. For this purpose, common biosignal feature extraction methods were exploited and their capability to identify boredom was assessed. Moreover, for the first time, Legendre and Krawtchouk moments, as well as novel moment variations, were extracted as biosignal features and their potential toward automatic affect recognition was examined using the specific application scenario. The present analysis was conducted with ECG and GSR data collected from 19 different subjects, while boredom was naturally induced during the repetitive playing of a 3D video game. Conventional biosignal features as well as moment-based ones were found to be effective for the automatic recognition of boredom by achieving classification accuracies around 85 percent. Then, the joint use of moments and moment variations with conventional features was found to significantly improve classification accuracy by producing a maximum correct classification ratio of 94.17 percent. © 2011 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/T-AFFC.2011.4,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing,"Giakoumis D., Tzovaras D., Moustakas K., Hassapis G.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas

,Autonomous Vehicle-Target Assignment: A Game-Theoretical Formulation,"We consider an autonomous vehicle-target assignment problem where a group of vehicles are expected to optimally assign themselves to a set of targets. We introduce a gametheoretical formulation of the problem in which the vehicles are viewed as self-interested decision makers. Thus, we seek the optimization of a global utility function through autonomous vehicles that are capable of making individually rational decisions to optimize their own utility functions. The first important aspect of the problem is to choose the utility functions of the vehicles in such a way that the objectives of the vehicles are localized to each vehicle yet aligned with a global utility function. The second important aspect of the problem is to equip the vehicles with an appropriate negotiation mechanism by which each vehicle pursues the optimization of its own utility function. We present several design procedures and accompanying caveats for vehicle utility design. We present two new negotiation mechanisms, namely, ""generalized regret monitoring with fading memory and inertia"" and ""selective spatial adaptive play,"" and provide accompanying proofs of their convergence. Finally, we present simulations that illustrate howvehicle negotiations can consistently lead to near-optimal assignments provided that the utilities of the vehicles are designed appropriately.

,Bargaining Models Of Depression And Evolution Of Cooperation,"This paper presents a model for evolutionary origins of unipolar depressive disorders and reviews empirical evidence in support of the ""nonparticipation hypothesis of depression"" suggested by the model. In line with previous theory, depression is interpreted to provide means for not participating in joint enterprises that would otherwise be difficult to avoid ('bargaining' model); therefore, it provides an additional alternative strategy to social-imitation dynamics occurring in Public Good Games. Average income from joint enterprises modeled with a Public Good Game is interpreted to drive group-level genetic selection. Based on these assumptions, it is shown that if a joint enterprise is sufficiently important for both the between-individual and the between-groups competition, then a nonparticipation strategy (or gene for depression vulnerability) will be present in total population almost surely (i.e., with probability one). The modeling framework serves to explain several other seemingly unrelated empirical observations, such as association between income inequality and depression, co-morbidity and proximal biological mechanisms for negative emotions, and mechanisms for the social network-dynamics of emotion. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.jtbi.2013.04.012,Scopus,Journal of Theoretical Biology,Rosenström T.,2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Behaviour Based On Decision Matrices For A Coordination Between Agents In A Urban Traffic Simulation,"This paper describes a multi-agent coordination mechanism applied to intersection simulation situations. In a goal of urban traffic simulation, we must consider the dynamic interactions between autonomous vehicles. The field of multi-agent systems provides us some studies for such systems, in particular on the coordination mechanisms. Conflicts between vehicles (i.e. agents) are very frequent in such applications, and they may cause deadlocks, particularly at intersections such as crossroads. Our approach is based on the solving of two player games/decision matrices which characterize three basic situations. An aggregation method generalizes to n-player games for complex crossroads. The objective of this approach consists in searching basic two-player matrices for solving n-agent problems. To explain the principle, we describe our approach for a particular case of crossroad with three agents. Finally, the obtained results have been examined via a tool of road traffic simulation, ARCHISIM. We assume also that the global traffic replicates the behavior of agents in different situations. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",doi,10.1007/s10489-007-0045-3,Scopus,Applied Intelligence,"Mandiau R., Champion A., Auberlet J.-M., Espié S., Kolski C.",2008,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Behaviourally Rich Actions For User-Controlled Characters,"The increasing use of animated characters and avatars in computer games and 3D online worlds requires increasingly complex behaviour with increasingly simple and easy to use control systems. This paper presents a system for user-controlled actions that aims at simplicity and ease of use while being enhanced by modern animation techniques to produce rich and complex behaviour. We use inverse kinematics based motion adaptation to make pre-existing pieces of motion apply to new targets. The expressiveness of the character is enhanced by adding autonomous behaviour, in this case eye gaze behaviour. This behaviour is generated autonomously but is still influenced by the actions that the user is requesting the character to perform. The actions themselves are simple for a designer with no programming experience to design and for an end user to customise. They are also very simple to invoke. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

,Better Birth Through Games: The Design Of The Prepared Partner And Digital Birth,"Childbirth is a complex and multidimensional experience for the mother, riddled with unforgettable emotions and sensations. In today's cultural climate in California, a mother's primary attendant for social support throughout labor is usually her partner. Preparing the partner is an integral step to making sure that the mother is well-supported in her birth. Because the mother's experience is influenced by the support she receives, and because birth partners need more support than is recognized, the author targets birth partners with a learning intervention. The author investigates video games as a vehicle for knowledge transfer to the birth partner, both as currently available and as a positive learning tool. To address the problem of limited access to childbirth preparation methods, especially for under-served Californians, the author investigated, designed, created, and evaluated two tools: The Prepared Partner and Digital Birth. The Prepared Partner is an online Flash game, and Digital Birth is a free iPhone application that is still undergoing revision and testing. Both games allow the user to practice various supportive actions in the realm of childbirth support for a mother in labor. The author found that players met the learning goals due to The Prepared Partner, and answered positively on the survey questions about their enjoyment of the game.

,"Beyond The Lab: Investigating Early Adolescents' Cognitive, Emotional, And Arousal Responses To Violent Games","Cognitive, emotional, and arousal responses to violent games play a central role in theoretical explanations of how violent media may affect aggression. However, existing research has focused on a relatively narrow range of responses to violent games in experimental settings. This limits our understanding of whether and how violent game-induced responses relate to aggression in real life. To address these gaps, this study investigated how cognitive effort, emotional valence, and arousal in response to violent games relate to early adolescents' aggression, both cross-sectionally and over a period of one year. In addition, we investigated how a social context variable (i.e., family conflict) predicts these responses to violent games and subsequent aggression. A sample of 448 early adolescents (10-14 years) completed survey questions and media diaries that measured their responses to violent games. Results showed that, outside the lab, a positive cross-sectional relationship between violent game-induced arousal and aggression exists. In addition, arousal mediated the relationship between family conflict and aggression. Study findings justify increased research attention to media responses outside the lab and a need for further theoretical and methodological refinement. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

,Bidding Algorithms For Simultaneous Auctions: A Case Study,"This paper describes RoxyBot, one of the top-scoring agents in the First International Trading Agent Competition, TAC-2000. A TAC agent simulates one vision of future travel agents: it represents a set of clients in simultaneous auctions, trading complementary (e.g., airline tickets and hotel reservations) and substitutable (e.g., symphony and theater tickets) goods. RoxyBot faced two key technical challenges in TAC: (i) allocation - - assigning purchased goods to clients at the end of a game instance so as to maximize total client utility, and (ii) completion - - determining the optimal quantity of each resource to buy and sell given client preferences, current holdings, and market prices. For the dimensions of TAC, an optimal solution to the allocation problem is tractable, and RoxyBot uses a search algorithm based on A* to produce optimal allocations. An optimal solution to the completion problem is also tractable, but in the interest of minimizing bidding cycle time, RoxyBot solves the completion problem using beam search with a greedy heuristic, producing approximately optimal completions. RoxyBot's completer relies on an innovative data structure called a priceline. © 2005 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.",doi,10.1007/s10458-004-6975-9,Scopus,Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems,"Greenwald A., Boyan J.",2005,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,"Biofeedback Vs. Video Games: Effects On Impulsivity, Locus Of Control And Self‐Concept With Incarcerated Juveniles","Research has found hyperactivity, poor impulse control, impaired sustained attention and low self‐concept to be behavioral deficits common to juvenile delinquents. Limited opportunities for exercising self‐control while incarcerated may encourage helplessness. If biofeedback training enhances self‐regulation skills, then perhaps these behaviors can be taught in confinement. A sample of 12 felonious juvenile residents (aged 15–18) from a highly restricted environment were assigned randomly to a biofeedback or video game group and trained for 10 half‐hour sessions. Results indicated virtually no significant differences between biofeedback and video game training. However, pre and post differences for both groups combined demonstrated significant gains in impulsivity, EMG, and self‐concept. Both groups rated themselves equally on self‐control ability, regardless of training. Further comparisons between other institutionalized residents (N = 14) and staff counselors (N = 10) as non‐treatment controls were made. On each measure, both training groups improved consistently and became more like their less restricted counterparts.

,Blood Pressure Changes During The Game Of Squash,"The extent and pattern of the blood pressure response to the playing of squash was studied in five healthy volunteers using intra-arterial blood pressure recordings. Systolic pressure increased more than diastolic, but by only 18% of basal, peaking 5.2 ± 2.3 min into the game (mean game duration 49 ±4 min). Thereafter there was a progressive decline, with reducing pulse pressure towards basal. There was a marked and significant increase in beat-by-beat blood pressure variability (P&lt;0.01) and systolic peaks of up to 200mmHg were recorded. A peak heart rate of 171 ±25 beats min-1 occurred at 20 min. These findings do not support the concept of a disproportionate and prolonged pressor response induced by playing squash. The possibility of high single-beat systolic peaks still justifies some caution in subjects at risk of arterial rupture. © 1992 The European Society of Cardiology.",doi,10.1093/oxfordjournals.eurheartj.a060318,Scopus,European Heart Journal,"Brigden G.S., Hughes L.O., Broadhurst P., Raftery E.B.",1992,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Blood Pressure Reactivity To Psychological Stress In Young Adults And Cognition In Midlife: The Coronary Artery Risk Development In Young Adults (Cardia) Study,"Background-The classic view of blood pressure (BP) reactivity to psychological stress in relation to cardiovascular risks assumes that excess reactivity is worse and lower reactivity is better. Evidence addressing how stress-induced BP reactivity in young adults is associated with midlife cognitive function is sparse. Methods and Results-We assessed BP reactivity during a star tracing task and a video game in adults aged 20 to 32 years. Twenty-three years later, cognitive function was assessed with use of the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (a psychomotor speed test), the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (a verbal memory test), and the modified Stroop test (an executive function test). At the time of follow-up, participants (n=3021) had a mean age of 50.2 years; 56% were women, and 44% were black. In linear regression models adjusted for demographic and clinical characteristics including baseline and follow-up resting BP, lower systolic BP (SBP) reactivity during the star tracing and video game was associated with worse Digit Symbol Substitution Test scores (b [SE]: 0.11 [0.02] and 0.05 [0.02], respectively) and worse performance on the Stroop test (b [SE]: -0.06 [0.02] and -0.05 [0.02]; all P>0.01). SBP reactivity was more consistently associated than diastolic BP reactivity with cognitive function scores. The associations between SBP reactivity and cognitive function were mostly similar between blacks and whites. Conclusions-Lower psychological stress-induced SBP reactivity in younger adults was associated with lower cognitive function in midlife. BP reactivity to psychological stressors may have different associations with target organs in hypertension. © 2016 The Authors.",doi,10.1161/JAHA.115.002891,Scopus,Journal of the American Heart Association,"Yano Y., Ning H., Reis J.P., Lewis C.E., Launer L.J., Bryan R.N., Yaffe K., Sidney S., Albanese E., Greenland P., Lloyd-Jones D., Liu K.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Brave New World Of Warcraft: A Conceptual Framework For Active Escapism,"Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the phenomenon of active escapism – a unique form of experiential consumption that engages fantasy and role-play as a means of coping. In contrast with passive forms of escapism, whereby consumers act as observers (e.g. watching a movie), active escapism provides consumers with the opportunity to directly interact with mediated realities, whether constructed in a virtual space (e.g. a video game) or the real world. Design/methodology/approach: Within the context of video game consumption, a conceptual framework for active escapism comprised antecedents, processes and consequences is established through literature review, depth interviews and naturalistic inquiry. Findings: The findings suggest that active escapism functions as a coping mechanism when consumers are confronted with external stressors that threaten either their sense of identity or control. While other forms of emotion-focused coping relieve stress through psychological avoidance (i.e. refocusing of attention away from stressors), active escapism provides the benefits of affirmation and empowerment through projective fantasy (i.e. role-play) and presence (i.e. immersion into a mediated reality). Originality/value: The conceptual framework established by this analysis gives insight into the structure of active escapism as a theoretical construct, providing a foundation for future research. Managerial implications for consumer escapism (e.g. branded in-game content) are discussed. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",doi,10.1108/JCM-04-2016-1775,Scopus,Journal of Consumer Marketing,"Kuo A., Lutz R.J., Hiler J.L.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Building A Pedagogy Around Action And Emotion: Experiences Of Blind Opera Of Kolkata,"Contemporary knowledge systems have given too much importance to visual symbols, the written word for instance, as the repository of knowledge. The primacy of the written word and the representational world built around it is, however, under debate - especially from recent insights derived from cognitive science that seeks to bring back action, intent and emotion within the core of cognitive science (Freeman and Nunez in J Consciousness Stud 6(11/12), 1999). It is being argued that other sensory experiences, apart from the visual, along with desires (or intent) and emotions - like pain, pleasure, sorrow or joy - constitute equally important building blocks that shape an individual's cognition of the world around. This multi-sensory cognition colored by emotions inspire action and hence is valid knowledge. This is probably nowhere more apparent than in the world of the visually impaired. Deprived of visual sensory capability, they have to perforce depend on other senses. But the dominant discourse in wider society plays a major role in determining what they (the blind) can do. A society built around visual symbols and the written word underplays other elements of cognition and in the process undervalues them. This also gets reflected in the construction of social artifacts of various kinds, such as the educational certification system (The Braille system is an attempt to make the written world accessible to the blind through tactile signals'so that words are 'felt' and 'read'. But it is quite cumbersome. For instance, even a blind highly skilled at writing in Braille would not be able to match the writing speed of an ordinary visually endowed literate person. Effective and efficient computer-based voice'text'voice converters might solve this problem better.)-based primarily on skills over the written word. Linguistic ability becomes most valuable and at another level the written word gets salience over the spoken word. The blind hardly has a chance, therefore, except through concessions or piety. A practice built around the imagery of an empowered blind person, therefore, must depart from mainstream conceptualization - for power is derived from what one has rather than from what one lacks. It must begin by tapping and valorizing one's own endowments. This paper is an attempt to identify such a departure based on the experience of Blind Opera - a theatre group of the blind working in Kolkata, India. It seeks to provide an exposition in written word of an experience that can only be partially captured within the confines of a text. It is an incomplete account, therefore, and may be taken as an attempt to reach out and seek an exchange of experiences and insights. © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2006.",doi,10.1007/s00146-006-0038-5,Scopus,AI and Society,"Saha B., Gangopadhyay S.",2007,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Caffeine Administration Does Not Alter Salivary -Amylase Activity In Young Male Daily Caffeine Consumers,"Background: To follow up on a recent report from our lab [Hum Psychopharmacol 25:359-367, 2010.] we examined the effects of caffeine on salivary -amylase (sAA) activity in response to an engaging, non-stressful task in healthy young males (age 18-30 yrs) who consumed caffeine on a daily basis. Using a placebo-controlled, double-blind, between-subjects design, 45 men received either placebo, 200 mg or 400 mg of caffeine (Vivarin®). Participants then rested for 20 minutes, and performed a 20-minute computerized air traffic controller-like task that was cognitively engaging but not stressful. Saliva samples (assayed for sAA and cortisol), blood pressure, and heart rate were taken before (baseline) and 15 minutes after the computerized task. Results: Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and sAA activity increased across the laboratory session (F's > 9.20, p's < 0.05); salivary cortisol levels decreased (F = 16.17, p < 0.05). There were no main effects for caffeine administration on sAA, salivary cortisol, or cardiovascular measures, and caffeine did not interact with the task to alter these measures. Conclusions: Laboratory administered caffeine does not alter sAA activity, even when sAA activity is stimulated by participating in a cognitively engaging task. These data demonstrate that caffeine administration does not affect sAA activity, at least in healthy young men who regularly consume caffeine. Results support recent findings that basal caffeine levels in habitual caffeine users are not associated with basal sAA activity and that daily caffeine intake and diurnal sAA activity are not related. © 2014 Klein et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",doi,10.1186/1756-0500-7-30,Scopus,BMC Research Notes,"Klein L.C., Whetzel C.A., Bennett J.M., Ritter F.E., Nater U.M., Schoelles M.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Can Interface Features Affect Aggression Resulting From Violent Video Game Play? An Examination Of Realistic Controller And Large Screen Size,"Aggressiveness attributed to violent video game play is typically studied as a function of the content features of the game. However, can interface features of the game also affect aggression? Guided by the General Aggression Model (GAM), we examine the controller type (gun replica vs. mouse) and screen size (large vs. small) as key technological aspects that may affect the state aggression of gamers, with spatial presence and arousal as potential mediators. Results from a between-subjects experiment showed that a realistic controller and a large screen display induced greater aggression, presence, and arousal than a conventional mouse and a small screen display, respectively, and confirmed that trait aggression was a significant predictor of gamers' state aggression. Contrary to GAM, however, arousal showed no effects on aggression; instead, presence emerged as a significant mediator. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2013.",doi,10.1089/cyber.2012.0500,Scopus,"Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking","Kim K.J., Sundar S.S.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Can Video Games Enhance Creativity? Effects Of Emotion Generated By Dance Dance Revolution,"What role does emotion play in helping youth reach their creative potential? Does it alter how they process ideas, and how many ideas they can generate? By varying the levels of arousal associated with low, medium, and high levels of exertion in the video game Dance Dance Revolution, and inducing a positive or negative mood, this study offers evidence that emotion significantly affects creativity through the interaction of arousal and valence. Faced with the cognitive demand of creativity, lower arousal levels resulted in higher creativity scores when coupled with a negative mood. At high arousal levels, a positive mood resulted in greater creative potential than a negative mood. These results are discussed here in light of theories of emotion as a prime, as information, and as a moderator of attention. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",doi,10.1080/10400419.2010.503540,Scopus,Creativity Research Journal,"Hutton E., Sundar S.S.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Cardiac Patients Show High Interest In Technology Enabled Cardiovascular Rehabilitation,"Background: Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) can slow or reverse the progression of cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, uptake of community-based CR is very low. E-cardiology, e-health and technology solutions for physical activity uptake and monitoring have evolved rapidly and have potential in CVD management. However, it is unclear what the current technology usage is of CVD patients, and their needs and interests for technology enabled CR. Methods: A technology usage questionnaire was developed and completed by patients from a supervised ambulatory CR program and an adult congenital heart disease clinic and from two community-based CR programs. Results were described and related with age, gender and educational level by Spearman correlations. Results: Of 310 patients, 298 patients (77 % male; mean age 61,7 ± 14,5 years) completed at least 25 questions of the survey and were included in the analysis (completion rate 96 %). Most (97 %) patients had a mobile phone and used the internet (91 %). Heart rate monitors were used by 35 % and 68 % reported to find heart rate monitoring important when exercising at home. Physical activity monitoring was reported by 12 % of the respondents. Respondents were interested in CR support through internet (77 %) and mobile phone (68 %). Many patients reported interest in game-based CR (67 %) and virtual rehabilitation (58 %). At least medium interest in technology enabled CR was reported by 75 % of the patients. Interest decreased with increasing age (r = -0.16; p = 0.005). Conclusions: CVD patients show interest for technology enabled home-based CR. Our results could guide the design of a technology-based, virtual CR intervention. © 2016 The Author(s).",doi,10.1186/s12911-016-0329-9,Scopus,BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making,"Buys R., Claes J., Walsh D., Cornelis N., Moran K., Budts W., Woods C., Cornelissen V.A.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Cardiovascular Reactivity In Black And White Siblings Versus Matched Controls,"Elevated cardiovascular (CV) reactivity may be a marker or mechanism for the early development of essential hypertension (EH) and may contribute to the greater prevalence of EH observed in Black adults. Previous research has demonstrated that Black children show greater CV reactivity than White children to psychological stressors, however, the role of heritability in understanding these racial differences is still unknown. Evidence which supports a genetic influence on CV reactivity comes from animal studies, research on family history of EH, and from twin and sibling studies. The present study expands on previous findings by examining racial differences in CV reactivity in 15 pairs of Black siblings, 15 pairs of age-and sex-matched unrelated Black control subjects, 17 pairs of White siblings, and 17 pairs of age-and sex-matched unrelated White control subjects. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and heart rate (HR) measurements were obtained at rest and during a stress task (competitive video game). Black siblings demonstrated a significantly higher intraclass correlation for DBP reactivity than Black controls or White siblings (r=0.73, versus 0.16, 0.14, respectively). Additionally, Black siblings demonstrated a steeper rise and then a plateau in DBP and HR reactivity to the video game task, while White siblings showed a more gradual increase in these measures over the course of playing three video games. The results for DBP and HR reactivity, however, were not consistent among either of the matched control groups. These results expand on previous research by suggesting a stronger genetic influence of CV reactivity in Black than in White children. © 1995 The Society of Behavioral Medicine.",doi,10.1007/BF02903914,Scopus,Annals of Behavioral Medicine,"Wilson D.K., Holmes S.D., Arheart K., Alpert B.S.",1995,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Cardiovascular Reactivity To A New Mental Stress Test: The Maze Test,"The response to the maze test was studied in 31 subjects on no medication, including seven subjects with mild essential hypertension. Beat-by-beat finger blood pressure (BP) was measured with a Finapres device. Pulse interval from which heart rate (HR) was derived was obtained from the BP signal. A period of 5 min baseline was used to define resting levels of systolic BP and HR using 20-s averaged values for the calculation of the 95% confidence limit of the two variables. The average test duration was 10 min. During this period a series of video-displayed mazes had to be solved with easy mazes preceding difficult ones. No subject had been exposed to the test before. The maximal BP elevation associated with the test was 27 mmHg. The HR response averaged 11 beats/min. Significant elevations were observed for half the test duration. No significant relationship between these two responses was observed and some subjects exhibited isolated systolic BP or HR responses. When indices obtained during this active mental stress were compared to resting values, positive correlations were observed. When the resting standard deviation (SD) of systolic BP was higher the systolic response was greater. A similar relationship was observed for HR. In addition, when the systolic BP level at rest was higher, the systolic BP reactivity index was greater. However, systolic BP or HR at baseline were not predictive of the systolic BP or HR responses. This study demonstrates the applicability of a new test to assess cardiovascular reactivity. The main advantage of non-invasive continuous BP measurement with the Finapres is the ability to provide variability indices in addition to the peak responses. © 1995 Rapid Science Publishers.",doi,10.1007/BF01826196,Scopus,Clinical Autonomic Research,"Mounier-Vehier C., Girard A., Consoli S., Laude D., Vacheron A., Elghozi J.-L.",1995,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Cardiovascular Reactivity To Psychological Stress In Healthy Children,"Cardiovascular reactivity to stress has been implicated as a marker and/or mechanism in the development of cardiovascular disease. No normative data exist to classify children's reactivity to psychological stress. This investigation presents normative percentile data on the hemodynamic responses (heart rate and blood pressure) of 310 healthy, black or white, children between the ages of 6 and 18 years to the stress of a television video game. A series of three video games, played under three increasing levels of stress, elicited progressively higher values of blood pressure and heart rate. Both the child's race and gender, as well as the experimenter's race, significantly affected reactivity. Children demonstrated a wide range of interchild reactivity, thus allowing separation of individuals into high and low risk percentile groups. Copyright © 1988, Wiley Blackwell.

,Cardiovascular Responses To An Extended Aversive Video Game Task,"Active coping stressors, which tend to produce increases in cardiac output disproportionate to metabolic need, may elicit compensatory autoregulatory responses elevating peripheral resistance if exposure is prolonged. Two studies (total N=24) were conducted in which healthy male undergraduates participated in both one‐hour shock avoidance and separate counterbalanced baseline sessions. In an attempt to maximize subject involvement, a somewhat unconventional, complex shock avoidance procedure was employed. The subject could avoid mild electric shocks depending on video game performance. The primary dependent measures were heart rate, digital blood volume pulse (DBVP), and blood pressure. In both studies, most subjects exhibited immediate and pronounced increases in heart rate in response to the stressor, followed by some habituation. In contrast, DBVP responses did not usually habituate. Similarly, blood pressure was more or less constantly elevated by the stressor. The results of multiple regression analyses indicated that individual differences in mean arterial blood pressure response to the stressor were significantly related to individual differences in heart rate response to the first 15 minutes, but increasingly unrelated to heart rate response, and more related to DBVP response, as the session progressed.

,Causal Effects Of Violent Sports Video Games On Aggression: Is It Competitiveness Or Violent Content?,"Three experiments examined the impact of excessive violence in sport video games on aggression-related variables. Participants played either a nonviolent simulation-based sports video game (baseball or football) or a matched excessively violent sports video game. Participants then completed measures assessing aggressive cognitions (Experiment 1), aggressive affect and attitudes towards violence in sports (Experiment 2), or aggressive behavior (Experiment 3). Playing an excessively violent sports video game increased aggressive affect, aggressive cognition, aggressive behavior, and attitudes towards violence in sports. Because all games were competitive, these findings indicate that violent content uniquely leads to increases in several aggression-related variables, as predicted by the General Aggression Model and related social–cognitive models.",doi,10.1016/j.jesp.2009.04.019,anderson2010,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,"Anderson, C.

,Changes In Hemodynamic Response To Mental Stress With Heart Rate Feedback Training,"This study was designed to examine underlying hemodynamic changes that accompany observed reductions in heart rate (HR) response to mental stress following HR feedback training. Twenty-five college males, assigned to either a HR feedback training group (FB+) or a control group (FB-), were presented with a videogame and mental arithmetic challenge, as HR, blood pressure, and impedance cardiography-derived measures of hemodynamic functioning were recorded. During training, the FB+ group received HR feedback and the FB- group was not provided with HR feedback while playing a videogame. At posttraining, results revealed that the FB+ group exhibited significantly lower HR, systolic blood pressure, stroke volume, and total peripheral resistance responses to the videogame compared to that at pretraining. There was no evidence that the acquired skills generalized to a mental arithmetic task. These results suggest that HR feedback training is an effective method for reducing cardiovascular and hemodynamic responses to a mental stressor; however, the generalizability of this effect remains questionable.",doi,10.1023/A:1013101820240,Scopus,Applied Psychophysiology Biofeedback,"Goodie J.L., Larkin K.T.",2001,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,"Children's Emotional Experience Of Peer Provocation: The Relation Between Observed Behaviour And Self-Reports Of Emotions, Expressions, And Social Goals","For an experimental study of children's responses to peer provocation, this investigation examined the correlations between children's observed behaviours and their self-reports of their emotional experiences, expressions, and social goals provided in an interview immediately following the provocation. Participants were 565 children (approximate ages 8, 10, and 12 years old) who were provoked in two ways in an experimental play session: By losing at a computer game they were playing for a desirable prize, and by being taunted by a peer actor. Children's responses to provocation were reliably coded for verbalisations, facial expressions, and gestures. Results indicated often significant but quite modest correlations between children's self-reports of their emotional behaviour and their behaviours as coded during the play session. For the magnitude of these correlations, there were not significant developmental differences, and the strength of the correlations did not differ for same-or for other-gender dyads. There was some evidence that for girls, self-reports corresponded to emotional behaviours more strongly than for boys.",doi,10.1080/01650250143000085,Scopus,International Journal of Behavioral Development,"Underwood M.K., Bjornstad G.J.",2001,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Client-Server Games And Their Equilibria In Peer-To-Peer Networks,"In peer-to-peer networks, each peer acts simultaneously as client and server, by issuing and satisfying content requests respectively. In this work, we use concepts from non-cooperative game theory to model the interaction of autonomous peers. The client strategy set consists of feasible request load splits towards servers, while the server strategy set is formed out of possible service disciplines on received requests. The performance metric of interest is the average retrieval delay of content requests. First, we assume preassigned fixed server policies (FIFO and priority) and study the emerging client request load splitting game. Peers are either egotistic (i.e. interested only in optimizing their own delay) or altruistic ones that also take into account delay incurred to other peers. We consider best response updates to model iterative peer interaction. For egotistic peers, we show that the sequence of best responses always converges to the unique Nash Equilibrium Point (NEP). For altruistic peers best response updates converge to one of the multiple NEPs exist, with each one being a global optimum for the FIFO case and a local optimum for any other service strategy profile. We also consider mixed swarms consisting of both egotistic and (partially-) altruistic peers and show an interesting transition from one to multiple NEPs. Next, we include service strategies in the peer strategy set. Though with its service policy a peer cannot directly affect its delay, it can affect the resulting NEP. We devise two-level game models, where, at a first level, a peer selects its favorable service rule and then peers play a client load splitting game. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

,Coalition-Based Resource Negotiation For Multimedia Applications In Informationally Decentralized Networks,"Designing efficient and fair solutions for dividing the network resources in a distributed manner among self-interested multimedia users is recently becoming an important research topic because heterogeneous and high bandwidth multimedia applications (users), having different quality-of-service requirements, are sharing the same network. Suitable resource negotiation solutions need to explicitly consider the amount of information exchanged among the users and the computational complexity incurred by the users. In this paper, we propose decentralized solutions for resource negotiation, where multiple autonomous users self-organize into a coalition which shares the same network resources and negotiate the division of these resources by exchanging information about their requirements. We then discuss various resource sharing strategies that the users can deploy based on their exchanged information. Several of these strategies are designed to explicitly consider the utility (i.e., video quality) impact of multimedia applications. In order to quantify the utility benefit derived by exchanging different information, we define a new metric, which we refer to as the value of information. We quantify through simulations the improvements that can be achieved when various information is exchanged between users, and discuss the required complexity at the user side involved in implementing the various resource negotiation strategies. © 2009 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TMM.2009.2017638,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Multimedia,"Park H., Van Der Schaar M.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,"Cognitive, Emotional, And Behavioral Determinants Involved In The Use Of Video Games: Towards A Better Understanding Of Excessive Gaming For Cbt Interventions","Summary Studies on excessive video game use rarely focus on cognitive, emotional, and behavioral experience of video game players. CBTs for pathological gambling accurately address the cognitive processes of gamblers, but the typical functionings of video game players are not widely discussed in video game addiction CBT. This study clarifies these variables through content analysis of individual interviews conducted with frequent and/or excessive video game players. These players are characterized by high weekly gaming time (WGT), numerous years of playing practice and a PVP's score (Problem Video Game Playing Questionnaire) significantly correlated to WGT. These interviews focus on five key moments of the game: ""Before"", ""During"" and ""After"" the game, and when ""Winning"" or ""Losing"". A wide range of video games is taken into account both online and offline. The results, in conjunction with the existing literature, update variables known to cognitive psychology (various but specific emotions and physical manifestations; anticipatory, relief-oriented and permissive beliefs; attentional resources; etc.) and the dynamic richness of which is demonstrated according to the five playing moments. These specific variables provide a sound basis for studies concerning excessive video games use and for gaming experiences focused CBTs. © 2014 Association française de thérapie comportementale et cognitive.

,Collaborative Sensing In A Distributed Ptz Camera Network,"The performance of dynamic scene algorithms often suffers because of the inability to effectively acquire features on the targets, particularly when they are distributed over a wide field of view. In this paper, we propose an integrated analysis and control framework for a pan, tilt, zoom (PTZ) camera network in order to maximize various scene understanding performance criteria (e.g., tracking accuracy, best shot, and image resolution) through dynamic camera-to-target assignment and efficient feature acquisition. Moreover, we consider the situation where processing is distributed across the network since it is often unrealistic to have all the image data at a central location. In such situations, the cameras, although autonomous, must collaborate among themselves because each camera's PTZ parameter entails constraints on the others. Motivated by recent work in cooperative control of sensor networks, we propose a distributed optimization strategy, which can be modeled as a game involving the cameras and targets. The cameras gain by reducing the error covariance of the tracked targets or through higher resolution feature acquisition, which, however, comes at the risk of losing the dynamic target. Through the optimization of this reward-versus-risk tradeoff, we are able to control the PTZ parameters of the cameras and assign them to targets dynamically. The tracks, upon which the control algorithm is dependent, are obtained through a consensus estimation algorithm whereby cameras can arrive at a consensus on the state of each target through a negotiation strategy. We analyze the performance of this collaborative sensing strategy in active camera networks in a simulation environment, as well as a real-life camera network. © 2012 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TIP.2012.2188806,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Image Processing,"Ding C., Song B., Morye A., Farrell J.A., Roy-Chowdhury A.K.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Collaborative Virtual Reality Based Advanced Cardiac Life Support Training Simulator Using Virtual Reality Principles,"Background: Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) is a series of team-based, sequential and time constrained interventions, requiring effective communication and coordination of activities that are performed by the care provider team on a patient undergoing cardiac arrest or respiratory failure. The state-of-the-art ACLS training is conducted in a face-to-face environment under expert supervision and suffers from several drawbacks including conflicting care provider schedules and high cost of training equipment. Objective: The major objective of the study is to describe, including the design, implementation, and evaluation of a novel approach of delivering ACLS training to care providers using the proposed virtual reality simulator that can overcome the challenges and drawbacks imposed by the traditional face-to-face training method. Methods: We compare the efficacy and performance outcomes associated with traditional ACLS training with the proposed novel approach of using a virtual reality (VR) based ACLS training simulator. One hundred and forty-eight (148) ACLS certified clinicians, translating into 26 care provider teams, were enrolled for this study. Each team was randomly assigned to one of the three treatment groups: control (traditional ACLS training), persuasive (VR ACLS training with comprehensive feedback components), or minimally persuasive (VR ACLS training with limited feedback components). The teams were tested across two different ACLS procedures that vary in the degree of task complexity: ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia (VFib/VTach) and pulseless electric activity (PEA). Results: The difference in performance between control and persuasive groups was not statistically significant (P= .37 for PEA and P= .1 for VFib/VTach). However, the difference in performance between control and minimally persuasive groups was significant (P= .05 for PEA and P= .02 for VFib/VTach). The pre-post comparison of performances of the groups showed that control (P= .017 for PEA, P= .01 for VFib/VTach) and persuasive (P= .02 for PEA, P= .048 for VFib/VTach) groups improved their performances significantly, whereas minimally persuasive group did not (P= .45 for PEA, P= .46 for VFib/VTach). Results also suggest that the benefit of persuasiveness is constrained by the potentially interruptive nature of these features. Conclusions: Our results indicate that the VR-based ACLS training with proper feedback components can provide a learning experience similar to face-to-face training, and therefore could serve as a more easily accessed supplementary training tool to the traditional ACLS training. Our findings also suggest that the degree of persuasive features in VR environments have to be designed considering the interruptive nature of the feedback elements. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",doi,10.1016/j.jbi.2014.04.005,Scopus,Journal of Biomedical Informatics,"Khanal P., Vankipuram A., Ashby A., Vankipuram M., Gupta A., Drumm-Gurnee D., Josey K., Tinker L., Smith M.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Combining Exergame Training With Omega-3 Fatty Acid Supplementation: Protocol For A Randomized Controlled Study Assessing The Effect On Neuronal Structure/Function In The Elderly Brain,"A common problem in the older population is the risk of falling and related injury, immobility, and reduced survival. Age-related neuronal changes, e.g., decline in gray-and white-matter, affect neuronal, cognitive, and motor functioning. The improvement of these factors might decrease fall events in elderly. Studies showed that administration of video game-based physical exercise, a so-called exergame, or omega-3 fatty acid (FA) may improve motor and/or cognitive functioning through neuronal changes in the brain of older adults. The aim of this study is to assess the effects of a combination of exergame training with omega-3 FA supplementation on the elderly brain. We hypothesize that an intervention using a combination approach differently affects on the neuronal structure and function of the elderly's brain as compared to the sole administration of exergame training. The study is a parallel, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial lasting 26 weeks. Sixty autonomous living, non-smoking, and right-handed healthy older (>65 years) adults who live independently or in a senior residency are included, randomized, and allocated to one of two study groups. The experimental group receives a daily amount of 13.5 ml fish oil (including 2.9 g of omega-3 FA), whereas the control group receives a daily amount of 13.5 ml olive oil for 26 weeks. After 16 weeks, both groups start with an exergame training program three times per week. Measurements are performed on three time-points by treatment blinded investigators: pre-intervention measurements, blood sample after 16 week, and post-intervention measurements. The main outcomes are motor evoked potentials of the right M. tibialis anterior (transcranial magnetic stimulation) and response-related potentials (electroencephalography) during a cognitive test. For secondary outcomes, reaction time during cognitive tests and spatio-temporal parameters during gait performance are measured.

,Combining Popular Game Consoles And Osgi To Investigate Autonomous In-The-Field Biomedical Data Acquisition And Management,"The need and interest in conducting biomedical research outside the traditional laboratory is increasing. In the field testing such as in the participant's home or work environment is a growing consideration when undertaking biomedical investigation. This type of research requires at a minimum semi-autonomous computer systems that collect such data and send it back to the laboratory for processing and dissemination with the smallest amount of attendance by the participant or even the experimenter. A key aspect of supporting this type of research is the selection of the appropriate software and hardware components. These supporting systems need to be reliable, allow considerable customizability and be readily accessible but also able to be locked down. In this paper we report a set of requirements for the hardware and software for such a system. We then utilise these requirements to evaluate the use of game consoles as a hardware platform in comparison to other hardware choices. We finish by outline one particular aspect of the supporting software used to support the chosen hardware platform based on the OSGi framework.",doi,10.2478/v10177-010-0011-6,Scopus,International Journal of Electronics and Telecommunications,"Armstrong C., Kavanagh D., Lal S., Rossiter P.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Comfortably Numb: Desensitizing Effects Of Violent Media On Helping Others.,"Two studies tested the hypothesis that exposure to violent media reduces aid offered to people in pain. In Study 1, participants played a violent or nonviolent video game for 20 min. After game play, while completing a lengthy questionnaire, they heard a loud fight, in which one person was injured, outside the lab. Participants who played violent games took longer to help the injured victim, rated the fight as less serious, and were less likely to “hear” the fight in comparison to participants who played nonviolent games. In Study 2, violent- and nonviolent-movie attendees witnessed a young woman with an injured ankle struggle to pick up her crutches outside the theater either before or after the movie. Participants who had just watched a violent movie took longer to help than participants in the other three conditions. The findings from both studies suggest that violent media make people numb to the pain and suffering of others.",doi,10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02287.x,anderson2010,Psychological Science,"Bushman, B.

,Comparison Of Good Days And Sick Days Of School-Age Children With Cancer Reflected Through Their Drawings,"Purpose: Childhood cancer disrupts children’s daily life experiences. Eliciting children’s perspectives regarding their life experiences during cancer treatment can be challenging. The purpose of this study was to characterize elementary school-age children’s “good days” and “sick days” through their drawings. Methods: This study used draw-and-tell interviews, a developmentally sensitive arts-based technique that supports children’s recall and communication of information, facilitating a deeper understanding of children’s personal interpretation and meaning of a given phenomenon of interest. Children were asked to draw pictures representing both a “good day” and a “sick day.” Following completion of each drawing, research team members used a semi-structured interview guide to elicit children’s explanations of their pictures. Content analysis techniques were used to descriptively characterize children’s drawings followed by thematic analysis to identify commonalities. Results: Participants were 27 children 6.33–12.83 years of age (mean 9.16 years; SD = 1.9) receiving treatment for cancer. “Good day” and “sick day” pictures were similar with regards to the presence of the child, the inclusion of other individuals, and the type of art medium used. Children’s pictures characterized “good days” as being happy, outside in sunny weather, and engaged in activities. In contrast, “sick days” were characterized as feeling sad, lying down or reclining, and experiencing illness-related symptoms. Conclusions: Children’s drawings illustrate their capacity to provide rich personal data related to their “good days” and “sick days.” Incorporating arts-based strategies in the clinical setting may provide a child-centric strategy to understand the child’s perspective and direct interventions. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",doi,10.1007/s11136-017-1621-6,Scopus,Quality of Life Research,"Linder L.A., Bratton H., Nguyen A., Parker K., Phinney S.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Comparison Of Three Distraction Techniques In Reducing Stress In Dental Patients.,"Three types of distraction were investigated in the dental operatory with patients receiving amalgam restorations. The distraction conditions included an audio-comedy program, a video-comedy program, and a video game. The results indicated that both the video comedy and the video game successfully distracted patients during the dental procedure. The data suggest that successful distraction is accompanied by an increase in physiologic arousal. This finding contrasts with earlier reports of the use of relaxation in which a decrease in physiologic arousal occurs during dental procedures. It was suggested that the choice for use of the successful distraction procedures be based on other practical considerations.",doi,10.14219/jada.archive.1984.0034,Scopus,Journal of the American Dental Association (1939),"Seyrek S.K., Corah N.L., Pace L.F.",1984,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Competing And Collaborating Brains: Multi-Brain Computer Interfacing,"In this chapter we survey the possibilities of brain-computer interface applications that assume two or more users, where at least one of the users’ brain activity is used as input to the application. Such ‘applications’ were already explored by artists who introduced artistic EEG applications in the early ‘seventies’ of the previous century. These early explorations were not yet supported by advanced signal process methods, simply because there was no computing support possible, and interest in artistic applications faded until it reappeared in more recent years. Research in neuroscience, signal processing, machine learning and applications in medical, assistive BCIs prevailed. It was supported by computer science that provided real-time and off-line processing to analyze and store large amounts of streaming or collected data. With the possibility to access cheap shared and distributed storage and processing power, as it became available in the last decade of the previous century and the first decade of this century, different kinds of BCI applications, following a general interest in digital games, interactive entertainment and social media, became visible. These are domains where experience, fun and emotions are more important than efficiency, robustness and control. BCI provides user and application with a new modality that can be manipulated and interpreted, in addition to other input modalities. This has been explored, but mostly from the point of view of a single user interacting with an application. In this chapter we look at BCI applications where more than one user is involved. Games are among the possible applications and there are already simple games where gamers compete or collaborate using brain signal information from one or more players. We consider extensions of current applications by looking at different types of multi-user games, including massively multi-player online role-playing games. We mention research —distinguishing between active and passive BCI—on multi-participant BCI in non-game contexts that provides us with information about the possibilities of collaborative and competitive multi-brain games and that allows us to develop a vision on such games. The results of the literature study are collected in a tablewhere we distinguish between the various forms of interaction between players (participants) in collaborative and competitive games and team activities. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",doi,10.1007/978-3-319-10978-7_12,Scopus,Intelligent Systems Reference Library,Nijholt A.,2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas

Subjects could cooperate, compete, punish, reward, or withdraw during each interaction and could send 1 of 55 messages communicating feelings, requests, and intentions between interactions. Paired Type A's interacted more competitively and aggressively than paired Type B's. There were no significant differences between Type A's and Type B's in heart rate or digital vasomotor response during the interpersonal game.

,Complex Decision Making: A Longitudinal Study Of Process And Performance,"Two studies using a computer-simulated, strategy-formulation game and business students were conducted using simultaneous verbal protocols. It was found that a number of information-processing and information-evaluation thought processes were significantly related to game performance. Consistent with what is known about individual decision making, the present results suggest that, for the task used in this study, individuals who engage in causal analysis perform better than those who do not. But those who focus on negative emotions, blindly repeat previously successful decisions, and engage in illogical through processes perform more poorly than those who do not. Causal replication using real managers within organizational settings, however, is needed before firm conclusions can be drawn from this research. © 1985.",doi,10.1016/0749-5978(85)90015-9,Scopus,Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes,"Schweiger D.M., Anderson C.R., Locke E.A.",1985,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,"Component Neural Systems For The Creation Of Emotional Memories During Free Viewing Of A Complex, Real-World Event","To investigate the neural systems that contribute to the formation of complex, self-relevant emotional memories, dedicated fans of rival college basketball teams watched a competitive game while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). During a subsequent recognition memory task, participants were shown video clips depicting plays of the game, stemming either from previously-viewed game segments (targets) or from non-viewed portions of the same game (foils). After an old-new judgment, participants provided emotional valence and intensity ratings of the clips. A data driven approach was first used to decompose the fMRI signal acquired during free viewing of the game into spatially independent components. Correlations were then calculated between the identified components and post-scanning emotion ratings for successfully encoded targets. Two components were correlated with intensity ratings, including temporal lobe regions implicated in memory and emotional functions, such as the hippocampus and amygdala, as well as a midline fronto-cingulo-parietal network implicated in social cognition and self-relevant processing. These data were supported by a general linear model analysis, which revealed additional valence effects in fronto-striatal-insular regions when plays were divided into positive and negative events according to the fan's perspective. Overall, these findings contribute to our understanding of how emotional factors impact distributed neural systems to successfully encode dynamic, personally-relevant event sequences. © 2010 Forstmann, Brown, Dutilh, Neumann and Wagenmakers.",doi,10.3389/fnhum.2010.00034,Scopus,Frontiers in Human Neuroscience,"Botzung A., LaBar K.S., Kragel P., Miles A., Rubin D.C.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Components Of Type A Behavior Pattern As Predictors Of Neuroendocrine And Cardiovascular Reactivity In Challenging Tasks,"This study was designed to test the association between (a) components of the Type A behavior pattern, measured by survey and structured interview (SI), and (b) sympatho-adrenal activation, indexed by urinary catecholamines, pituitary-adrenal responsiveness measured by salivary cortisol, cardiovascular activation measured by heart rate (HR) and pulse transit time (PTT), and renal sodium excretion. Sixteen subjects, balanced for gender, were recruited from a random sample of 100 university students. They presented a stratified distribution of responses to the Jenkins Activity Survey (JAS) for Type A behavior assessment. The subjects volunteered in a challenging laboratory session that included the performance of a video game (Video) and the SI for Type A behavior assessment. Generally, Reactivity and Recovery scores for dopamine (D) and adrenaline (A) were positively correlated with such scores for sodium in particular, and were negatively correlated with salivary changes of cortisol (Table 1). The highest levels of significance for univariate F-tests were obtained from Cardiovascular Reactivity and Recovery measures and for dopamine and adrenaline measures when groups were formed by a median criterion to Global Type A assessed by the SI: Hostility plus Time Urgency. Discriminant analyses of Reactivity variables were most successful in classification of Type A and Type B groups when (a) D, A, noradrenaline (NA), HR, and PTT scores were combined as a discriminant model with SI-scores for Global Type A (Table 2), whereas Recovery scores for cardiovascular, or cardiovascular plus catecholamine variables, related to the Global Type A criterion (Table 3). The factor identified as Hard-Driving and Competitive (JAS) yielded 100% correct classification provided cortisol was added to these variables. High and low Dysphoria groups were perfectly identified by a model incorporating catecholamines, cardiovascular, and cortisol Recovery measures (Table 4), and Dysphoric Type As showed high Reactivity scores to challenge (Table 5). The results lent support to an association between the Hostile/Irritable components of the Type A construct and cardio-sympatho-adrenal activation including dopamine. Salivary cortisol Reactivity scores were associated with Type A Dysphoria. © 1992.",doi,10.1016/0191-8869(92)90244-J,Scopus,Personality and Individual Differences,"Svebak S., Knardahl S., Nordby H., Aakvaag A.",1992,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Computational Methods And Grammars In Language Evolution: A Survey,"The interest in language evolution by various disciplines, such as linguistics, computer science, biology, etc., makes language evolution models an active research topic and many models have been defined in the last decade. In this work, an overview of computational methods and grammars in language evolution models is given. It aims to introduce readers to the main concepts and the current approaches in language evolution research. Some of the language evolution models, developed during the decade 2003–2012, have been described and classified considering both the grammatical representation (context-free, attribute, Christiansen, fluid construction, or universal grammar) and the computational methods (agent-based, evolutionary computation-based or game theoretic). Finally, an analysis of the surveyed models has been carried out to evaluate their possible extension towards multimodal language evolution. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",doi,10.1007/s10462-015-9449-3,Scopus,Artificial Intelligence Review,"Grifoni P., D’Ulizia A., Ferri F.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Computer Agents Versus Avatars: Responses To Interactive Game Characters Controlled By A Computer Or Other Player,"Computer and videogames often require that users interact with other characters on the screen that represent other real people or characters that are controlled by computer code running within the game. The difference between game play with other avatars (player-controlled characters) or agents (characters controlled by the computer) may influence the engagement a game player experiences. This study investigated the effects of agency (avatar versus agent) and the type of gaming activity (competition versus cooperation) on physiological arousal and subjective evaluation of play. A 2 (avatar, agent)×2 (competition, cooperation) within-subject experiment was conducted (N=32). Players exhibited greater physiological arousal to otherwise identical interactions when other characters were introduced as an avatar rather than an agent. Furthermore, the co-player's source of agency interacted with the type of gaming activity. The results have implications for understanding how different forms of representation in virtual worlds and games will affect psychological responses in the contexts of entertainment, learning and the conduct of serious work. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Overall, when the blood manipulation was on, participants perceived greater gore. Players were significantly more focused when they played in the third-person point of view than when they played in first person. Males were more involved in the game overall regardless of point of view, but females were more focused and involved when they played in third, not first, person. In addition, we wanted to see if game manipulations and perceptions of the game affected aggressive outcomes. Those who played the game in the blood-on condition had more physically aggressive intentions, and when players were more involved and immersed in the game, they reported greater hostility and physically aggressive intentions.

,Cortical Topography Of Event-Related Potentials To Winning And Losing In A Video Tennis Game,"The event-related potentials (ERP) in frontal and posterior associative cortex in right and left hemispheres were studied in two different outcomes of a television tennis game. These outcomes were 'win' and 'loss' of the ball, the first serving as a model of positive, the second as a model of negative emotional reactions. The ERPs consisted of 4 waves: P300, N600, P800, N1000. The most characteristic interhemispheric difference for 'win' was an increase of N600 in the left posterior associative cortex, and for 'loss', a decrease of P800 in the right frontal area. Thus, the positive and negative emotional reactions have specific spatio-temporal cortical organizations. The topography of ERP related to positive and negative emotions was disturbed in depressive patients. The patients revealed a larger negativity of the right posterior associative cortex and the left frontal cortex waves both at winning and losing the ball. © 1986.",doi,10.1016/0167-8760(86)90008-5,Scopus,International Journal of Psychophysiology,"Ivanitsky A.M., Kurnitskaya I.V., Sobotka S.",1986,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,"Cynical Hostility Influences Anger, But Not Cardiovascular Reactivity During Competition With Harassment","Cynical hostility has been linked to coronary heart disease (CHD), and there is mixed support for the hypothesis that cynical hostility may contribute to CHD through exaggerated cardiovascular responses to anger-provoking stressors. The present study tested the influences of cynical hostility on affective and cardiovascular responses to provocation in 68 undergraduate men. Subjects were divided into high and low cynical hostility groups by a median split on Cook-Medley Hostility Scale scores, and half of the subjects in each group were harassed during competition on a video game. High hostile subjects reported greater anger than low hostile subjects during the competition, independently of harassment, and harassment produced stronger feelings of mistreatment, independently of hostility. Harassed subjects experienced larger systolic blood pressure responses only during an affect rating period after the competition, but the responses were not influenced by hostility. These findings provide further evidence that cynical hostility, anger, and cardiovascular reactivity are not simply nor consistently related. © 1995.",doi,10.1016/0167-8760(95)00013-I,Scopus,International Journal of Psychophysiology,Feisten G.,1995,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Damage To Insula Abolishes Cognitive Distortions During Simulated Gambling,"Gambling is a naturalistic example of risky decision-making. During gambling, players typically display an array of cognitive biases that create a distorted expectancy of winning. This study investigated brain regions underpinning gambling-related cognitive distortions, contrasting patients with focal brain lesions to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), insula, or amygdala (""target patients"") against healthy comparison participants and lesion comparison patients (i.e., with lesions that spare the target regions). A slot machine task was used to deliver near-miss outcomes (i.e., nonwins that fall spatially close to a jackpot), and a roulette game was used to examine the gambler's fallacy (color decisions following outcome runs). Comparison groups displayed a heightened motivation to play following near misses (compared with full misses), and manifested a classic gambler's fallacy effect. Both effects were also observed in patients with vmPFC and amygdala damage, but were absent in patients with insula damage. Our findings indicate that the distorted cognitive processing of near-miss outcomes and event sequences may be ordinarily supported by the recruitment of the insula. Interventions to reduce insula reactivity could show promise in the treatment of disordered gambling.",doi,10.1073/pnas.1322295111,Scopus,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,"Clark L., Studer B., Bruss J., Tranel D., Bechara A.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Desensitization To Portrayals Of Real-Life Aggression As A Function Of Television Violence,"Tested in 2 separate experiments, the hypothesis that exposure to violence in the context of TV drama decreases Ss' emotional responsivity to portrayals of real-life aggression. Ss were shown either an excerpt from a violent police drama or a segment of an exciting but nonviolent volley-ball game before watching a videotaped scene of real aggression. Emotionality was measured by changes in skin resistance which was measured continuously throughout the session. In Exp I, Ss were 28 8-10 yr olds, and the real aggression was a film of an argument and fight between 2 preschoolers. In Exp II, 59 college students participated, and reactions to real aggression were measured while Ss watched scenes from news films of the riots at the 1968 Democratic National Convention. With the exception of adult females, Ss who previously had viewed the aggression drama were less aroused by the scenes of real aggression than were Ss who had seen the control film. The hypothesis is further supported by the finding that for most groups of Ss, the amount of TV violence normally viewed was negatively related to responsivity while viewing aggression.

,Design And Development Of A Virtual Reality Simulator For Advanced Cardiac Life Support Training,"The use of virtual reality (VR) training tools for medical education could lead to improvements in the skills of clinicians while providing economic incentives for healthcare institutions. The use of VR tools can also mitigate some of the drawbacks currently associated with providing medical training in a traditional clinical environment such as scheduling conflicts and the need for specialized equipment (e.g., high-fidelity manikins). This paper presents the details of the framework and the development methodology associated with a VR-based training simulator for advanced cardiac life support, a time critical, team-based medical scenario. In addition, we also report the key findings of a usability study conducted to assess the efficacy of various features of this VR simulator through a postuse questionnaire administered to various care providers. The usability questionnaires were completed by two groups that used two different versions of the VR simulator. One version consisted of the VR trainer with it all its features and a minified version with certain immersive features disabled. We found an increase in usability scores from the minified group to the full VR group. © 2013 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/JBHI.2013.2285102,Scopus,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,"Vankipuram A., Khanal P., Ashby A., Vankipuram M., Gupta A., DrummGurnee D., Josey K., Smith M.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Designing Agents That Recognise And Respond To Players' Emotions,"Giving agents the ability to sense, recognise and appropriately respond to the human emotions is one of the main methods to make the agents more believable. In intelligent tutoring systems, learners' affective states have been incorporated in providing adaptive feedback. In game industry, however, emotions of players have not been paid enough attention. Games normally do not take into account of players' emotions when they play games. Non-player characters do not respond to players' emotional status. We argue that adapting to players' emotions can make the non-player characters more believable and the game more enjoyable. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.",doi,10.1007/978-3-642-29934-6_19,Scopus,"Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies",Chen W.,2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Designing Serious Game Interventions For Individuals With Autism,"The design of “Serious games” that use game components (e.g., storyline, long-term goals, rewards) to create engaging learning experiences has increased in recent years. We examine of the core principles of serious game design and examine the current use of these principles in computer-based interventions for individuals with autism. Participants who undergo these computer-based interventions often show little evidence of the ability to generalize such learning to novel, everyday social communicative interactions. This lack of generalized learning may result, in part, from the limited use of fundamental elements of serious game design that are known to maximize learning. We suggest that future computer-based interventions should consider the full range of serious game design principles that promote generalization of learning. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",doi,10.1007/s10803-014-2333-1,Scopus,Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders,"Whyte E.M., Smyth J.M., Scherf K.S.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Determinants Of Adoption Of Mobile Games Under Mobile Broadband Wireless Access Environment,"Rapid advancements in technology and changes in cost have made the game industry a profitable area. Recently, Mobile Broadband Wireless Access technology-based (MBWA) games have been introduced into the marketplace. They are superior to current mobile games in terms of transmission speed and price and to older online games that have limited mobility. Since MBWA technologies, such as High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA), Wireless Broadband (WiBro), and Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) have been developed, customers can enjoy games whenever and wherever they like. We decided to analyze the factors that influence potential users' adoption of MBWA games using an extension of TAM. Most previous game-related studies lack a comprehensive approach to both technological and psychological aspects of game adoption and do not reflect a variety of consumer preferences. We therefore extended TAM to include an emotion variable and measured the moderating effects of gender, age, and prior experience on game adoption. Overall, the results revealed that the effect of perceived enjoyment was very important but that usefulness did not influence an individual's attitude. In addition, we also find that age can be key moderator of game acceptance. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

,Determinants Of Left Ventricular Mass In Normotensive Children,"Left ventricular hypertrophy has been shown to be an independent predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Few studies have examined the determinants of left ventricular mass (LVM) in normotensive children. Eighty-four healthy children, blacks and whites, girls and boys, between 6 and 18 years of age, all with positive family histories of essential hypertension, participated in the study. Demographic and anthropometric characteristics, physical activity, and hemodynamic responses at rest and in response to the stress of forehead cold stimulation and a challenging video game were related to M^mode échocardiographie determined LVM indexed by two indices of body habitus. Hierarchical stepwise multiple regression analysis indicated that the significant independent correlates of LVM per body surface area were gender (boys were greater), baseline systolic blood pressure and heart rate, a physical activity index (sweat episodes per week) and peak systolic blood pressure responses to the forehead cold stressor (final model r2 = 0.49). For LVM/height2 × 7 significant independent corre-lates were adiposity index (weight z score — height z score), gender (boys were greater), age, resting systolic pressure, and systemic vascular resistance reactivity to forehead cold stimulation (final model r2 = 0.42). These findings with normotensive children corroborate other findings that have typically involved hypertensive children, indicating that resting heart rate and systolic pressure, gender, and adiposity are early determinants of LVM indices in children. In addition, the current findings indicate that hemodynamic responses to stress also appear to play a role in the early development of LVM. Results are discussed in terms of future research needs in establishing a standard index for body habitus and the need for longitudinal evaluations of the role of such determinants in the development of essential hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy. © 1993 by the American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd.",doi,10.1093/ajh/6.6.505,Scopus,American Journal of Hypertension,"Trieber F.A., McCaffrey F., Pflieger K., Austin Raunikar R., Strong W.B., Davis H.",1993,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Developing A Relational View Of The Organizing Role Of Objects: A Study Of The Innovation Process In Computer Games,"Innovation processes create distinctive challenges for coordination. Objects are seen as supporting coordination in such settings by enabling the emergent action needed to deal with a dynamic and uncertain process. Thus, previous work has highlighted the role of different types of objects in coordinating the collaborative tasks undertaken by expert groups, either by motivating the creation of new knowledge or through the translation of understanding. Through an empirical study of innovation processes in the computer games sector, our paper adds to this previous work by finding that the relations between objects, and not the objects alone, help to orchestrate multiple collaborative tasks towards a final outcome within temporal and resource constraints. The relational view which emerges from this study shows how such a ‘system of objects’ is able to stabilize coordination of the process while preserving the emergence and autonomy of games developer practices needed to achieve innovation. © The Author(s) 2014.",doi,10.1177/0170840614557213,Scopus,Organization Studies,"Scarbrough H., Panourgias N.S., Nandhakumar J.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Did The Super Bowl Kill The Internet?,"Given the rapid increase in Internet streaming services to access multimedia content, to the detriment of traditional cable, satellite, and terrestrial, it is to be expected that this traffic will affect the performance of the Internet at several levels. One such level is the communication between autonomous systems that is primarily based on border gateway protocol (BGP). In order to understand this impact, a tool was developed to detect the problems that occur during a specific time period. This tool is able to identify and classify flapping events providing information about the networks potentially involved in the disruptions. The main focus of this paper is the analysis of the BGP updates registered during Super Bowl 2016 in order to understand how a large streaming event affects the Internet at the BGP level. Those results show that an increase in the number of updates happened during key times when a large number of concurrent viewers connected to the game. Many dampening and flapping events were observed accordingly. From those events, networks potentially affected were detected and categorized. The results of our study suggest that the Internet is not prepared to accommodate the potential streaming traffic generated during major events. This is of utmost importance for content providers and content delivery networks in designing their broadcast strategies which should take into consideration not only the scalability of their own servers but also the way in which data reaches the viewer. © 2013 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2703980,Scopus,IEEE Access,"Morales N., Bergstrom M.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Discriminating Between Intentional And Unintentional Gaze Fixation Using Multimodal-Based Fuzzy Logic Algorithm For Gaze Tracking System With Nir Camera Sensor,"Gaze tracking systems are widely used in human-computer interfaces, interfaces for the disabled, game interfaces, and for controlling home appliances. Most studies on gaze detection have focused on enhancing its accuracy, whereas few have considered the discrimination of intentional gaze fixation (looking at a target to activate or select it) from unintentional fixation while using gaze detection systems. Previous research methods based on the use of a keyboard or mouse button, eye blinking, and the dwell time of gaze position have various limitations. Therefore, we propose a method for discriminating between intentional and unintentional gaze fixation using a multimodal fuzzy logic algorithm applied to a gaze tracking system with a near-infrared camera sensor. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the conventional method for determining gaze fixation. © 2016 The Authors.",doi,10.1117/1.OE.55.6.063109,Scopus,Optical Engineering,"Naqvi R.A., Park K.R.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,"Disentangling Fun And Enjoyment In Exergames Using An Expanded Design, Play, Experience Framework: A Narrative Review. Games For Health Journal, 2(3), 142–149.","With exergames (as with physical activity in general), more intense and longer-duration game play should accrue more health benefits. Exergames, however, appear to be played for relatively short durations, often at medium or lower intensities. Ostensibly games are played for fun or enjoyment. Enhancing the fun or enjoyment experienced during exergame play should enhance the intensity and duration of physical activity, and thereby the health benefits. Research, reviewed herein, indicates fun and/or enjoyment in games are inherently laden with psychosocial, physiological, and embodiment substrates. Physical activity may also have separate or closely related psychosocial, physiological, and embodiment enjoyment substrates. Research is needed to integrate these levels of experience and to identify the game mechanics that enhance, and even maximize, the fun or enjoyment experienced in exergames, to thereby increase the health benefit.",doi,10.1089/g4h.2013.0022,nagy2015,Games for Health Journal,"Mellecker, R., Lyons, E.

,Distributed Power Control For Multiuser Cognitive Radio Networks With Quality Of Service And Interference Temperature Constraints,"One of the most challenging problems in dynamic resource allocation for cognitive radio networks is to adjust transmission power of secondary users (SUs) while quality of service needs of both SUs and primary users (PUs) are guaranteed. Most power control algorithms only consider interference temperature constraint in single user scenario while ignoring the interference from PUs to SUs and minimum signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) requirement of SUs. In this paper, a distributed power control algorithm without user cooperation is proposed for multiuser underlay CNRs. Specifically, we focus on maximizing total throughput of SUs subject to both maximum allowable transmission power constraint and SINR constraint, as well as interference temperature constraint. To reduce the burden of information exchange and computational complexity, an average interference constraint is proposed. Parameter range and convergence analysis are given for feasible solutions. The resource allocation is transformed into a convex optimization problem, which is solved by using Lagrange dual method. In computer simulations, the effectiveness of our proposed scheme is shown by comparing with distributed constrained power control algorithm and Nash bargaining power control game algorithm.

,Does Computer Game Play Aid In Motivation Of Exercise And Increase Metabolic Activity During Wheelchair Ergometry?,"GAMEWheels is an interface between a portable roller system and a computer that enables a wheelchair user to play commercially available computer video games. The subject controls the game play with the propulsion of their wheelchair's wheels on the rollers. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether using the GAMEWheels System during wheelchair propulsion exercise can help increase the individual's physiological response and aid in the motivation to exercise. Fifteen subjects participated in this study. The subjects propelled their wheelchairs on a portable roller that was equipped with the GAMEWheels System. There were two exercise trials consisting of 2 min of warm-up, 16 min of exercise and 2 min of cool-down. Physiological data (ventilation rate, oxygen consumption, heart rate) were collected. A significant difference (P&lt;0.05) was found between exercise with GAMEWheels versus without GAMEWheels for average ventilation rate and average oxygen consumption. The differences were found during time periods of transition from warm-up to exercise, and before and after the midpoint of exercise. Written questionnaires showed that 87% of the individuals tested reported the system would help them work out on a regular basis. Playing the video game helped these individuals to reach their exercise training zone faster and maintain it for the entire exercise trial.",doi,10.1016/S1350-4533(01)00046-7,Scopus,Medical Engineering and Physics,"O'Connor T.J., Fitzgerald S.G., Cooper R.A., Thorman T.A., Boninger M.L.",2001,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Does Size Matter? An Examination Of Problem Gamblers’ Skin Conductance Responses To Large And Small Magnitude Rewards,"Previous research has shown that individuals with substance use disorder equally value small and large magnitude rewards. This has led some researchers to conceptualize the problematic behaviors associated with this disorder as being, at least in part, caused by a deficiency in processing reward stimuli. Considering the documented similarities between substance use disorder and disordered gambling, the current study sought to investigate whether problem gamblers also display such an aberrant pattern of incentive processing. Skin conductance responses (SCRs) to small and large magnitude wins were recorded from 16 problem gamblers (PGs) and 16 healthy controls (HCs) while they completed a computer-simulated electronic gaming machine task. The results show that, while large wins elicited greater SCRs compared to small wins for the HC group, no difference in SCR amplitude was found following large and small wins in the PG group. These findings suggest that problem gamblers may be less effective at evaluating the value of incentives, and are discussed in terms of relevant theoretical frameworks. © 2017 Society for Psychophysiological Research",doi,10.1111/psyp.12897,Scopus,Psychophysiology,"Lole L., Gonsalvez C.J.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment On Moba Games,"This paper addresses the dynamic difficulty adjustment on MOBA games as a way to improve the players entertainment. Although MOBA is currently one of the most played genres around the world, it is known as a game that offer less autonomy, more challenges and consequently more frustration. Due to these characteristics, the use of a mechanism that performs the difficulty balance dynamically seems to be an interesting alternative to minimize and/or avoid that players experience such frustrations. In this sense, this paper presents a dynamic difficulty adjustment mechanism for MOBA games. The main idea is to create a computer controlled opponent that adapts dynamically to the player performance, trying to offer to the player a better game experience. This is done by evaluating the performance of the player using a metric based on some game features and switching the difficulty of the opponent's artificial intelligence behavior accordingly. Quantitative and qualitative experiments were performed and the results showed that the system is capable of adapting dynamically to the opponent's skills. In spite of that, the qualitative experiments with users showed that the player's expertise has a greater influence on the perception of the difficulty level and dynamic adaptation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",doi,10.1016/j.entcom.2016.10.002,Scopus,Entertainment Computing,"Silva M.P., Silva V.D.N., Chaimowicz L.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Educational Interventions - Computers For Delivering Education To Children With Respiratory Illness And To Their Parents,"Educational interventions for children with asthma can result in both clinical and psychological improvements. However, traditional education programs have been hampered by lack of resources and doubts concerning long-term benefits. Researchers have looked to computer technology to overcome some of these obstacles and respiratory conditions have been the focus for a number of educational computer programs. Computer education packages should have a robust theoretical basis. Many programs aim to improve children's confidence, self-esteem and feelings of control, all of which are linked to compliance and positive health behaviours. The specific skills and knowledge needed for effective self- management also need to be taught in order to equip the child for future independent self- care. Programs tend to be either a stand- alone game, promoting self- regulation and practicing of skills, or an internet- enabled package, which may provide a link to their healthcare provider and/or other people with a similar condition. Computer technology is flexible, can be tailored to individuals' information needs, provides ongoing educational support and promotes active learning. However, there can be problems around accessibility, both in terms of computer ownership and technological literacy. Furthermore, internet sites are largely unregulated and of variable quality. It is essential that educational computer interventions are evidence- based and rigorously evaluated to identify who will benefit most from these packages. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

,Eeg-Based Brain-Computer Interface For Emotional Involvement In Games Through Music,"The reliability of commercial non-invasive BCI (Brain Computer Interface) devices and the lower cost of these EEG-based systems, determined the increasing interest in their application in different research fields, also thanks to the portability of the equipment. The latter feature makes BCI devices particularly suited for entertainment applications especially due to the possibility to detect the mental state of the users. The relationship between emotions and entertainment is obvious, as the influence of music in human emotional states. While BCI devices represent a challenge in gaming motion control, they have been successfully applied in music production (Dan et al., PloS ONE, 2009) and composition (Hamadicharef et al., CW2010 282-286, 2010). In our previous work (Folgieri et al., Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Applied Human Factors and Ergonomics, San Francisco, USA) we focused on conscious production of music notes with the aim of developing a prototype for applications in entertainment. In this work we trace the state-of-the art of our research and present our opinion on possible applications of the preliminary obtained results. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

,Effect Of 'Pc Game Room' Use And Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Exposure On Plasma Testosterone Concentrations In Young Male Koreans,"Background: 'PC Game Rooms' were first popularized in Korea, although the concept is now becoming popular worldwide. PC Game Rooms provide users with high-performance PC connected to the high-speed internet, and access to computer games. However, PC Game Room users are exposed to various hazardous agents such as cigarette smoke in a confined environment, and thus it is likely that excessive PC Game Room use involves abnormal exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) as well as being associated with disturbed sleep or circadian rhythm. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, the exposure to PAH was evaluated by measuring urinary 1-hydroxypyrene (1-OHP) and 2-naphthol. The correlations between PC Game Room use and PAH exposure and plasma testosterone and LH levels were analysed in 208 young male Koreans. Results: Urinary 1-OHP concentrations increased (P = 0.0001) and plasma testosterone levels decreased (P = 0.0153) significantly with increased duration of PC Game Room use. Correlation analysis showed that plasma testosterone concentrations were significantly negatively correlated with urinary 1-OHP (r = -0.22, P = 0.0012) and 2-naphthol (r = -0.15, P = 0.0308) concentrations. Moreover, these associations persisted after adjusting for other independent variables. However, the duration of PC Game Room use itself was not found to be an independent significant determinant of plasma testosterone level. Rather, PC Game Room use increased PAH exposure, which decreased plasma testosterone level. The younger age group (15-19 years) showed a more prominent decrease in plasma testosterone concentrations with increasing duration of PC Game Room use than the older age group (20-24 years) (r2 = 0.355, P = 0.0301 versus r2 = 0.213, P = 0.0001). Conclusions: These results imply that the excessive use of PC Game Rooms is related to an adverse impact on sex hormonal status in young male Koreans via PAH exposure. This effect was more prominent in the younger age group. © The Author 2004. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology.

,Effect Of Contact And No-Contact Small-Sided Games On Elite Handball Players,"This study aimed to investigate the effect of contact (C-SSG) and no-contact (NC-SSG) handball small-sided games (SSGs) on motion patterns and physiological responses of elite handball players. Twelve male handball players performed 10 C-SSG and 10 NC-SSG while being monitored through the heart rate (HR) and rate of perceived exertion (RPE) as physiological responses and time-motion activities profile using video-match analysis. Both game conditions resulted in similar HR responses (P > 0.05), but the NC-SSG led to a higher RPE scores. The time-motion activity analysis featured NC-SSG with a greater amount of walking (855.6 ± 25.1 vs. 690.6 ± 35.2 m) and backward movements (187.5 ± 12.3 vs. 142.5 ± 8.7 m) combined with fast running (232.3 ± 8.5 vs. 159.7 ± 5.7 m) and sprinting (79.5 ± 4.7 vs. 39.7 ± 3.7 m) activities (P < 0.001). Conversely, C-SSG had a higher percentage of jogging and sideway movements associated with greater frequency of jumping (0.87 ± 0.09 vs. 0.31 ± 0.06 nr) and physical contact (1.82 ± 0.55 vs. 0.25 ± 0.03 nr) events (P < 0.001). No between-regimen differences were found for the number of throws (P = 0.745). In addition, the RPE was significantly correlated with fast running relative distances (r = 0.909, P < 0.001) and sprinting relative distances (r = 0.939, P < 0.001). In conclusion, this investigation showed that both C-SSG and NC-SSG in team handball can effectively represent specifically oriented exercises, according to the sport-task and the performance demands. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",doi,10.1080/02640414.2016.1276296,Scopus,Journal of Sports Sciences,"Dello Iacono A., Martone D., Zagatto A.M., Meckel Y., Sindiani M., Milic M., Padulo J.",2018,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Effect Of Meditation On Stress-Induced Changes In Cognitive Functions,"Objectives: The objective of this study was to study the effects of meditation on stress-induced changes in cognitive functions. Methods: The study was conducted on 32 healthy adult male student volunteers who had never practiced meditation before the study. The study consisted of practicing 20 minutes of guided meditation and administration of psychologic stress to the subjects. The psychologic stress was administered to the subjects by asking them to play a (preselected) stressful computer game. The subjects were asked to meditate either before or after the administration of psychologic stress. For the control group measurements, the subjects were asked to wait quietly for an equivalent period of meditation time. Outcome measures: The outcome measures were galvanic skin response (GSR), heart rate (HR), electromyography (EMG), sympathetic reactivity (QTc/QS2 ratio), cortisol, and acute psychologic stress scores. The central nervous system functions were assessed using Wechsler memory scale and visual-choice reaction time (VCRT). These parameters were measured both at the beginning and at the end of the intervention, using a pre-post experimental test design. Results: Computer game stress was associated with a significant increase in physiologic (GSR, EMG, HR, QTc/QS2) and psychologic (acute stress questionnaire scores) markers of stress. Meditation was associated with relaxation (significant decrease in GSR, EMG, QTc/QS2, and acute stress questionnaire scores). Meditation, if practiced before the stressful event, reduced the adverse effects of stress. Memory quotient significantly increased, whereas cortisol level decreased after both stress and meditation. VCRT showed no significant change. Conclusions: Practice of meditation produced a relaxation response even in the young adult subjects who had never practiced meditation before. The practice of meditation reduced the physiologic stress responses without taking away the beneficial effect of stress, namely, improved memory scores. © Copyright 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",doi,10.1089/acm.2010.0142,Scopus,Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine,"Mohan A., Sharma R., Bijlani R.L.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,"Effects Of Adolescent Online Gaming Time And Motives On Depressive, Musculoskeletal, And Psychosomatic Symptoms","Aim. To investigate whether adolescent online gaming time and the additive effect of gaming motives were associated with depressive, musculoskeletal, and psychosomatic symptoms. The hypothesis was that adolescents who engage in online gaming with escape motives and increased online gaming time have higher probability for depressive, musculoskeletal, and psychosomatic symptoms compared to adolescents with other online gaming motives and/or less online gaming time. Method. An anonymous and voluntary questionnaire was completed during class hours by 7,757 Swedish adolescents aged 13-18 years. The questionnaire included demographic background, gaming habits, and depressive, musculoskeletal, and psychosomatic symptoms. Results. It was found that increased online gaming time during weekdays increased the probability of having depressive, musculoskeletal, and psychosomatic symptoms. However, these relations with time spent gaming were further explained by online gaming motives. Weekday online gaming for more than five hours a day, in combination with escape motives, was associated with an increased probability of depressive symptoms (odds ratio (OR) 4.614, 95% CI 3.230-6.590), musculoskeletal symptoms (OR 2.494, 95% CI 1.598-3.892), and psychosomatic symptoms (OR 4.437, 95% CI 2.966-6.637). The probability of ill health decreased when gaming was for fun or had social motives. Conclusion. Excessive gaming time and escape motives were found to be associated with increased probability of ill health among adolescents. Gaming motives may identify gamers in need of support to reduce unhealthy gaming behaviour as well as identify individuals at risk for ill health. © 2015 © Informa Healthcare.",doi,10.3109/03009734.2015.1049724,Scopus,Upsala Journal of Medical Sciences,"Hellström C., Nilsson K.W., Leppert J., Åslund C.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Effects Of Conversational Involvement Cues On Understanding And Emotions In Instant Messaging Conversations,"In today’s multitasking workplace, conversations are often carried out amid other tasks. This article explores how multitasking affects people’s levels of involvement or engagement in their conversations, and how levels of involvement in turn influence people’s language, understanding, and affective responses to the conversation. We manipulated participants’ levels of involvement in instant messaging conversations using a distraction task (an online game). We found that the distraction task lowered communication involvement. In addition, higher levels of involvement (both of the participant and of the partner) had a positive effect on understanding, emotions, and satisfaction. Moreover, a partner’s verbal cues of involvement, such as assent words and definite articles, influenced participants’ communication outcomes. We conclude by suggesting design features that might allow people to maintain appropriate levels of involvement during instant messaging conversations. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.",doi,10.1177/0261927X15571538,Scopus,Journal of Language and Social Psychology,"Nguyen D.T., Fussell S.R.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Effects Of Gene × Attachment Interaction On Adolescents’ Emotion Regulation And Aggressive Hostile Behavior Towards Their Mothers During A Computer Game,"Adolescence is a time of increased emotionality and major changes in emotion regulation often elicited in autonomy-relevant situations. Both genetic as well as social factors may lead to inter-individual differences in emotional processes in adolescence. We investigated whether both 5-HTTLPR and attachment security influence adolescents’ observed emotionality, emotional dysregulation, and their aggressive hostile autonomy while interacting with their mothers. Eighty-eight adolescents at age 12 were observed in interaction with their mothers during a standardized, emotion eliciting computer game task. They were genotyped for the 5-HTTLPR, a repeat polymorphism in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene. Concurrent attachment quality was assessed by the Late Childhood Attachment Interview (LCAI). Results revealed a significant gene × attachment effect showing that ss/sl carriers of 5-HTTLPR show increased emotional dysregulation and aggressive hostile autonomy towards their mothers. The results of the study suggest that secure attachment in adolescence moderates the genetically based higher tendency for emotional dysregulation and aggressive reactions to restrictions of autonomy during emotional social interactions with their mothers. © 2016 Zimmermann and Spangler.",doi,10.3389/fnhum.2016.00254,Scopus,Frontiers in Human Neuroscience,"Zimmermann P., Spangler G.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,"Effects Of Hatha Yoga And African Dance On Perceived Stress, Affect, And Salivary Cortisol. Annals Of Behavioral Medicine : A Publication Of The Society Of Behavioral Medicine, 28(2), 114–8.","BACKGROUND: Dance and yoga have been shown to produce improvements in psychological well-being. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to examine some of the psychological and neuroendocrine response to these activities. METHODS: Sixty-nine healthy college students participated in one of three 90-min classes: African dance (n = 21), Hatha yoga (n= 18), or a biology lecture as a control session (n = 30). Before and after each condition participants completed the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), completed the Positive Affect and Negative Affect Schedule, and provided a saliva sample for cortisol. RESULTS: There were significant reductions in PSS and negative affect (ps < .0001) and Time x Treatment interactions (ps < .0001) such that African dance and Hatha yoga showed significant declines, whereas there was no significant change in biology lecture. There was no significant main effect for positive affect (p = .53), however there was a significant interaction effect (p < .001) such that positive affect increased in African dance, decreased in biology lecture, and did not change significantly in Hatha yoga. There was a significant main effect for salivary cortisol (p < .05) and a significant interaction effect (p < .0001) such that cortisol increased in African dance, decreased in Hatha yoga, and did not change in biology. Changes in cortisol were not significantly related to changes in psychological variables across treatments. There was 1 significant interaction effect (p = .04) such that change in positive affect and change in cortisol were negatively correlated in Hatha yoga but positively correlated in Africa dance and biology. CONCLUSIONS: Both African dance and Hatha yoga reduced perceived stress and negative affect. Cortisol increased in African dance and decreased in Hatha yoga. Therefore, even when these interventions produce similar positive psychological effects, the effects may be very different on physiological stress processes. One factor that may have particular salience is that amount of physiological arousal produced by the intervention.",doi,10.1207/s15324796abm2802_6,nagy2015,Annals of Behavioral Medicine : A Publication of the Society of Behavioral Medicine,"West, J., Otte, C., Geher, K., Johnson, J., Mohr, D.

,Efficacy Of Wii-Fit On Static And Dynamic Balance In Community Dwelling Older Veterans: A Randomized Controlled Pilot Trial,"Background/Objectives. Balance problems are well-established modifiable risk factors for falls, which are common in older adults. The objective of this study was to establish the efficacy of a Wii-Fit interactive video-game-led physical exercise program to improve balance in older Veterans. Methods. A prospective randomized controlled parallel-group trial was conducted at Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Thirty community dwelling Veterans aged 68 (±6.7) years were randomized to either the exercise or control groups. The exercise group performed Wii-Fit program while the control group performed a computer-based cognitive program for 45 minutes, three days per week for 8-weeks. The primary (Berg Balance Scale (BBS)) and secondary outcomes (fear of falling, physical activity enjoyment, and quality of life) were measured at baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks. Results. Of 30 randomized subjects, 27 completed all aspects of the study protocol. There were no study-related adverse events. Intent-to-treat analysis showed a significantly greater improvement in BBS in the exercise group (6.0; 95% CI, 5.1-6.9) compared to the control group (0.5; 95% CI, -0.3-1.3) at 8 weeks (average intergroup difference (95% CI), 5.5 (4.3-6.7), p < 0.001) after adjusting for baseline.

,Egocentric Fairness Perception: Emotional Reactions And Individual Differences In Overt Responses,"Extensive research documents the existence of egocentric biases in the perception and application of justice norms. The origin of these biases remains poorly understood. We investigated both inter- and intra-individual differences in egocentric justice biases. Participants played an ultimatum game presumably with different anonymous players (simulated by a computer) in which they contributed differentially to the joint production of the initial endowment. We examined how contributions (low vs. high) affect proposers' offers and responders' acceptance decisions, as well as their fairness judgments and their emotional reactions to different types of offers (equal, equitable, unfair, and hyperfair). An egocentric bias in proposers' offers (indicating more flexible preferences) was found only in individualists and not in prosocials, suggesting differences in the motivations (or cognitions) underlying their choice of justice norms. Responders also showed egocentric biases in their judgments of fairness and in their emotional reactions to equal and equitable offers, but not in their acceptance decisions. Such dissociation might suggest that some form of emotion regulation occurred. Responders may evaluate offers on valence dimensions (e.g., goal conduciveness/outcome favorability and norm compatibility/justice) that are multiply interacting and potentially conflicting. The individual's acceptance/rejection decision reflects the relative weight attributed to competing appraisals. For this overt behavioral decision, the (personal) appraisal of outcome favorability that drives (analytical) acceptance of goal-conducive outcome seems to be stronger than the (social) appraisal of outcome fairness, which may trigger covert (emotional) rejection of offers that are incompatible with justice norms. Our data show that the emotional reaction patterns provide a more fine-grained readout of the overall evaluation of the proposer's action, the underlying emotional dynamics of which may, in real life, strongly determine future interactions with specific partners. Further research on the relationship between emotion and behavior in economic games is needed to explore potential dissociations and long-term effects. © 2014 Bediou, Scherer.",doi,10.1371/journal.pone.0088432,Scopus,PLoS ONE,"Bediou B., Scherer K.R.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Electroencephalographic Assessment Of Player Experience: A Pilot Study In Affective Ludology,"Psychophysiological methods, such as electroencephalography (EEG), provide reliable high-resolution measurements of affective player experience. In this article, the authors present a psychophysiological pilot study and its initial results to solidify a research approach they call affective ludology, a research area concerned with the physiological measurement of affective responses to player-game interaction. The study investigates the impact of level design on brainwave activity measured with EEG and on player experience measured with questionnaires. The goal of the study was to investigate cognition, emotion, and player behavior from a psychological perspective. For this purpose, a methodology for assessing gameplay experience with subjective and objective measures was developed extending prior work in physiological measurements of affect in digital gameplay. The authors report the result of this pilot study, the impact of three different level design conditions (boredom, immersion, and flow) on EEG, and subjective indicators of gameplay experience. Results from the subjective gameplay experience questionnaire support the validity of our level design hypotheses. Patterns of EEG spectral power show that the immersion-level design elicits more activity in the theta band, which may support a relationship between virtual spatial navigation or exploration and theta activity. The research shows that facets of gameplay experience can be assessed with affective ludology measures, such as EEG, in which cognitive and affective patterns emerge from different level designs. © 2011 SAGE Publications.",doi,10.1177/1046878110378140,Scopus,Simulation and Gaming,"Nacke L.E., Stellmach S., Lindley C.A.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Emergence Of Trend Trading And Its Effects In Minority Game,"In this paper, we extended Minority Game (MG) by equipping agents with both value and trend strategies. In the new model, agents (we call them strong-adaptation agents) can autonomically select to act as trend trader or value trader when they game and learn in system. So the new model not only can reproduce stylized factors but also has the potential to investigate into the process of some problems of securities market. We investigated the dynamics of trend trading and its impacts on securities market based on the new model. Our research found that trend trading is inevitable when strong-adaptation agents make decisions by inductive reasoning. Trend trading (of strong-adaptation agents) is not irrational behavior but shows agent's strong-adaptation intelligence, because strong-adaptation agents can take advantage of the pure value agents when they game together in hybrid system. We also found that strong-adaptation agents do better in real environment. The results of our research are different with those of behavior finance researches. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

,Emotion Regulation And Mania Risk: Differential Responses To Implicit And Explicit Cues To Regulate,"Background and objectives People prone to mania use emotion regulation (ER) strategies well when explicitly coached to do so in laboratory settings, but they find these strategies ineffective in daily life. We hypothesized that, compared with control participants, mania-prone people would show ER deficits when they received implicit, but not explicit, cues to use ER. Methods Undergraduates (N = 66) completed the Hypomanic Personality Scale (HPS) and were randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions: automatic ER (scrambled sentence primes), deliberate ER (verbal instructions), or control (no priming or instructions to use ER). Then, participants played a videogame designed to evoke anger. Emotion responses were measured with a multi-modal assessment of self-reported affect, psychophysiology, and facial expressions. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) was used to index ER. Results The videogame effectively elicited subjective anger, angry facial expressions, and heart rate increases when keys malfunctioned. As hypothesized, persons who were more mania prone showed greater RSA increases in the deliberate ER condition than in the automatic or control conditions. Limitations One potential limitation is the use of an analog sample. Conclusions Findings suggest that those at risk for mania require more explicit instruction to engage ER effectively. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

,Emotional Expressivity As A Signal Of Cooperation,"Previous research has suggested that the spontaneous display of positive emotion may be a reliable signal of cooperative tendency in humans. Consistent with this proposition, several studies have found that self-reported cooperators indeed display higher levels of positive emotions than non-cooperators. In this study, we defined cooperators and non-cooperators in terms of their behavior as the proposer in an ultimatum game, and video-taped their facial expressions as they faced unfair offers as a responder. A detailed analysis of the facial expressions displayed by participants revealed that cooperators displayed greater amounts of emotional expressions, not limited to positive emotional expression, when responding to unfair offers in the ultimatum game. These results suggest that cooperators may be more emotionally expressive than non-cooperators. We speculate that emotional expressivity can be a more reliable signal of cooperativeness than the display of positive emotion alone. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

,Emotional Responses To Victory And Defeat As A Function Of Opponent,"The experiment with 33 participants showed that the social relationship between players (playing a first-person shooter game against a friend or a stranger, and in single-player mode) influences phasic emotion-related psychophysiological responses to digital game events representing victory and defeat. Irrespective of opponent type, a defeat elicited increasing positive affect and decreasing negative affect (supporting earlier results), but it was most arousing when the opponent was a friend. Surprisingly, victory - in addition to positive emotion when playing against either human opponent - also elicited a negative response when the opponent was a friend. Responses to defeat in a single-player game were similar, but to a victory almost neutral. These results show that the social context affects not only the general experience, but also individual emotional responses, which has implications for adaptive game systems, experience research, and game design alike. © 2010-2012 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/T-AFFC.2013.12,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing,"Kivikangas J.M., Ravaja N.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas

,Endothelin-1 Gene Lys198asn Polymorphism And Blood Pressure Reactivity,"The Lys198Asn polymorphism of the endothelin-1 gene has been associated with increased blood pressure levels in several studies involving European and Australian adults. The purpose of the present study was to examine the potential moderating influence of ethnicity, obesity, and socioeconomic status on associations between the ET-1/Lys 198Asn polymorphism and hemodynamic function at rest and during two laboratory stressors (video game, forehead cold) in a sample of 161 black and 213 white American normotensive young adults (mean age, 18.5 ± 2.7 years). Carrier status of the T allele was not associated with resting blood pressure or total peripheral resistance index. However, carriers of the T allele showed greater diastolic blood pressure increases to the video game (P<0.04), particularly among those who were obese (P<0.02). Carrier status also interacted with socioeconomic status such that T allele carriers who came from lower socioeconomic status backgrounds exhibited the greatest increases in systolic blood pressure to the video game challenge (P<0.05). In conclusion, the findings point out the importance of examining the impact of genetic polymorphisms on blood pressure control phenotypes within the context of potentiating environmental factors.",doi,10.1161/01.HYP.0000091266.41333.15,Scopus,Hypertension,"Treiber F.A., Barbeau P., Harshfield G., Kang H.-S., Pollock D.M., Pollock J.S., Snieder H.",2003,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Energy Expended Playing Xbox Kinect™ And Wii™ Games: A Preliminary Study Comparing Single And Multiplayer Modes,"Objectives: It has been reported that a higher galvanic skin response is seen when playing video games against another human player than when playing alone, which suggests increased effort. The objectives of this study were to compare energy expenditure when playing two popular active video game consoles, and to compare energy expenditure when playing in single and multiplayer modes. Design: Crossover trial with randomised playing order. Participants: Fourteen healthy adults with a mean age of 21 [standard deviation (SD) 3] years. Methods and interventions: Energy expenditure was measured using an indirect calorimeter at rest, during 10. minutes of play on Xbox Kinect™ Reflex Ridge in both single and multiplayer modes, and during 10. minutes of play on Wii™ Sports Boxing in both single and multiplayer modes. Main outcome measures: Metabolic equivalents (METs), heart rate, oxygen consumption and kilocalories expended. Results: The energy expenditure during all gaming conditions was of a light intensity. Playing on the Xbox Kinect elicited greater energy expenditure than playing on the Wii [mean difference. =0.9 METs, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.2 to 1.5]. Playing games in multiplayer mode led to greater energy expenditure (mean difference. =0.5 METs, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.9) and heart rate (mean difference. =7.9 beats/minute, 95% CI 2.0 to 13.8) than playing in single player mode. Conclusions: No gaming condition required moderate-intensity activity in this group of young healthy adults. Potential explanations for the difference in energy expenditure seen between consoles and modes are discussed. © 2012 Chartered Society of Physiotherapy.",doi,10.1016/j.physio.2012.05.010,Scopus,Physiotherapy (United Kingdom),"O'Donovan C., Hirsch E., Holohan E., McBride I., McManus R., Hussey J.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Energy Expenditure And Cardiovascular Responses To Seated And Active Gaming In Children,"Objective: To examine energy expenditure and cardiovascular responses in children during seated and active gaming. Design: Comparison study. Setting: Children's Exercise Laboratory, University of Hong Kong. Participants: Eighteen children (aged 6-12 years) recruited from local primary schools. Main Exposure: Active and seated computer games played by all participants. Main Outcome Measures: Resting energy expenditure and heart rate measured before gaming, during seated gaming, and during use of 2 active gaming formats (XaviX bowling and XaviX J-Mat; SSD Company Ltd, Shiga, Japan). We used repeated-measures analyses of variance to compare the outcome measures. Results: The energy expenditure was significantly higher during seated gaming (mean [SD], 1.31 [0.19] kcal/ min-1; P&lt;.001), XaviX bowling (1.89 [0.45] kcal/min-1; P&lt;.001), and XaviX J-Mat gaming (5.23 [1.63] kcal/ min-1; P&lt;.001) compared with rest. The energy expended above rest was significantly higher for the 2 active gaming formats (P&lt;.001 for both) compared with seated gaming. The heart rate was significantly higher during XaviX bowling (mean [SD, ]102 [20] beats/min-1; P&lt;.001) and XaviX J-Mat gaming (160 [20] beats/ min-1; P&lt;.001) compared with rest. Heart rate during the XaviX J-Mat gaming was significantly higher than during seated gaming (P&lt;.001). Conclusions: This study has shown that using active gaming media results in meaningful increases in energy expenditure and heart rate compared with the seated screen environment. Manipulating the gaming environment can provide children with appealing activity alternatives, and further development of ""exertainment"" interventions is warranted, in particular determination of sustainability. ©2008 American Medical Association.

,Enhancing Intelligence In Multimodal Emotion Assessments,"Computer systems are a part of everyday life, since they influence human behavior and stimulate changes in the emotional states of the users. The assessment of users’ emotions during their interaction with computer systems can help to provide tailorable website interfaces and better recommendations systems. However, emotions are complex and difficult to identify or assess. Previous studies have shown that, in a real-world scenario, the use of single sensors do not provide an accurate emotional assessment. Hence, in this study, we propose a framework that takes into account multiple sensors so that conclusions can be drawn about the emotional state of the user at the time of interaction. The proposed multi-sensing approach includes several inputs from users (such as speech, facial movements, and everyday activities), and uses an artificial intelligent strategy to map these different responses into one or more emotional states. The Componential Emotion Theory and Scherer’s Emotional Semantic Space are used to underpin the theoretical framework. The experimental results show that the combination of outputs generated by multiple sensors provides a more accurate assessment of emotional states than when the sensors are treated individually. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",doi,10.1007/s10489-016-0842-7,Scopus,Applied Intelligence,"Gonçalves V.P., Costa E.P., Valejo A., Filho G.P.R., Johnson T.M., Pessin G., Ueyama J.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Enhancing The Therapy Experience Using Principles Of Video Game Design,"Purpose: This article considers the potential benefits that applying design principles from contemporary video games may have on enhancing therapy experiences. Method: Six principles of video game design are presented, and their relevance for enriching clinical experiences is discussed. Results: The motivational and learning benefits of each design principle have been discussed in the education literature as having positive impacts on student motivation and learning and are related here to aspects of clinical practice. The essential experience principle suggests connecting all aspects of the experience around a central emotion or cognitive connection. The discovery principle promotes indirect learning in focused environments. The risktaking principle addresses the uncertainties clients face when attempting newly learned skills in novel situations. The generalization principle encourages multiple opportunities for skill transfer. The reward system principle directly relates to the scaffolding of frequent and varied feedback in treatment. Last, the identity principle can assist clients in using their newly learned communication skills to redefine self-perceptions. Conclusion: These principles highlight areas for research and interventions that may be used to reinforce or advance current practice. © 2016 American Speech-Language-Hearing Association.",doi,10.1044/2015_AJSLP-14-0059,Scopus,American Journal of Speech-Language Pathology,"Folkins J.W., Brackenbury T., Krause M., Haviland A.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,"Estradiol, Progesterone, And Cardiovascular Response To Stress","The present study examined the relationship between endogenous estradiol and progesterone levels and cardiovascular activity at rest and during stress in healthy young women. Subjects were tested in both the follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle. Results indicated that, during the luteal phase, higher levels of estradiol were associated with lower levels of cardiac output responses to the combined video game and speech tasks, and lower levels of heart rate and systolic blood pressure responses to the cold pressor; estradiol levels were also associated positively wit PEP responses to the cold pressor but only under high levels of progesterone. Additionally, during the luteal phase, higher levels of progesterone were associated with higher TPR and lower stroke volume responses to the cold pressor. In contrast, during the follicular phase, higher levels of progesterone were associated with lower vascular resistance responses to the cold pressor. Consistent with data from studies using exogenous estrogens, these results suggest that estradiol may contribute to a lowering of cardiovascular responses to stress.",doi,10.1016/0306-4530(95)00053-4,Scopus,Psychoneuroendocrinology,"Sita A., Miller S.B.",1996,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Evaluating The Efficacy Of Simulators And Multimedia For Refreshing Acls Skills In India,"Objective: Data on the efficacy of the simulation and multimedia teaching modalities is limited, particularly in developing nations. This study evaluates the effectiveness of simulator and multimedia educational tools in India. Methods: Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) certified paramedic students in India were randomized to either Simulation, Multimedia, or Reading for a 3-h ACLS refresher course. Simulation students received a lecture and 10 simulator cases. The Multimedia group viewed the American Heart Association (AHA) ACLS video and played a computer game. The Reading group independently read with an instructor present. Students were tested prior to (pre-test), immediately after (post-test), and 3 weeks after (short-term retention test), their intervention. During each testing stage subjects completed a cognitive, multiple-choice test and two cardiac arrest scenarios. Changes in exam performance were analyzed for significance. A survey was conducted asking students' perceptions of their assigned modality. Results: One hundred and seventeen students were randomized to Simulation (n = 39), Multimedia (n = 38), and Reading (n = 40). Simulation demonstrated greater improvement managing cardiac arrest scenarios compared to both Multimedia and Reading on the post-test (9% versus 5% and 2%, respectively, p < 0.05) and Reading on the short-term retention test (6% versus -1%, p < 0.05). Multimedia showed significant improvement on cognitive, short-term retention testing compared to Simulation and Reading (5% versus 0% and 0%, respectively, p < 0.05). On the survey, 95% of Simulation and 84% of Multimedia indicated they enjoyed their modality. Conclusion: Simulation and multimedia educational tools were effective and may provide significant additive benefit compared to reading alone. Indian students enjoyed learning via these modalities. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

,Evaluating The Impact Of A Cloud-Based Serious Game On Obese People,"This paper describes the process of monitoring obese people through a cloud-based serious game that promotes them to engage in physical exercises in a playful manner. The monitoring process focuses on obtaining various health and exercise-related parameters of obese during game-play, such as heart rate, weight, step count and calorie burn, which contributes to their weight loss. While the obese are engaged in the game session, therapists/caregivers can access their health data anytime, anywhere and from any device to change the game complexity level and accordingly provide on the spot recommendation. In our study, we evaluate how the different physical activities performed through this game impact their cognitive behavior in terms of attention, relevance, confidence and satisfaction. The evaluation was based on the participation of 150 undergraduate obese and overweight students who were asked to play the game and fill a questionnaire after game-play. The data analysis conducted on their feedback showed that they were self-aware and motivated to play the game for weight loss. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

,Evaluating The Nintendo Wii For Assessing Return To Activity Readiness In Youth With Mild Traumatic Brain Injury,"Adolescents with mild traumatic brain injuries (MTBI) are at substantial risk for repeat injury if they return to activity too soon. Post-concussion symptoms and impaired balance are two factors that limit return to activity. Post-injury assessments that challenge activity tolerance and balance skills are needed to ensure readiness to return to activity. This cross-sectional study evaluated the Nintendo Wii as a measure of exertion (heart rate HR, respiration rate RR, and caloric expenditure) and balance testing for youth with MTBI in a clinical setting. Twenty-four youth with MTBI, ages 9-18, played six Wii games. The Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency 2nd edition (BOT-2) and the Community Balance and Mobility Scale (CBM) were used as balance indicators. The Wii Fit Running game demonstrated the highest caloric expenditure and HR (p = .010). Frequency counts of balance loss during Wii game play did not correlate with performance on the BOT-2 or the CBM. Type, number, and time since injury were predictive of balance performance on the CBM (p = .008). Findings provide preliminary evidence for the use of the Wii as an exertion challenge to evaluate tolerance for exercise post-concussion. Frequency count of balance loss during Wii game play, however, was not a valid measure of balance impairment post-MTBI. © 2014 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.",doi,10.3109/01942638.2014.885103,Scopus,Physical and Occupational Therapy in Pediatrics,"Dematteo C., Greenspoon D., Levac D., Harper J.A., Rubinoff M.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Evaluation Of A 3D Serious Game For Advanced Life Support Retraining,"Objective: Advanced life support (ALS) knowledge and skills decrease in as little as three months, but only a few ALS providers actually attend retraining courses. We assess the effectiveness of a 3D serious game as a new tool for frequent ALS retraining. Methods: We developed a 3D serious game for scenario-based ALS retraining. The serious game, called EMSAVE, was designed to promote self-correction while playing. We organized a retraining course in which 40 ALS providers played two cardiac arrest scenarios with EMSAVE and took a test with 38 multiple-choice questions before and after playing. We administered the same test again 3 months later to evaluate retention. Participants also rated EMSAVE and the overall retraining experience. Results: After using EMSAVE, the number of correct answers per participant increased by 4.8 (95%CI +3.4, +6.2, p<. 0.001) and all but one participant improved. After 3 months, despite an expected decrease in ALS knowledge and skills (-1.9 correct answers, 95%CI -0.6, -3.3, p<. 0.01), there was a significant retention benefit (+2.9 correct answers per participant, 95%CI +1.5, +4.2, p<. 0.001). Moreover, all but one participant regarded EMSAVE as a valuable tool to refresh ALS knowledge and skills, and 85% of participants were also willing to devote 1. h/month to retrain with the serious game. Conclusions: A 3D serious game for scenario-based retraining proved effective to retrain in ALS and supported retention of acquired knowledge and skills at 3 months. EMSAVE also positively engaged and motivated participants. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2013.05.007,Scopus,International Journal of Medical Informatics,"Buttussi F., Pellis T., Cabas Vidani A., Pausler D., Carchietti E., Chittaro L.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Evaluation Of Learning Outcomes Using An Educational Iphone Game Vs. Traditional Game,"In this paper, we present an initial study to determine the subject preferences for educational computer games for children, in which 150 education professionals participated. From the results of this first study, we have developed an iPhone game for transmitting knowledge as part of multiculturalism, solidarity and tolerance following established learning theories, several design principles, and the objectives and competences of the Spanish law for primary education. We also report on a second study to determine whether the iPhone game has better learning outcomes than a traditional game by analyzing the participation of 84 children ranging in age from 8 to 10 years old. The frequency of playing with consoles or computer games was also taken into account in this second study, and the worldwide trend of previous studies has been corroborated. For learning outcomes, the results did not show significant differences between the two groups. However, 96% of the children indicated that they would like to play with the iPhone game again, and 90% indicated that they preferred the experience with the iPhone game over the traditional one. From these results, we can conclude that the children achieved similar knowledge improvements using both the autonomous game (iPhone game) and the custom, guided game (traditional game). This could facilitate versatility in the learning process since the learning activity could be performed at any place and time without requiring supervision. Therefore, it could be a useful tool in the learning process and help teachers to fulfill students' training needs. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

,Evolution Is Not Enough: Revolutionizing Current Learning Environments To Smart Learning Environments,"Advances in technology in recent years have changed the learning behaviors of learners and reshaped teaching methods. This had resulted in several challenges faced by current educational systems, such as an increased focus on informal learning, a growing gap of prior knowledge among students in classrooms and a mismatch between individual career choices and the development of the work force. This paper looks at these challenges with a view towards revolutionizing current learning environments to smart learning environments and provides new suggestions for technological solutions. Furthermore, this paper argues for a transformation from the current learning environments to smart learning environments. This is to be achieved by reengineering the fundamental structure and operations of current educational systems to better integrate these new technologies with the required pedagogical shift. The future perspectives of smart learning environments are reviewed and shared, through examples of emerging innovations such as the flipped classroom, game based learning, gesture based learning, along with pedagogical shifts, such as life-long learning portfolio maintenance, team teaching, and separation of learning and competency assessment. © 2016 International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society.",doi,10.1007/s40593-016-0108-x,Scopus,International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education,"Kinshuk, Chen N.-S., Cheng I.-L., Chew S.W.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas

,"Examining Desensitization Using Facial Electromyography:violent Videogames, Gender, And Affective Responding","The results of research investigating the effects of violent videogames have been inconsistent. Some evidence suggests that exposure to violent videogames decreases physiological arousal and results in desensitization to subsequent exposure to violent stimuli. Other research does not support these findings. This study examined physiological and affective desensitization to violent videogame play. Participants played a violent or non-violent videogame and then viewed aggressive, pleasant, and neutral images. Participants' negative affect in response to the images was assessed by examining activity in the brow muscle region (i.e., corrugator supercilii), heart rate (HR), self-reported affect, and self-reported arousal. Based on previous research regarding the General Aggression Model (GAM), we expected that participants who played the violent videogame would demonstrate desensitization as evidenced by less reactivity in the corrugator supercilii region and less HR reactivity in response to violent images than participants who played the nonviolent videogame. We also expected that participants who played the violent videogame would rate the aggressive images as less aversive than those who played the nonviolent game. Contrary to our expectations, the findings were not consistent with the hypotheses based on the GAM. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

,Exercising Your Brain: A Review Of Human Brain Plasticity And Training-Induced Learning,"Human beings have an amazing capacity to learn new skills and adapt to new environments. However, several obstacles remain to be overcome in designing paradigms to broadly improve quality of life. Arguably, the most notable impediment to this goal is that learning tends to be quite specific to the trained regimen and does not transfer to even qualitatively similar tasks. This severely limits the potential benefits of learning to daily life. This review discusses training regimens that lead to the acquisition of new knowledge and strategies that can be used flexibly across a range of tasks and contexts. Possible characteristics of training regimens are proposed that may be responsible for augmented learning, including the manner in which task difficulty is progressed, the motivational state of the learner, and the type of feedback the training provides. When maximally implemented in rehabilitative paradigms, these characteristics may greatly increase the efficacy of training. © 2008 American Psychological Association.",doi,10.1037/a0014345,Scopus,Psychology and Aging,"Green C.S., Bavelier D.",2008,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Explicit And Implicit Emotional Expression In Bulimia Nervosa In The Acute State And After Recovery,"Expression of emotional state is considered to be a core facet of an individual's emotional competence. Emotional processing in BN has not been often studied and has not been considered from a broad perspective. This study aimed at examining the implicit and explicit emotional expression in BN patients, in the acute state and after recovery. Sixty-three female participants were included: 22 BN, 22 recovered BN (R-BN), and 19 healthy controls (HC). The clinical cases were drawn from consecutive admissions and diagnosed according to DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria. Self reported (explicit) emotional expression was measured with State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory-2, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and Symptom Check List-90 items-Revised. Emotional facial expression (implicit) was recorded by means of an integrated camera (by detecting Facial Feature Tracking), during a 20 minutes therapeutic video game. In the acute illness explicit emotional expression [anxiety (p<0.001) and anger (p<0.05)] was increased. In the recovered group this was decreased to an intermediate level between the acute illness and healthy controls [anxiety (p<0.001) and anger (p<0.05)]. In the implicit measurement of emotional expression patients with acute BN expressed more joy (p<0.001) and less anger (p<0.001) than both healthy controls and those in the recovered group. These findings suggest that there are differences in the implicit and explicit emotional processing in BN, which is significantly reduced after recovery, suggesting an improvement in emotional regulation. © 2014 Tárrega et al.",doi,10.1371/journal.pone.0101639,Scopus,PLoS ONE,"Tárrega S., Fagundo A.B., Jiménez-Murcia S., Granero R., Giner-Bartolomé C., Forcano L., Sánchez I., Santamaría J.J., Ben-Moussa M., Magnenat-Thalmann N., Konstantas D., Lucas M., Nielsen J., Bults R.G.A., Lam T., Kostoulas T., Fakotakis N., Riesco N., Wolz I., Comín-Colet J., Cardi V., Treasure J., Fernández-Formoso J.A., Menchón J.M., Fernández-Aranda F.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Exposure In Vivo Of Obsessive-Compulsives Under Distracting And Attention-Focusing Conditions: Replication And Extension,"Exposure to feared situations has been found to result in decrement in subjective anxiety and heart rate (HR) for anxiety-disordered patients. In a preliminary study using a crossover design, obsessive-compulsives experienced less return of fear during in vivo exposure when attention was focused on their feared obsessional stimuli than when it was distracted from them. Thus, attention seemed to facilitate between-session but not within-session habituation. The present study was conducted to replicate and extend the previous investigation using a between-groups design. Seventeen obsessive-compulsives with washing rituals were exposed to their most feared contaminant for two consecutive 90-min sessions under either distracting (playing a video game) or attention-focusing (observing and discussing the contaminant) conditions. Consistent with our earlier findings, HR response reduced substantially during attention-focusing but remained elevated during distraction. However, on subjective anxiety greater reduction was observed in the distraction condition, particularly during the first exposure session. Results are discussed in light of findings by other investigators regarding procedural manipulations during exposure. © 1986.",doi,10.1016/0005-7967(86)90013-6,Scopus,Behaviour Research and Therapy,"Grayson J.B., Foa E.B., Stekette G.S.",1986,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Exposure To Violent Video Games Increases Implicit Aggressiveness.,"The effects of exposure to violent video games on automatic associations with the self were investigated in a sample of 121 students. Playing the violent video game Doom led participants to associate themselves with aggressive traits and actions on the Implicit Association Test. In addition, self-reported prior exposure to violent video games predicted automatic aggressive self-concept, above and beyond self-reported aggression. Results suggest that playing violent video games can lead to the automatic learning of aggressive self-views.",doi,10.1016/j.adolescence.2003.10.004,anderson2010,Journal of Adolescence,"Uhlmann, E., Swanson, J.",2004,NA,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Expressive Modulation Of Neutral Visual Speech,"Expressive speech animation, or expressive visual speech, is the process by which some representation of facial features (graphical, statistical, or otherwise) is smoothly changed over time to articulate verbal speech, convey emotion through facial expression, or express other characteristics such as visual prosody. Used extensively in the production of movies and computer games, current techniques for visual speech animation are slow, laborious, and expensive. Therefore, efforts to automate the complex processes involved are of great interest to these multibillion-dollar industries. In this article, the authors describe a method for transforming speech animation between different emotional expressions. When the same sentence is spoken in two different expressive styles, a large proportion of the two sentences is the same. Intuitively, then, after factoring out timing differences, the residual is the expression. Based on earlier work showing two general categories of facial movements in expressive speech-high-frequency speech components (the content) and low-frequency expressive components (the style)-the authors use independent component analysis (ICA) to factorize these movements and show how the energy for different speaking styles is distributed in this space. They transform speaking style by projecting novel animation curves into the low-dimensional ICA space, redistributing the energy in the independent components, and reconstructing the animation by inverting the projection. As they describe, a single ICA model can be used for factoring multiple expressive styles, and their method works on a variety of data types. Evaluations show that viewers can identify the expressive style generated and have difficulty distinguishing transformed animation from ground truth. Finally, they show how their technique can be used to represent complex blends of expression. © 2016 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/MMUL.2016.63,Scopus,IEEE Multimedia,"Shaw F., Theobald B.-J.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Extreme Expression Of Sweating In 3D Virtual Human,"Displaying extreme expressions such as scared until sweating is not easy task that can be accomplished in 3D games and facial animation simulation in real-time. Several difficulties faced by researches such as the complexity of simulation including physical properties of the muscles, emotions, properties of fluids and texture element. The next part is how to control the facial animation with one of the two sweating generators simultaneously. This research present techniques for generating extreme expression in 3D facial animation. The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is employed to describe and generate facial expressions. It breaks down facial actions into minor units known as Action Units (AUs). Facial expressions are generated by combining specific independent Action Units. The generated expressions cover sadness, anger, happy and fear. The first type of sweat is dropping sweat using particle system. The other type of sweat is texture based, when the sweat is stimulated the texture drop will flowing down around surface of the forehead area. The technique presented in this paper is believed able to give more realism to virtual human by providing features of extreme expression. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

,Factors Underlying Male And Female Use Of Violent Video Games,"Research has consistently shown that males play violent video games more frequently than females, but factors underlying this gender gap have not been examined to date. This approach examines the assumption that males play violent video games more because they anticipate more enjoyment and less guilt from engaging in virtual violence than females. This may be because males are less empathetic, tend to morally justify physical violence more and have a greater need for sensation and aggression in video game play than females. Results of a path model based on survey data of 444 respondents and using multi-step multiple mediation analyses confirm these assumptions. Taken together, the findings of this study shed further light on the gender gap in violent video game use. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014.",doi,10.1177/1461444814533067,Scopus,New Media and Society,"Hartmann T., Möller I., Krause C.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,"Fear And The Musical Avant-Garde In Games: Interviews With Jason Graves, Garry Schyman, Paul Gorman And Michael Kamper","If you have ever experienced the cold chill of fear when watching a film or playing a video or computer game, it is highly probable that your responses have been manipulated by composers exploiting the musical resources of modernism, experimental music and the avant-garde. Depictions of fear, horror, amorality, evil and so on, have come to be associated with these sound worlds, particularly within the realm of popular culture. A number of game titles and franchises have emerged in recent years, which exploit these musical associations, exploring their creative potential as vehicles of fear and horror within the context of interactive game-play. Two composers associated with this approach are Jason Graves (Dead Space franchise) and Garry Schyman (Bioshock franchise, Dante’s Inferno). This article explores perceived links between avant-garde music (as defined in ‘populist’ rather than musicological or historical terms, as a ‘catch-all’ phrase for twentieth-century music exploiting experimental techniques, modernism and atonality) and depictions of horror and fear through interviews with Graves and Schyman. Further questions are posed to Paul Gorman (audio director – Dante’s Inferno) and Michael Kamper (audio director – Bioshock 2) to contextualize the discussion by demonstrating the significant creative influence of audio directors in guiding the musical approach taken by game composers. The article would be of potential interest to anyone with an interest in game audio, commercial composition/composers, game development, creative collaboration, audio direction and the power of music to manipulate the emotions in association with visual media. © 2014 Intellect Ltd Article.",doi,10.1386/host.5.1.127_1,Scopus,Horror Studies,Mitchell H.R.,2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Fear Of Negative Evaluation Moderates Effects Of Social Exclusion On Selective Attention To Social Signs,"Previous studies demonstrated that fear of negative evaluation (FNE) moderates responses to exclusion in late-stage social outcomes (e.g., social judgements and behaviours). People with low levels of FNE show affiliative responses, feeling compelled to recover their sense of belonging, whereas people with high levels of FNE do not. This study examined whether FNE also moderates responses to exclusion in early-stage interpersonal perception, manifested in selective attention. The experiment using a dot-probe task revealed that exclusion led participants with low levels of FNE to increase attention to signs of social acceptance (i.e., smiling faces). It also revealed that exclusion led those with high levels of FNE to pay more attention to signs of social threat (i.e., angry faces) relative to those of social acceptance. Thus, exclusion makes the motivation to protect oneself from social threats dominant over the motivation to reestablish social bonds among those who fear negative evaluation. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",doi,10.1080/02699931.2014.977848,Scopus,Cognition and Emotion,"Tanaka H., Ikegami T.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Feasibility Of Activity-Promoting Video Games Among Obese Adolescents And Young Adults In A Clinical Setting,"One component of the recent obesity epidemic is the sedentary behaviour of children and adolescents e.g., use of video games consoles. The new generation of video games requires body movements and might thus increase activity. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether such games could have an effect on physical activity in obese adolescents in a clinical setting. Between March and May 2007 activity-promoting video games ("" apvg"" ) were offered to all 84 inpatients (aged 13-28 years) registered in a long-term rehabilitation programme on a voluntary base. Reasons for (non-)attendance were assessed. Frequency and duration of use of the activity-promoting video game sessions were documented. Furthermore, heart rate and activity counts during use of ""apvg"", endurance training, and strength training were measured. Of 84 inpatients, 51 used the ""apvg"" at least once (69%) over the study period. The median weekly use of the intervention was 27. min during the first week (range 0-182. min), declining to zero (range 0-74. min) in week four. Mean heart rate during the sessions (mean 115. bpm; 95% confidence interval 108-122. bpm) was similar to the heart rate during strength training (106. bpm; 101-112. bpm). The results indicate that the video games could have an impact on the activity of obese adolescents and young adults. However, as the interest in the devices seems to be too low the suitability of them for weight reduction programmes in young people cannot be ensured. © 2010 Sports Medicine Australia.",doi,10.1016/j.jsams.2010.07.009,Scopus,Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport,"Radon K., Fürbeck B., Thomas S., Siegfried W., Nowak D., von Kries R.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Field Test For Mechanical Efficiency Evaluation In Matching Volleyball Players,"Field tests were performed in 10 volleyball (VB) players (4 females acid 6 males) in order to obtain an index of mechanical work efficiency (μ' = W(mec)/W(oxy)) while athletes played a game. W(mec) was the mechanical work output, obtained by means of home made video image analysis software, by summing potential, kinetic translational and kinetic rotational energies of running and jumping athletes. W(oxy) was the oxidative energy consumption obtained from O2 consumption (V̇O2) by a telemetry device (Cosmed K2) that also gave values of pulmonary ventilation (V̇(E)) and heart rate (HR). VB were studied at rest before a game (R), during attacking phases (A) and during defensive phases (D). At R were found: V̇(E) = 11 ± 1 l·min-1, HR = 78 ± 7b·min-1, V̇O2 = 3.71 ± 1.1 ml·kg-1·min-1, W(oxy) = 75.1 ± 22.3 J·kg-1·min-1. During A all variables increased: V̇(E) = 49 ± 6 l·min-1, HR = 149 ± 15 b·min-1, V̇O2 = 23.1 ± 3.3 ml·kg-1·min-1, W(oxy) = 482.8 ± 69.0 J·kg-1·min-1, and W(mec) 275.5 ± 57.0 J·kg-1·min-1 with μ' = 0.57 ± 0.09. In D HR (-9%), V̇(E), V̇O2 and W(oxy) (-18%) were reduced when compared to A, decreasing μ' to 0.21 ± 0.05. On the other hand μ' was found higher than 0.25 during A indicating an anaerobic contribution to energy expenditure; in D the μ' lower than 0.25 indicated a restoration of anaerobic energy sources. It might be proposed that a greater difference in μ' values between A and D also means a higher anaerobic energy contribution to the volleyball game.",doi,10.1055/s-2007-971880,Scopus,International Journal of Sports Medicine,"Laconi P., Melis F., Crisafulli A., Sollai R., Lai C., Concu A.",1998,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Fitness Field Tests' Correlation With Game Performance In U-19-Category Basketball Referees,"Purpose: To examine the relation between game performance, physiological responses, and field-test results in Tunisian basketball referees. Methods: Computerized time-motion analysis, heart rate (HR), and blood lactate concentration [La-] were measured in 15 referees during 8 competitive games (under-19-y-old Tunisian league). Referees also performed a repeated-sprint test (RSA), Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Test level 1 (YYIRTL1), agility T-test, and 30-m sprint with 10-m lap time. Computerized video analysis determined the time spent in 5 locomotor activities (standing, walking, jogging, running, and sprint), then grouped in high-, moderate-, and low-intensity activities (HIAs, MIAs, and LIAs, respectively). Results: YYIRTL1 performance correlated with (1) total distance covered during the 4th quarter (r =.52, P =.04) and (2) distance covered in LIA during all game periods (P &lt;.05). Both distance covered and time spent in MIA during the 1st quarter were negatively correlated with the YYIRTL1 performance (r = -.53, P =.035; r = -.67, P =.004, respectively). A negative correlation was found between distance covered at HIA during the 2nd half (3rd quarter + 4th quarter) and fatigue index of the RSA test (r = -.54, P =.029). Mean HR (expressed as %HRpeak) during all game periods was correlated with YYIRTL1 performance (.61 ≤ r &lt;.67, P &lt;.01). Conclusions: This study showed that (1) the YYIRTL1 performance is a moderate predictor of game physical performance in U-19 basketball referees and (2) referees' RSA correlates with the amount of HIA performed during the 2nd half, which represents the ability to keep up with play. © 2016 Human Kinetics, Inc.",doi,10.1123/ijspp.2015-0276,Scopus,International Journal of Sports Physiology and Performance,"Nabli M.A., Ben Abdelkrim N., Jabri I., Batikh T., Castagna C., Chamari K.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Fmri Study Of Social Anxiety During Social Ostracism With And Without Emotional Support,"Social anxiety is characterized by an excessive fear of being embarrassed in social interactions or social performance situations. Emotional support can help to decrease or diminish social distress. Such support may play an important role at different points of social interaction. However, it is unclear how the beneficial effects of social support are represented in the brains of socially anxious individuals. To explore this, we used the same paradigm previously used to examine the effects of emotional support on social pain caused by exclusion. Undergraduates (n = 46) showing a wide range of social anxiety scores underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while participating in a Cyberball game. Participants were initially included and later excluded from the game. In the latter half of the session in which participants were excluded, they were provided with supportive messages. In line with our previous work, we found that social exclusion led to increased anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activity, whereas emotional support led to increased left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) activity. Despite validation of the paradigm, social anxiety was not associated with increased ACC activity during social exclusion, or during perceived emotional support. Instead, fear of negative evaluation as assessed by the Brief Fear of Negative Evaluation (BFNE) scale showed positive associations with left DLPFC activation while receiving emotional support, compared to while being socially excluded. The more socially anxious an individual was, the greater was the left DLPFC activity increased during receipt of messages. This suggests that highly socially anxious people still have the ability to perceive social support, but that they are nevertheless susceptible to negative evaluation by others. © 2015 Nishiyama et al.

Arousal was manipulated by having subjects play an exciting, neutral, or boring video game. In line with predictions from optimal level of arousal theories, subjects chose more novel foods when manipulated arousal was low (vs. neutral) and fewer novel foods when manipulated arousal was high (vs. neutral). There was no main effect of individual differences in optimal level of arousal as assessed by the Sensation Seeking Scale; however, an interaction between the two independent variables revealed high-sensation seekers to try more novel foods than lows under conditions of low arousal.",doi,10.1016/S0031-9384(96)00406-4,Scopus,Physiology and Behavior,"Pliner P., Melo N.",1997,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Frontal Midline Theta Rhythm And Eyeblinking Activity During A Vdt Task And A Video Game: Useful Tools For Psychophysiology In Ergonomics,"The necessity of psychophysiological research in ergonomics has gradually been recognized in Japan. In this paper, frontal midline theta rhythm (Fm-theta) and eyeblinking are recommended as tools in this field, especially for assessing workers' attention concentration, mental workload, fatigue, and interest during VDT work at the workplace and playing video games at home. In experiment 1, Fm-theta and eyeblink rates were measured in 10 Japanese abacus experts (Group E) and 10 normal students (Group C) during a visual search task with VDT. Memory load affected all measures. The amount of Fm-theta appeared more in Group E than Group C, but blink rate was lower in Group E than in Group C, As abacus experts have such highly developed skills in concentration, the result indicates that the amount of Fm-theta would be a good index of attention concentration in VDT workers. The second experiment was done with 10 school-aged children as subjects during three visual tasks: video game, mental test and animation. Amounts of Fm-theta and the degree of blink inhibition were maximum while playing the video game, which all subjects reported they most preferred, and minimum while watching animation, which eight subjects reported to be most boring. An interesting task would seem to provoke Fm-theta and inhibit eyeblink activity. From these two experiments, Fm-theta and eyeblink rate would appear to be good indices of attention concentration and task pleasantness of a mental task using VDT.The necessity of psychophysiological research in ergonomics has gradually been recognized in Japan.

,Functional Mri Of The Amygdala And Bed Nucleus Of The Stria Terminalis During Conditions Of Uncertainty In Generalized Anxiety Disorder,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a common psychiatric disorder characterized by constant worry or anxiety over every day life activities and events. The neurobiology of the disorder is thought to involve a wide cortical and subcortical network that includes but is not limited to the amygdala and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). These two regions have been hypothesized to play different roles in stress and anxiety; the amygdala is thought to regulate responses to brief emotional stimuli while the BNST is thought to be involved in more chronic regulation of sustained anxiety. In this study, we exposed medication-free GAD patients as well as non-anxious controls to a gambling game where one of the conditions involved non-contingent monetary loss. This condition of high uncertainty was intended to elicit a stressful response and sustained anxiety. Functional MRI scans were collected simultaneously to investigate BOLD activity in the amygdala and BNST during performance of this task. Compared to controls, we found that GAD patients demonstrated decreased activity in the amygdala and increased activity in the BNST. Skin conductance measures showed a consistent early versus late effect within block where GAD patients demonstrated higher arousal than controls late in the task blocks. Based on these results, we hypothesize that GAD patients disengage the amygdala and its response to acute stress earlier than non-anxious controls making way for the BNST to maintain a more sustained response. Future studies are needed to investigate the temporal dynamics of activation and deactivation in these regions. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.jpsychires.2012.04.013,Scopus,Journal of Psychiatric Research,"Yassa M.A., Hazlett R.L., Stark C.E.L., Hoehn-Saric R.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Futsal Match-Related Fatigue Affects Running Performance And Neuromuscular Parameters But Not Finishing Kick Speed Or Accuracy,"Purpose: The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of futsal match-related fatigue on running performance, neuromuscular variables, and finishing kick speed and accuracy. Methods: Ten professional futsal players participated in the study (age: 22.2 ± 2.5 years) and initially performed an incremental protocol to determine maximum oxygen uptake (V.O2max: 50.6 ± 4.9 mL.kg-1.min-1). Next, simulated games were performed, in four periods of 10 min during which heart rate and blood lactate concentration were monitored. The entire games were video recorded for subsequent automatic tracking. Before and immediately after the simulated game, neuromuscular function was measured by maximal isometric force of knee extension, voluntary activation using twitch interpolation technique, and electromyographic activity. Before, at half time, and immediately after the simulated game, the athletes also performed a set of finishing kicks for ball speed and accuracy measurements. Results: Total distance covered (1st half: 1986.6 ± 74.4 m; 2nd half: 1856.0 ± 129.7 m, P = 0.00) and distance covered per minute (1st half: 103.2 ± 4.4 m.min-1; 2nd half: 96.4 ± 7.5 m.min-1, P = 0.00) demonstrated significant declines during the simulated game, as well as maximal isometric force of knee extension (Before: 840.2 ± 66.2 N; After: 751.6 ± 114.3 N, P = 0.04) and voluntary activation (Before: 85.9 ± 7.5%; After: 74.1 ± 12.3%, P = 0.04), however ball speed and accuracy during the finishing kicks were not significantly affected. Conclusion: Therefore, we conclude that despite the decline in running performance and neuromuscular variables presenting an important manifestation of central fatigue, this condition apparently does not affect the speed and accuracy of finishing kicks. © 2016 Milioni, Vieira, Barbieri, Zagatto, Nordsborg, Barbieri, dos-Santos, Santiago and Papoti.",doi,10.3389/fphys.2016.00518,Scopus,Frontiers in Physiology,"Milioni F., Vieira L.H.P., Barbieri R.A., Zagatto A.M., Nordsborg N.B., Barbieri F.A., dos-Santos J.W., Santiago R.R.P., Papoti M.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Game-Theoretic Mechanisms To Increase Data Availability In Decentralized Storage Systems,"In a decentralized storage system, agents replicate each other's data to increase availability. Compared to organizationally centralized solutions, such as cloud storage, a decentralized storage system requires less trust in the provider and may result in smaller monetary costs. Our system is based on reciprocal storage contracts that allow the agents to adopt to changes in their replication partners' availability (by dropping inefficient contracts and forming new contracts with other partners). The data availability provided by the system is a function of the participating agents' availability. However, a straightforward system in which agents' matching is decentralized uses the given agent availability inefficiently. As agents are autonomous, the highly available agents form cliques replicating data between each other, which makes the system too hostile for the weakly available newcomers. In contrast, a centralized, equitable matching is not incentive compatible: it does not reward users for keeping their software running. We solve this dilemma by a mixed solution: an ""adoption"" mechanism in which highly available agents donate some replication space, which in turn is used to help the worst-off agents. We show that the adoption motivates agents to increase their availability (is incentive-compatible), but also that it is sufficient for acceptable data availability for weakly-available agents. © 2015 ACM.",doi,10.1145/2723771,Scopus,ACM Transactions on Autonomous and Adaptive Systems,"Rzadca K., Datta A., Kreitz G., Buchegger S.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Game Analysis And Energy Requirements Of Elite Squash,"Girard, O., R. Chevalier, M. Habrard, P. Sciberras, P. Hot, and G.P. Millet. Game analysis and energy requirements of elite squash. J. Strength Cond. Res. 21(3):909-914.2007. - The aim of this study was to describe the game characteristics and energy requirement in elite squash. Seven players (ranked 1-25 in their national federation, including the world number 1) performed a squash-specific incremental test to volitional exhaustion and 3 squash ga mes simulating competition. Pulmonary gas exchanges, heart ra te (HR), and blood lactate concentration ([LA]) were recorded by portable analyzers. Energy expenditure (EEV̇o2 ) was evaluated by indirect calorimetry. Temporal structure was determined from video recordings. The mean oxygen uptake (V̇o2), HR, EEV̇o2, and [LA] were 54.4 ± 4.8 ml·min-1·kg-1 (86 ± 9% of V̇o2max reached in the incremental squash test), 177 ± 10 beats·min-1 (92 ± 3% of HRmax), 4,933 ± 620 kJ·h-1, and 8.3 ± 3.4 mmol·L-1, respectively. Time spent &gt;90% of V̇o3max and HRmax was 24 ± 29% and 69 ± 18% of the total match duration, respectively. [LA] was correlated (R = 0.87; p = 0.01) with time spent &gt;90% of V̇o 2max. The mean rally duration yielded 18.6 ± 4.6 s, and 34.6% of the rallies were &lt;10 s, and 32.6% were &gt;21 s. The effective playing time was 69.7 ± 4.7%. World-standard squash is predominantly a high-intensity aerobic activity with great emphasize on the anaerobic energy systems and a high uncertainty in the course of match play. To improve squash results, coaches should plan training according to the characteristics of the sport. By showing the contribution of the different energy pathways and variables easily controllable during training sessions (e.g., HR, rally duration, lactate), the accurate prescription of conditioning session is improved. © 2007 National Strength &amp; Conditioning Association.",doi,10.1519/R-20306.1,Scopus,Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research,"Girard O., Chevalier R., Habrard M., Sciberras P., Hot P., Millet G.P.",2007,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Game Theoretic Analysis Of Cooperation Stimulation And Security In Autonomous Mobile Ad Hoc Networks,"In autonomous mobile ad hoc networks, nodes belong to different authorities and pursue different goals; therefore, cooperation among them cannot be taken for granted. Meanwhile, some nodes may be malicious, whose objective is to damage the network. In this paper, we present a joint analysis of cooperation stimulation and security in autonomous mobile ad hoc networks under a game theoretic framework. We first investigate a simple yet illuminating two-player packet forwarding game and derive the optimal and cheat-proof packet forwarding strategies. We then investigate the secure routing and packet forwarding game for autonomous ad hoc networks in noisy and hostile environments and derive a set of reputation-based cheat-proof and attack-resistant cooperation stimulation strategies. When analyzing the cooperation strategies, besides Nash equilibrium, other optimality criteria, such as Pareto optimality, subgame perfection, fairness, and cheat-proofing, have also been considered. Both analysis and simulation studies have shown that the proposed strategies can effectively stimulate cooperation among selfish nodes in autonomous mobile ad hoc networks under noise and attacks, and the damage that can be caused by attackers is bounded and limited. © 2007 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TMC.2007.1026,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,"Yu W., Liu K.J.R.",2007,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,"Get Angry, Get Out: The Interpersonal Effects Of Anger Communication In Multiparty Negotiation","Research on multiparty negotiation has investigated how parties form coalitions to secure payoffs but has not addressed how emotions may affect such coalition decisions. Extending research on bilateral negotiations which has generally argued that it is beneficial to communicate anger, we argue that it constitutes a considerable risk when there are more than two people present at the negotiation table. Using a computer-mediated coalition game we show that communicating anger is a risky strategy in multiparty bargaining. The main findings of three studies were that participants: (1) form negative impressions of players who communicate anger and therefore (2) exclude such players from coalitions and from obtaining a payoff share, but (3) make considerable concessions on those rare occasions that they choose to form a coalition with an angry player, or (4) when they had to form a coalition with an angry player. We discuss the implications of these results for theorizing on emotions, negotiations, and coalition formation. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

,Globalization In The World Of Finance: An Analytical History,"One of the many definitions of financial globalization is integration of domestic financial system of a country with the global financial markets and institutions. Enabling framework of financial globalization essentially includes liberalization and deregulation of the domestic financial sector as well as liberalization of the capital account. As economies progressively integrate globally, pari passu the financial structures of markets and the world of finance change. Financial globalization cannot be considered a novel phenomenon. Trans-country capital movements are centuries old. The oil shock of 1973 and the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, both of these developments were momentous and were responsible for laying the foundation of the contemporary era of financial globalization. After the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, some middle-income developing economies began to liberalize and open up for greater capital mobility, while keeping an autonomous control over their monetary policy. Advances in IT and computer technology are cited as one of the most important factors driving and supporting financial globalization. Transnational corporations (TNCs) also helped in global financial integration. They expanded their networks by merging with or acquiring other national and international firms. The prime movers in financial globalization are governments, borrowers, investors, and financial institutions. Each one of these market participants propelled economies towards financial integration in a proactive manner. Financial globalization has caused dramatic changes in the structure of national and international capital markets. The most significant change in the capital markets was in the banking system, which went through a process of dis-intermediation. This was a market transformation of fundamental nature. Contagions and crises are the downsides of financial globalization. Economic and financial crises of the 1990s portend to the fact that financial globalization is not a win-win game, and that it can potentially lead to serious disorder and high cost in terms of bank failures, corporate bankruptcies, stock market turbulence, depletion of foreign exchange reserves, currency depreciation and increased fiscal burden. A unique characteristic of globalized financial markets is reversal of capital flows when market perception regarding the creditworthiness of the borrowing entity changes. Cross-country financial flows to the emerging market economies were low, at during the mid-1970s. They increased at a healthy clip during the decades of 1980s and 1990s, peaking in 1997. They suffered a sharp decline after that because of the Asian and Russian financial and economic crises. The composition of external capital underwent a dramatic transformation during this period. Official flows either stagnated or declined. As a result their relative significance in global capital flows dwindled. In their place, private capital flows became the major source of external finance for a good number of emerging market economies. FDI became an important and dependable source of finance for the emerging markets and other middle-income economies during the decade of the 1980s and 1990s. Portfolio investment in stocks and bond markets also increased substantially. Global institutional investors found this channel of investment functional and profitable. Mutual funds, insurance companies, and pension funds channeled large amounts through portfolio investment into the emerging market economies. As financial globalization progressed, presence of international financial intermediaries has expanded considerably. This applies more to international commercial banks than to investment banks, insurance companies and mutual funds. It is incorrect to say that their global expansion has been uniform because this has occurred unevenly. International bond issuance activity by emerging market economies recorded a sharp spurt in 1993. Emerging market economies began using ADRs and GDRs for raising capital from the global capital markets in 1990 in a small way. Copyright © 2006 The Berkeley Electronic Press.

,"Graphic Gambling Warnings: How They Affect Emotions, Cognitive Responses And Attitude Change","The present study focuses on the effects of graphic warnings related to excessive gambling. It is based upon a theoretical model derived from both the Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) and the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM). We focus on video lottery terminal (VLT), one of the most hazardous format in the gaming industry. Our cohort consisted of 103 actual gamblers who reported previous gambling activity on VLT's on a regular basis. We assess the effectiveness of graphic warnings vs. text-only warnings and the effectiveness of two major arguments (i.e., family vs. financial disruption). A 2 × 2 factorial design was used to test the direct and combined effects of two variables (i.e., warning content and presence vs. absence of a graphic). It was found that the presence of a graphic enhances both cognitive appraisal and fear, and has positive effects on the Depth of Information Processing. In addition, graphic content combined with family disruptions is more effective for changing attitudes and complying with the warning than other combinations of the manipulated variables. It is proposed that ELM and PMT complement each other to explain the effects of warnings. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",doi,10.1007/s10899-012-9319-8,Scopus,Journal of Gambling Studies,"Muñoz Y., Chebat J.-C., Borges A.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Having To Versus Wanting To Play: Background And Consequences Of Harmonious Versus Obsessive Engagement In Video Games,"The present research examined the background and consequences of different styles of engagement in video game play. Based on self-determination theory 1 and the dualistic model of passion,2 the authors hypothesized that high levels of basic psychological need satisfaction would foster harmonious passion for video play, supporting the subjective sense that play is something one wants to do. It was also predicted that low levels of need satisfaction would promote obsessive passion for games and contribute to the feeling that game play is something one feels compelled to or has to do. It was expected, in turn, that passion for play would directly influence player outcomes closely tied to games, moderate links between play and well-being, and relate to overall levels of well-being as a function of basic need satisfaction. As expected, results showed that low levels of basic need satisfaction were associated with more obsessive passion, higher amounts of play, greater tension following play, and low game enjoyment, whereas high levels of need satisfaction did not predict hours of play but were associated with more harmonious passion, game enjoyment, and energy following play. Moderation analyses showed that high amounts of play related negatively to well-being only to the extent that players reported an obsessive passion and that the unique relations between passion and overall levels of player well-being were quite small once controlling for their basic need satisfaction in daily life. Discussion of the current findings focuses on their significance for understanding disordered play and the value of applying a theory-based approach to study motivation for virtual contexts. © 2009 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",doi,10.1089/cpb.2009.0083,Scopus,Cyberpsychology and Behavior,"Przybylski A.K., Weinstein N., Ryan R.M., Rigby C.S.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Hci2 Framework:\ A Software Framework For Multimodal Human-Computer Interaction Systems,"This paper presents a novel software framework for the development and research in the area of multimodal human-computer interface (MHCI) systems. The proposed software framework, which is called the HCI2 Framework, is built upon publish/subscribe (P/S) architecture. It implements a shared-memory-based data transport protocol for message delivery and a TCP-based system management protocol. The latter ensures that the integrity of system structure is maintained at runtime. With the inclusion of bridging modules, the HCI2 Framework is interoperable with other software frameworks including Psyclone and ActiveMQ. In addition to the core communication middleware, we also present the integrated development environment (IDE) of the HCI2 Framework. It provides a complete graphical environment to support every step in a typical MHCI system development process, including module development, debugging, packaging, and management, as well as the whole system management and testing. The quantitative evaluation indicates that our framework outperforms other similar tools in terms of average message latency and maximum data throughput under a typical single PC scenario. To demonstrate HCI2 Framework's capabilities in integrating heterogeneous modules, we present several example modules working with a variety of hardware and software. We also present an example of a full system developed using the proposed HCI2 Framework, which is called the CamGame system and represents a computer game based on hand-held marker(s) and low-cost camera(s). © 2013 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TCYB.2013.2271563,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,"Shen J., Pantic M.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Health Self-Advocacy Training For Persons With Intellectual Disabilities,"Background: People with intellectual disabilities (ID) have unequal access to health care. While systemic efforts are addressing health inequalities, there remains a need to demonstrate that persons with ID can increase their health self-advocacy skills. Method: A randomised control design with up to 6-month follow-up was used to evaluate the 3Rs (Rights, Respect and Responsibility) health self-advocacy training program for persons with ID (n=31). Training involved teaching participants to recognise and redress health rights violations in the context of respect and responsibility. Training materials included PowerPoint slides and interactive video scenarios illustrating health rights, respect and responsibility problem and non-problems. Two-hour training sessions were conducted twice a week in a group format where participants played a game and answered questions. Results: The health rights training group made significantly more correct responses on post training and follow-up tests than the control group. Training effects generalised to untrained scenarios and in situ health interviews. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that persons with ID can learn complex skills related to health self-advocacy. More research is needed to improve in situ generalisation. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",doi,10.1111/j.1365-2788.2012.01626.x,Scopus,Journal of Intellectual Disability Research,"Feldman M.A., Owen F., Andrews A., Hamelin J., Barber R., Griffiths D.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,"Heart Rate And Liking During ""Kinect Boxing"" Versus ""Wii Boxing"": The Potential For Enjoyable Vigorous Physical Activity Videogames","Objective: Nintendo® (Kyoto, Japan) ""Wii™ Sports Boxing"" (""Wii Boxing"") and Xbox® (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) ""Kinect® Sports Boxing"" (""Kinect Boxing"") are both boxing simulation videogames that are available for two different active videogame (AVG) systems. Although these AVGs are similar, the style of gameplay required is different (i.e., upper body only versus total body movements) and may alter physical activity intensity and one's preference for playing one game over the other. AVGs that elicit the greatest physiologic challenge and are preferred by users should be identified in an effort to enhance the efficacy of physical activity interventions and programs that include AVGs. Materials and Methods: The mean heart rate (HRmean) and peak heart rate (HRpeak) for 27 adults (22.7±4.2 years old) were recorded during four 10-minute conditions: seated rest, treadmill walking at 3 miles/hour, ""Wii Boxing,"" and ""Kinect Boxing."" Upon completion of all four conditions, participants indicated which condition they preferred, and HRmean and HRpeak were calculated as a percentage of age-predicted maximum heart rate to classify physical activity intensity for the three activity conditions (treadmill, ""Wii Boxing,"" and ""Kinect Boxing""). Results: ""Kinect Boxing"" significantly (P&lt;0.001) increased percentage HRmean (64.1±1.6 percent of age-predicted maximum) and percentage HRpeak (76.5±1.9 percent) above all other conditions: Wii HRmean, 53.0±1.2 percent; Wii HRpeak, 61.8±1.5 percent; treadmill HRmean, 52.4±1.2 percent; treadmill HRpeak, 55.2±2.2 percent. Percentage HRpeak for ""Kinect Boxing"" was great enough to be considered a vigorous-intensity physical activity. There was no difference (P=0.55) in percentage HRmean between ""Wii Boxing"" and treadmill walking. Participants also preferred ""Kinect Boxing"" (P&lt;0.001; n=26) to all other conditions (""Wii Boxing,"" n=1; treadmill n=0). Conclusions: ""Kinect Boxing"" was the most preferred and the only condition that was physiologically challenging enough to be classified as a vigorous-intensity physical activity. © Copyright 2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2015.",doi,10.1089/g4h.2014.0068,Scopus,Games for Health Journal,"Sanders G.J., Peacock C.A., Barkley J.E., Gish B., Brock S., Volpenhein J.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Heart Rate And Perceived Exertion During Self-Selected Intensities For Exergaming Compared To Traditional Exercise In College-Age Participants,"Exergames may be useful for promoting physical activity in younger populations. Heart rate (HRs) responses and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) at selfselected intensities were compared in college-age participants during 2 modes of exergame activity vs. traditional exercise. Thirty-seven participants (men: 20, women: 17) completed 3 30-minute self-selected intensity trials: (a) video game interactive bicycle ergometer (GB) (CatEye GB300), (b) interactive video dance game (Dance Dance Revolution [DDR]), and (c) traditional cycle ergometer (CE) while watching television. Mean HR, peak HR (PkHR), and minutes above target HR (THR) were significantly higher for GB (144 ± 22 b·min-1 [57% HR reserve (HRR)], 161 ± 23 b·min-1, and 22.5 ± 11.1 minutes) than for DDR (119 ± 16 b·min-1 [37% HRR], 138 ± 20 b·min-1, and 11.2 ± 11.9 minutes) or for CE (126 ± 20 b·min-1 [42% HRR], 1446 24 b·min -1, and 14.2 ± 12.6 minutes). The RPE was significantly higher for GB (4.2 ± 1.5) and CE (3.8 ± 1.2) than for DDR (2.7 ± 1.3). Recovery HR (RecHR) (15 minutes postexercise) was significantly higher for GB (91 ± 14 b·min-1) than for DDR (80 ± 11 b·min-1) and neared significance vs. CE (84 ± 14 b·min-1, p = 0.059). No difference in PkHR, RecHR, or minutes above THR was observed between DDR and CE. Session RPE was significantly higher for GB (4.6 ± 1.7) and CE (4.1 ± 1.6) than for DDR (2.8 ± 1.5). All modes elicited extended proportions of time above THR; GB: 75%, DDR: 37%, and CE: 47%. Results support that exergames are capable of eliciting physiological responses necessary for fitness improvements.

,Hedonic Coalition Formation For Distributed Task Allocation Among Wireless Agents,"Autonomous wireless agents such as unmanned aerial vehicles, mobile base stations, cognitive devices, or self-operating wireless nodes present a great potential for deployment in next-generation wireless networks. While current literature has been mainly focused on the use of agents within robotics or software engineering applications, this paper proposes a novel usage model for self-organizing agents suitable for wireless communication networks. In the proposed model, a number of agents are required to collect data from several arbitrarily located tasks. Each task represents a queue of packets that require collection and subsequent wireless transmission by the agents to a central receiver. The problem is modeled as a hedonic coalition formation game between the agents and the tasks that interact in order to form disjoint coalitions. Each formed coalition is modeled as a polling system consisting of a number of agents, designated as collectors, which move between the different tasks present in the coalition, collect and transmit the packets. Within each coalition, some agents might also take the role of a relay for improving the packet success rate of the transmission. The proposed hedonic coalition formation algorithm allows the tasks and the agents to take distributed decisions to join or leave a coalition, based on the achieved benefit in terms of effective throughput, and the cost in terms of polling system delay. As a result of these decisions, the agents and tasks structure themselves into independent disjoint coalitions which constitute a Nash-stable network partition. Moreover, the proposed coalition formation algorithm allows the agents and tasks to adapt the topology to environmental changes, such as the arrival of new tasks, the removal of existing tasks, or the mobility of the tasks. Simulation results show how the proposed algorithm allows the agents and tasks to self-organize into independent coalitions, while improving the performance, in terms of average player (agent or task) payoff, of at least 30.26 percent (for a network of five agents with up to 25 tasks) relatively to a scheme that allocates nearby tasks equally among agents. © 2011 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TMC.2010.242,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,"Saad W., Han Z., Basar T., Debbah M., Hjorungnes A.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,How Color Properties Can Be Used To Elicit Emotions In Video Games,"Classifying the many types of video games is difficult, as their genres and supports are different, but they all have in common that they seek the commitment of the player through exciting emotions and challenges. Since the income of the video game industry exceeds that of the film industry, the field of inducting emotions through video games and virtual environments is attracting more attention. Our theory, widely supported by substantial literature, is that the chromatic stimuli intensity, brightness, and saturation of a video game environment produce an emotional effect on players. We have observed a correlation between the RGB additives color spaces, HSV, HSL, and HSI components of video game images, presented to n=85 participants, and the emotional statements expressed in terms of arousal and valence, recovered in a subjective semantic questionnaire. Our results show a significant correlation between luminance, saturation, lightness, and the emotions of joy, sadness, fear, and serenity experienced by participants viewing 24 video game images. We also show strong correlations between the colorimetric diversity, saliency volume, and stimuli conspicuity and the emotions expressed by the players. These results allow us to propose video game environment development methods in the form of a circumplex model. It is aimed at game designers for developing emotional color scripting. © 2016 Erik Geslin et al.",doi,10.1155/2016/5182768,Scopus,International Journal of Computer Games Technology,"Geslin E., Jégou L., Beaudoin D.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Human-Computer Interface Studies For Semi-Autonomous Unmanned Surface Vessels,"A series of four experiments were performed during an iterative design evolution of the human-computer interface (HCI) to a small unmanned surface vehicle (USV). The baseline control system was compared to several alternate designs using a simulated naval mission. User tasks included the monitoring and control of one or two vessels simultaneously. Faults and hazards were included to stimulate emergency responses during vessel transit. Alternate HCI designs varied across these factors: visual integration, synthetic audio feedback, sizing and placement of alerts, and use of a hand-held game controller as a primary input device. Results for N=32 sailors across the four studies indicated that for single or dual USV control conditions, the interface features added to the baseline design significantly improved speed and accuracy across multiple mission tasks. However, all design configurations still yielded some collision errors indicating that operator visual monitoring and manual control may be inadequate in complex, cluttered transit environments. Therefore, on-board automatic obstacle avoidance systems may be needed to safely support multiple vessel operations in cluttered complex transit environments. © 2015 The Authors",doi,10.1016/j.promfg.2015.07.154,Scopus,Procedia Manufacturing,"Osga G.A., McWilliams M.R.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Human-Robot Communication For Collaborative Decision Making - A Probabilistic Approach,"Humans and robots need to exchange information if the objective is to achieve a task collaboratively. Two questions are considered in this paper: what and when to communicate. To answer these questions, we developed a human-robot communication framework which makes use of common probabilistic robotics representations. The data stored in the representation determines what to communicate, and probabilistic inference mechanisms determine when to communicate. One application domain of the framework is collaborative human-robot decision making: robots use decision theory to select actions based on perceptual information gathered from their sensors and human operators. In this paper, operators are regarded as remotely located, valuable information sources which need to be managed carefully. Robots decide when to query operators using Value-Of-Information theory, i.e. humans are only queried if the expected benefit of their observation exceeds the cost of obtaining it. This can be seen as a mechanism for adjustable autonomy whereby adjustments are triggered at run-time based on the uncertainty in the robots' beliefs related to their task. This semi-autonomous system is demonstrated using a navigation task and evaluated by a user study. Participants navigated a robot in simulation using the proposed system and via classical teleoperation. Results show that our system has a number of advantages over teleoperation with respect to performance, operator workload, usability, and the users' perception of the robot. We also show that despite these advantages, teleoperation may still be a preferable driving mode depending on the mission priorities.

,Human - Agent Teaming For Multirobot Control: A Review Of Human Factors Issues,"The human factors literature on intelligent systems was reviewed in relation to the following: efficient human supervision of multiple robots, appropriate human trust in the automated systems, maintenance of human operator's situation awareness, individual differences in human-agent (H-A) interaction, and retention of human decision authority. A number of approaches - from flexible automation to autonomous agents - were reviewed, and their advantages and disadvantages were discussed. In addition, two key human performance issues (trust and situation awareness) related to H-A teaming for multirobot control and some promising user interface design solutions to address these issues were discussed. Some major individual differences factors (operator spatial ability, attentional control ability, and gaming experience) were identified that may impact H-A teaming in the context of robotics control. © 2014 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/THMS.2013.2293535,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems,"Chen J.Y.C., Barnes M.J.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Human Pose Estimation And Activity Recognition From Multi-View Videos: Comparative Explorations Of Recent Developments,"This paper presents a review and comparative study of recent multi-view approaches for human 3D pose estimation and activity recognition. We discuss the application domain of human pose estimation and activity recognition and the associated requirements, covering: advanced human-computer interaction (HCI), assisted living, gesture-based interactive games, intelligent driver assistance systems, movies, 3D TV and animation, physical therapy, autonomous mental development, smart environments, sport motion analysis, video surveillance, and video annotation. Next, we review and categorize recent approaches which have been proposed to comply with these requirements. We report a comparison of the most promising methods for multi-view human action recognition using two publicly available datasets: the INRIA Xmas Motion Acquisition Sequences (IXMAS) Multi-View Human Action Dataset, and the i3DPost Multi-View Human Action and Interaction Dataset. To compare the proposed methods, we give a qualitative assessment of methods which cannot be compared quantitatively, and analyze some prominent 3D pose estimation techniques for application, where not only the performed action needs to be identified but a more detailed description of the body pose and joint configuration. Finally, we discuss some of the shortcomings of multi-view camera setups and outline our thoughts on future directions of 3D body pose estimation and human action recognition. © 2012 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/JSTSP.2012.2196975,Scopus,IEEE Journal on Selected Topics in Signal Processing,"Holte M.B., Tran C., Trivedi M.M., Moeslund T.B.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Humans Deceived By Predatory Stealth Strategy Camouflaging Motion.,"Motion camouflage is a stealth strategy that allows a predator to conceal its apparent motion as it approaches a moving prey. Although male hoverflies have been observed to move in a manner consistent with motion camouflage to track females, the successful application of the technique has not previously been demonstrated. This article describes the implementation and results of a psychophysical experiment suggesting that humans are susceptible to motion camouflage. The experiment masqueraded as a computer-game competition. The basis of the competition was a game designed to test the comparative success of different predatory-approach strategies. The experiment showed that predators were able to approach closer to their prey (the player of the game) before being detected when using motion camouflage than when using other approach strategies tested. For an autonomous predator, the calculation of a motion-camouflage approach is a non-trivial problem. It was, therefore, of particular interest that in the game the players were deceived by motion-camouflage predators controlled by artificial neural systems operating using realistic levels of input information. It is suggested that these results are especially of interest to biologists, visual psychophysicists, military engineers and computer-games designers.",doi,10.1098/rsbl.2003.0030,pubmed,Proceedings.

,Imitation Learning Of Car Driving Skills With Decision Trees And Random Forests,"Machine learning is an appealing and useful approach to creating vehicle control algorithms, both for simulated and real vehicles. One common learning scenario that is often possible to apply is learning by imitation, in which the behavior of an exemplary driver provides training instances for a supervised learning algorithm. This article follows this approach in the domain of simulated car racing, using the TORCS simulator. In contrast to most prior work on imitation learning, a symbolic decision tree knowledge representation is adopted, which combines potentially high accuracy with human readability, an advantage that can be important in many applications. Decision trees are demonstrated to be capable of representing high quality control models, reaching the performance level of sophisticated pre-designed algorithms. This is achieved by enhancing the basic imitation learning scenario to include active retraining, automatically triggered on control failures. It is also demonstrated how better stability and generalization can be achieved by sacrificing human-readability and using decision tree model ensembles. The methodology for learning control models contributed by this article can be hopefully applied to solve real-world control tasks, as well as to develop video game bots. © 2014 by Paweł Cichosz.",doi,10.2478/amcs-2014-0042,Scopus,International Journal of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science,"Cichosz P., Pawełczak L.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas

In 2 experiments, college students were randomly assigned to play violent or less violent videogames. They then read a series of criminal vignettes and assigned prison sentences to violent criminals. In the second experiment, participants returned 1 hr later and completed a second series of vignettes. A significant interaction between gender and videogame was found in both experiments. Men who played the violent game gave more lenient sentences to criminals than did those who played the less violent game. In the second experiment, women, unlike men, assigned harsher sentences after playing the violent game. The effects were found to persist for at least 1 hr.",doi,10.1111/j.1559-1816.2003.tb01962.x,anderson2010,Journal of Applied Social Psychology,"Deselms, J. L., Altman, J.

,Impact Of A Web Based Interactive Simulation Game (Pulse) On Nursing Students' Experience And Performance In Life Support Training - A Pilot Study,"The delivery of effective life support measures is highly associated with the quality, design and implementation of the education that underpins it. Effectively responding to a critical event is a requirement for all nurses illustrating the need for effective educational approaches from pre-registration training through to enhancing and maintaining life support skills after qualification. This paper reports the findings of utilising a web-based multimedia simulation game PULSE (Platform for Undergraduate Life Support Education). The platform was developed to enhance the student experience of life support education, to motivate on-going learning and engagement and to improve psychomotor skills associated with the provision of Intermediate Life Support (ILS) training. Pre training participants played PULSE and during life support training data was collected from an intervention and a control group of final year undergraduate nursing students (N = 34). Quantitative analysis of performance took place and qualitative data was generated from a questionnaire assessing the learning experience. A statistically significant difference was found between the competence the groups displayed in the three skills sets of checking equipment, airway assessment and the safe/effective use of defibrillator at ILS level, and PULSE was positively evaluated as an educational tool when used alongside traditional life support training. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.nedt.2011.09.013,Scopus,Nurse Education Today,"Cook N.F., McAloon T., O'Neill P., Beggs R.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas

,Impaired Social Decision Making In Patients With Major Depressive Disorder,"Background: Abnormal decision-making processes have been observed in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). However, it is unresolved whether MDD patients show abnormalities in decision making in a social interaction context, in which decisions have actual influences on both the self-interests of the decision makers per se and those of their partners.Methods: Using a well-studied ultimatum game (UG), which is frequently used to investigate social interaction behavior, we examined whether MDD can be associated with abnormalities in social decision-making behavior by comparing the acceptance rates of MDD patients (N = 14) with those of normal controls (N = 19).Results: The acceptance rates of the patients were lower than those of the normal controls. Additionally, unfair proposals were accepted at similar rates from computer partners and human partners in the MDD patients, unlike the acceptance rates in the normal controls, who were able to discriminatively treat unfair proposals from computer partners and human partners.Conclusions: Depressed patients show abnormal decision-making behavior in a social interaction context. Several possible explanations, such as increased sensitivity to fairness, negative emotional state and disturbed affective cognition, have been proposed to account for the abnormal social decision-making behavior in patients with MDD. This aberrant social decision-making behavior may provide a new perspective in the search to find biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of MDD. © 2014 Wang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",doi,10.1186/1471-244X-14-18,Scopus,BMC Psychiatry,"Wang Y., Zhou Y., Li S., Wang P., Wu G.-W., Liu Z.-N.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Impaired Stress-Induced Pressure Natriuresis Increases Cardiovascular Load In African American Youths,"Background: We hypothesized that impaired stress-induced pressure natriuresis increases blood pressure (BP) load. Methods: The 118 African American youths were brought into similar levels of sodium balance. The protocol consisted of a 2-h baseline period, a 1-h stress period (competitive video games), and a 2-h recovery period. Results: Normal pressure natriuresis (n = 80) resulted from a resistance-mediated (r = 0.23; P < .03) increase in BP (P < .001). In contrast, impaired pressure natriuresis (n = 38), leading to an extended period of elevated BP (P < .05), resulted from a volume-mediated (r = 0.55; P < .002) increase, in BP (P < .001). Conclusions: Impaired stress-induced pressure natriuresis may contribute to the development of essential hypertension, particularly in African Americans.

,Impaired Stress-Induced Pressure Natriuresis Is Related To Left Ventricle Structure In Blacks,"The mechanisms through which stress may contribute to the racial difference in the prevalence of essential hypertension and associated target organ damage remain unclear. This study examined differences in stress-induced pressure natriuresis in 69 black and 52 white normotensives age 14 to 27 years, all with a positive family history of hypertension. Urine samples for sodium excretion were collected before and after a series of tasks (video game challenge, forehead cold stimulation). The average blood pressure across the 2 tasks and the average increase in blood pressure to the 2 tasks were calculated. Blacks had higher mean systolic (131 ± 12 versus 126 ± 12 mm Hg, P<0.02) and diastolic (77 ± 8 versus 72 ± 9 mm Hg, P<0.001) blood pressure and a greater average change in systolic blood pressure (15 ± 9 versus 11 ± 7 mm Hg, P<0.04). This was associated with a smaller change in sodium excretion (2 ± 6 versus 7 ± 10 mEq/h, P<0.002). The change in sodium excretion was related to the change in systolic (r=0.31, P<0.03) and diastolic (r=0.27, P<0.05) blood pressure in whites but not in blacks. Relative wall thickness was greater in blacks (0.31 ± 0.04 versus 0.29 ± 0.03, P<0.002). In conclusion, impaired stress-induced pressure natriuresis in blacks may contribute to racial differences in essential hypertension and its sequelae.",doi,10.1161/01.HYP.0000013735.85681.74,Scopus,Hypertension,"Harshfield G.A., Treiber F.A., Davis H., Kapuku G.K.",2002,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Implantable Cardiovascular Sensors And Computers: Interventional Heart Failure Strategies,"Despite evidence-basedmedical and pharmacologic advances themanagement of heart failure remains challenging, whether in the ambulatory setting where daily weight monitoring has failed, or in the inpatient setting where readmission rates and morbidity remains high. There is an urgent need to develop strategies to reduce hospitalizations and readmission rates for heart failure in general. There may be a shift in the paradigm with respect to the treatment of heart failure, which may usher in an era of invasive heart failure therapies and specialists.

,Implementation Of A Multiagent Systems For Competitive Environments On The Www,"Agents have been receiving a lot of attention as software which behaves autonomously and efficiently on a network and supports human social interactions. Various agent systems have already been proposed. A conventional agent-based system is based on the assumption that all interacting agents are trustworthy. In practice, however, there are many instances in which agents must compete in an environment in which the other agents cannot be trusted. Thus, in this paper the authors discuss the development of an electronic commerce system which uses agents that behave competitively. The agents in this system can determine autonomously the level of uncertainty in a transaction, then make decisions flexibly. In addition, the authors argue for the validity of their system using operational examples in which their system is used in various market scenarios.",doi,10.1002/scj.10032,Scopus,Systems and Computers in Japan,"Onjo H., Far B.H.",2002,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Implementing Artificial Intelligence: A Generic Approach With Software Support [Tehisintellekti Rakendus: Üldine Lähenemine Koos Tarkvaratoega],"In computer games, one of the eminent trends is to create large virtual worlds with numerous non-player characters. Usually their artificial intelligence (AI) is implemented by scripting, which can be a burden for the application developers involved. This paper suggests an approach facilitating designing AI functionalities and striving to reduce, via software tool support, the amount of hand-written AI script code needed. Our approach is suitable for, e.g., creating autonomous agents with personal characteristics, capable of behaving in a natural manner. For instance, the goal-oriented agent paradigm can be applied easily with the approach. The definitions needed are written using a script language. Therefore, the agent configurations can be tested rapidly. We have extended an existing AI environment and created a script framework for implementing general-purpose AIs. Moreover, we have implemented software tools capable of generating script code for helping in the AI structure design and for simplifying the actual code-writing task. For demonstrating the applicability of our approach, three example scenarios specialized from the framework are presented.",doi,10.3176/proc.2013.1.04,Scopus,Proceedings of the Estonian Academy of Sciences,"Heinimäki T.J., Vanhatupa J.-M.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas

,Induced Mood And Persistence At Gaming,"Aims. Using the affect infusion model (AIM), this study aimed to assess the impact of prior mood on gaming persistence in regular and non-regular gamblers (assumed to be motivated and heuristic decision-makers, respectively). Design, measures and setting. A 2 × 3 experimental design in a laboratory setting employed factors of gambler type (regular, non-regular) and prior mood (happy, neutral, depressed). Measures were number of trials played on a gambling game, and mood ratings (post-mood induction, during and after play). Participants and intervention. Sixty regular and 60 non-regular gamblers (all male students) were assigned randomly to watch a video inducing one of the three mood conditions. They were then given AUD$10.00 to gamble in a computerized card-cutting game. Findings. AIM predictions were supported: prior mood did not affect gaming persistence for regular gamblers, but non-regulars showed reduced persistence across happy, neutral and depressed moods. After-play mood ratings were related to winnings for regulars, and losing regulars were significantly more unhappy after-play compared to during-play, and compared to both their winning counterparts and non-regulars. Mood and winnings were unrelated for non-regulars, with little during- to after-play mood change. Conclusions. The findings speak to depression as a causal factor in addictive gambling. Depressed mood did not enhance persistence in regular gamblers, but rather failed to have the inhibitory effect observed in non-regular gamblers. Evidence of mood changes during gambling was obtained, although multiple measures (self-report, physiological indicators, anticipated states) of both affective valence and arousal are advocated for future studies.",doi,10.1046/j.1360-0443.2001.961116299.x,Scopus,Addiction,"Hills A.M., Hill S., Mamone N., Dickerson M.",2001,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,"Information Load Stress, Risk Taking, And Physiological Responsivity In A Visual‐Motor Task","The effects of four levels of information load on performance, risk taking, and physiological responsivity (blood pressure and heart rate) are investigated. Twenty‐five adults participated in a handeye coordination task, presented as a video game. Increases in load resulted in performance decrements and increased proclivity to take risks. Participation in the task increased (diastolic) arousal. Load effects on arousal were negligible. Subjects with greater diastolic blood pressure elevations engaged in more risk taking. The potential of two separate groupings of stressor effects, directly producing cognitive performance changes in one case and producing affective/arousal impacts in the other case (with potential indirect effects on cognition and performance), is considered.

,Integration Of Fire Simulation And Structural Analysis For Safety Evaluation Of Gymnasiums-With A Case Study Of Gymnasium For Olympic Games In 2008,"In order to be safely used in the 2008 Olympic Games, the currently existing gymnasiums should be taken for evaluating their safety of utilization. As the structural analysis and fire simulation have been developed to work separately in previous works, the normal loads and fire actions have not been able to be taken into account together. This paper presents a newly developed integrated system-SFSAS, for both of structural analysis and fire simulation. The computer model of a gymnasium can be used for both structural analysis and fire simulation in the system. Based on the structural analysis under temperature loads due to a fire that is designed according to the risk analysis, the fire protection degree for the components in a structure can be quantitated. In this paper, the solutions as well as a case study are presented and discussed in details. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

,Interactive Effects Of Anger Expression And Et-1 Lys198asn Polymorphism On Vasoconstriction Reactivity To Behavioral Stress,"Background: Ineffective anger expression has been associated with essential hypertension (EH) and with blood pressure (BP) reactivity to stress. The ET-1/Lys198Asn polymorphism has been associated with increased resting BP and exaggerated vasoconstrictive mediated BP reactivity. African Americans (AAs) are at particular risk for development of EH, report greater anger difficulties, and exhibit greater vasoconstrictive reactivity than their European American (EA) counterparts. Purpose: The objective is to investigate a gene-environment model of stress reactivity in which anger expression, particularly in combination with ET-1 T allele carrier status and AA ethnicity, would be associated with the greatest vasoconstrictive reactivity in response to a behavioral stressor. Methods: One hundred ninety-one AA and 197 EA normotensive young adults (M age = 18.8 ± 2.5 years) participated in the study. Total peripheral resistance index (TPRI) reactivity was assessed during a 10-min video game challenge. Anger expression was measured using Spielberger's Anger Expression Scale. Results: A multiple regression model with TPRI reactivity as the dependent variable revealed a three-way interaction effect for anger management (i.e., AM = anger control minus anger out scores), ethnicity, and ET-1 polymorphism. Specifically, AA carriers of the ET-1 polymorphism with poor AM skills exhibited the greatest TPRI reactivity. Conclusions: Individuals with a genetic predisposition for exaggerated vasoconstriction who also display low AM skills may be at particular risk for development of stress-induced EH. Such individuals may particularly benefit from anger management training. © 2005 by The Society of Behavioral Medicine.",doi,10.1207/s15324796abm3001_10,Scopus,Annals of Behavioral Medicine,"Rabineau K.M., Treiber F.A., Poole J., Ludwig D.",2005,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Interactive Video Game Cycling Leads To Higher Energy Expenditure And Is More Enjoyable Than Conventional Exercise In Adults,"Background: Despite the widely accepted health benefits of regular physical activity, only a small percentage of the population meets the current recommendations. The reasons include a wide use of technology and a lack of enjoyment while exercising. The purpose of this study was to compare the physiological, perceptual and enjoyment responses between a single bout of (I) conventional cycling and (II) interactive cycling video game at a matched workload. Methods: A cross-sectional study in 34 healthy participants was performed. Initially, participants completed an incremental maximal cycling test to measure peak oxygen uptake and to determine ventilatory threshold. In random order, participants carried out a 30 min interactive cycling trial and a 30 min conventional cycling trial at 55% of peak power output. During the trials, oxygen uptake and energy expenditure were measured by open-circuit spirometry and heart rate was measured by radiotelemetry. RPE and enjoyment were measured every 10 minutes with Borg scale and a modified PACES scale. Results: Interactive cycling resulted in a significantly greater %VO2Reserve (68.2% ± 9.2% vs 64.7% ± 8.1%), rate of energy expenditure (505.8±75.2 vs 487.4±81.2 j·kg-1·min-1), and enjoyment (63.4% ± 17 vs 42% ± 13.6), P<0.05. Participants were working at a higher intensity in relation to the individual's ventilatory threshold during the interactive cycling video game trial (M = 11.86, SE = 3.08) than during the Conventional cycling trial (M = 7.55, SE = 3.16, t(33) = -2.69, P<0.05, r =.42). No significant differences were found for heart rate reserve (72.5 ± 10.4 vs 71.4±10.1%) and RPE (13.1 ± 1.8 vs 13.2 ± 1.7). Conclusion: Interactive cycling games can be a valid alternative to conventional exercise as they result in a higher exercise intensity than conventional cycling and a distraction from aversive cognitive and physiological states at and above the ventilatory threshold. © 2015 Monedero et al.",doi,10.1371/journal.pone.0118470,Scopus,PLoS ONE,"Monedero J., Lyons E.J., O'Gorman D.J.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,"Interactive Virtual Reality Wii In Geriatric Day Hospital: A Study To Assess Its Feasibility, Acceptability And Efficacy","Aim: Rehabilitation using interactive virtual reality Wii (Wii-IVR) was shown to be feasible in patients with different medical problems, but there was no study examining its use in a geriatric day hospital (GDH). The aim of the present study was to test the feasibility, acceptability and efficacy of Wii-IVR in GDH. Methods: It was a clinical trial with matched historic controls. Patients of a GDH were recruited to participate in Wii-IVR by playing ""Wii Fit"". Participants used a Wii controller to carry out movements involved in an arm ergometer. Each participant received eight sessions of Wii-IVR in addition to conventional GDH rehabilitation. Feasibility was assessed by the total time receiving Wii-IVR, the percentage of maximal heart rate reserve (%MHR) and Borg perceived exertion scale (BS) after participating in Wii-IVR. %MHR and BS were compared with those after carrying out an arm ergometer for the same duration. Acceptability was assessed by an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Efficacy was assessed by comparing improvements in Functional Independence Measure (FIM) between participants and matched historic controls, who received conventional GDH rehabilitations only. Results: A total of 30 patients completed the study. Participants completed a total of 1941min of event-free Wii-IVR. The mean %MHR was 15.9%±9.9% and the mean BS was 7.9±2.3. There was no significant difference in %MHR and BS between participating in Wii-IVR and arm ergometer. Most participants found Wii-IVR similar to the arm ergometer, and would like to continue Wii-IVR if they had Wii at home. Improvements in FIM of participants were significantly more than that of historic controls. Conclusions: Wii-IVR in GDH was feasible and most participants accepted it. Participants had more improvements in FIM. © 2012 Japan Geriatrics Society.",doi,10.1111/j.1447-0594.2012.00848.x,Scopus,Geriatrics and Gerontology International,"Chan T.C., Chan F., Shea Y.F., Lin O.Y., Luk J.K.H., Chan F.H.W.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,"Internet Game Addiction, Depression, And Escape From Negative Emotions In Adulthood: A Nationwide Community Sample Of Korea","The aim of this study was to investigate the association between adult Internet game addiction (IGA) and mental disorders. A total of 1401 adults aged between 18 and 74 years participated in this study. The IGA group had significantly younger patients, and it showed a higher proportion of unmarried and unemployed adults, and higher rates of suicidal ideation, plan, and attempt than the non-IGA group. Multivariate logistic regression indicated that IGA was significantly associated with major depressive disorder, dysthymia, and depressive disorders adjusting for all variables. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score was significantly higher in the IGA group than in the non-IGA group for both young adults and middle groups. ""Escape from negative emotions like nervousness, sadness, and anger"" was the only significant item associated with depression among symptoms of IGA. This study suggests that adults with IGA and depression may use Internet games to escape from negative emotions. Copyright © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

,Investigating Students' Perceived Discipline Relevance Subsequent To Playing Educational Computer Games: A Personal Interest And Self-Determination Theory Approach,"The purpose of this study is to explain students' perceived relevance of playing an educational game as a means for development of discipline competence. Based on self-determination theory and the concept of personal interest, we propose that: Satisfying students' basic needs for competence, autonomy, and relatedness when playing educational games is critical for arousal of intrinsic motivation in learning-through-gaming; Students' interest in the core subject and their intrinsic motivation in learning-through-gaming are important for their perceptions of how relevant they believe the gaming session is for the discipline they are studying. The results from an empirical study indicate that arousal of intrinsic motivation in the ongoing gaming session is more important than pre-gaming interest in the core subject for participants' post-gaming perception of how relevant such gaming is as a means for developing their discipline competence. The results also indicate that satisfying basic needs for competence, autonomy, and relatedness is critical for arousal of intrinsic gaming motivation. Our findings have implications for the choice of pedagogical means when utilizing educational games as a complementary alternative to traditional learning methods. To that end, we offer directions for future research. © 2012 Copyright Scandinavian Journal of Educational Research.",doi,10.1080/00313831.2011.594609,Scopus,Scandinavian Journal of Educational Research,"Sørebø Ø., Hæhre R.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Is The Relationship Between Sedentary Behaviour And Cardiometabolic Health In Adolescents Independent Of Dietary Intake? A Systematic Review,"Screen time, but not overall sedentary behaviour, is consistently related to cardiometabolic health in adolescents. Because of the associations screen time has with dietary intake, diet may be an important factor in the screen time and health relationship; however, evidence has not previously been synthesized. Thus, the aim of this systematic review was to explore whether the associations between various sedentary behaviours and cardiometabolic risk markers are independent of dietary intake in adolescents. Online databases and personal libraries were searched for peer-reviewed original research articles published in English before March 2014. Included studies assessed associations between sedentary behaviour and cardiometabolic markers in 12- to 18-year-olds and adjusted for dietary intake. Twenty-five studies met the inclusion criteria. From the 21 studies examining sedentary behaviour and adiposity, the majority found significant positive associations between television viewing, screen time and self-reported overall sedentary behaviour with markers of adiposity, independent of dietary intake. No significant associations between screen time with blood pressure and cholesterol were reported. Sedentary behaviour appears to be associated with adiposity in adolescents, irrespective of dietary intake. However, the variability of dietary variables between studies suggests further work is needed to understand the role of dietary intake when examining these associations in youth. © 2015 World Obesity.",doi,10.1111/obr.12302,Scopus,Obesity Reviews,"Fletcher E., Leech R., Mcnaughton S.A., Dunstan D.W., Lacy K.E., Salmon J.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Keep Your Opponents Close: Social Context Affects Eeg And Femg Linkage In A Turn-Based Computer Game,"In daily life, we often copy the gestures and expressions of those we communicate with, but recent evidence shows that such mimicry has a physiological counterpart: interaction elicits linkage, which is a concordance between the biological signals of those involved. To find out how the type of social interaction affects linkage, pairs of participants played a turn-based computer game in which the level of competition was systematically varied between cooperation and competition. Linkage in the beta and gamma frequency bands was observed in the EEG, especially when the participants played directly against each other. Emotional expression, measured using facial EMG, reflected this pattern, with the most competitive condition showing enhanced linkage over the facial muscle-regions involved in smiling. These effects were found to be related to self-reported social presence: linkage in positive emotional expression was associated with self-reported shared negative feelings. The observed effects confirmed the hypothesis that the social context affected the degree to which participants had similar reactions to their environment and consequently showed similar patterns of brain activity. We discuss the functional resemblance between linkage, as an indicator of a shared physiology and affect, and the well-known mirror neuron system, and how they relate to social functions like empathy. © 2013 Spapé et al.",doi,10.1371/journal.pone.0078795,Scopus,PLoS ONE,"Spapé M.M., Kivikangas J.M., Järvelä S., Kosunen I., Jacucci G., Ravaja N.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Late Adolescents’ Experiences With And Attitudes Toward Videogames.,"A total of 229 late adolescents (a large majority 15 to 19 years of age) completed a questionnaire that assesses a broad range of videogame-relevant experiences, preferences, and attitudes. Videogame playing was found to be a more popular, and a more highly regarded, activity among males than females. Gender differences were also found in participants' ratings of their motivations for playing videogames, their evaluations of particular characteristics of videogames, and their selection of their “most favorite” videogame. The differences between frequent and infrequent videogame players appeared to be limited to differences in the extent to which videogame playing is pursued and evaluated as a positive leisure activity, rather than reflecting broad differences in interest or personality. Some relations were found between participants' self-reported personality characteristics (i.e., self-esteem, empathy, conscientiousness, and introversion) and their attitudes toward videogames.",doi,10.1111/j.1559-1816.1997.tb01808.x,anderson2010,Journal of Applied Social Psychology,"Barnett, M.

,Learning Dynamics In Social Dilemmas,"The Nash equilibrium, the main solution concept in analytical game theory, cannot make precise predictions about the outcome of repeated mixed-motive games. Nor can it tell us much about the dynamics by which a population of players moves from one equilibrium to another. These limitations, along with concerns about the cognitive demands of forward-looking rationality, have motivated efforts to explore backward-looking alternatives to analytical game theory. Most of the effort has been invested in evolutionary models of population dynamics. We shift attention to a learning-theoretic alternative. Computational experiments with adaptive agents identify a fundamental solution concept for social dilemmas-stochastic collusion-based on a random walk from a self-limiting noncooperative equilibrium into a self-reinforcing cooperative equilibrium. However, we show that this solution is viable only within a narrow range of aspiration levels. Below the lower threshold, agents are pulled into a deficient equilibrium that is a stronger attractor than mutual cooperation. Above the upper threshold, agents are dissatisfied with mutual cooperation. Aspirations that adapt with experience (producing habituation to stimuli) do not gravitate into the window of viability; rather, they are the worst of both worlds. Habituation destabilizes cooperation and stabilizes defection. Results from the two-person problem suggest that applications to multiplex and embedded relationships will yield unexpected insights into the global dynamics of cooperation in social dilemmas.",doi,10.1073/pnas.092080099,Scopus,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,"Macy M.W., Flache A.",2002,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas

,"Living Emotions, Avoiding Emotions: Behavioral Investigation Of The Regulation Of Socially Driven Emotions","Emotion regulation is important for psychological well-being. Although it is known that alternative regulation strategies may have different emotional consequences, the effectiveness of such strategies for socially driven emotions remains unclear. In this study we investigated the efficacy of different forms of reappraisal on responses to the selfish and altruistic behavior of others in the Dictator Game. In Experiment 1, subjects mentalized the intentions of the other player in one condition, and took distance from the situation in the other. Emotion ratings were recorded after each offer. Compared with a baseline condition, mentalizing led subjects to experience their emotions more positively when receiving both selfish and altruistic proposals, whereas distancing decreased the valence when receiving altruistic offers, but did not affect the perception of selfish behavior. In Experiment 2, subjects played with both computer and human partners while reappraising the meaning of the player's intentions (with a human partner) or the meaning of the situation (with a computer partner). Results showed that both contexts were effectively modulated by reappraisal, however a stronger effect was observed when the donor was a human partner, as compared to a computer partner. Taken together, these results demonstrate that socially driven emotions can be successfully modulated by reappraisal strategies that focus on the reinterpretation of others' intentions. © 2013 Grecucci, Giorgetta, Bonini and Sanfey.",doi,10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00616,Scopus,Frontiers in Psychology,"Grecucci A., Giorgetta C., Bonini N., Sanfey A.G.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Longitudinal Effects Of Violent Video Games Aggression In Japan And The United States.,"CONTEXT. Youth worldwide play violent video games many hours per week. Previous research suggests that such exposure can increase physical aggression.OBJECTIVE. We tested whether high exposure to violent video games increases physical aggression over time in both high- (United States) and low- (Japan) violence cultures. We hypothesized that the amount of exposure to violent video games early in a school year would predict changes in physical aggressiveness assessed later in the school year, even after statistically controlling for gender and previous physical aggressiveness. DESIGN. In 3 independent samples, participants’ video game habits and physically aggressive behavior tendencies were assessed at 2 points in time, separated by 3 to 6 months.PARTICIPANTS. One sample consisted of 181 Japanese junior high students ranging in age from 12 to 15 years. A second Japanese sample consisted of 1050 students ranging in age from 13 to 18 years. The third sample consisted of 364 United States 3rd-, 4th-, and 5th-graders ranging in age from 9 to 12 years. RESULTS. Habitual violent video game play early in the school year predicted later aggression, even after controlling for gender and previous aggressiveness in each sample. Those who played a lot of violent video games became relatively more physically aggressive. Multisample structure equation modeling revealed that this longitudinal effect was of a similar magnitude in the United States and Japan for similar-aged youth and was smaller (but still significant) in the sample that included older youth.CONCLUSIONS. These longitudinal results confirm earlier experimental and cross-sectional studies that had suggested that playing violent video games is a significant risk factor for later physically aggressive behavior and that this violent video game effect on youth generalizes across very different cultures. As a whole, the research strongly suggests reducing the exposure of youth to this risk factor.",doi,10.1542/peds.2008-1425,anderson2010,Pediatrics,"Anderson, C. A., Sakamoto, A., Gentile, D.

,"Media And Stress In Adolescent Boys In Germany. Journal Of Children And Media, 4(1), 18–38.","The study is on the effects of entertainment media on physiological and psychological indicators of stress. The concept of stress is considered to play a key role in the explanation of the effects of media use on aggression, academic performance, and health. Two types of media (television and video games) and violent versus nonviolent content were compared. Differential effects on physiological measures (heart rate [HR], heart rate variability [HRV], cortisol, salivary alpha-amylase [sAA]) and subjective experience were expected. Study participants consisted of 98 boys, aged 11 to 14. Physiological stress reactions were higher for video games than for television with regards to HR and HRV. Violent content had greater effects on physiological stress than nonviolent content, when measured in terms of sAA, cortisol, and HRV. Violent content, in general, was rated as being more stressful but also more enjoyable. The results underline that certain types of media use are associated with subjective and physiological indices of stress.",doi,10.1080/17482790903407259,nagy2015,Journal of Children and Media,"Maass, A., Lohaus, A., Wolf, O.

,Media Violence And Youth Violence: A 2-Year Longitudinal Study.,"The frequency of exposure to media violence and eight additional risk factors were path-analyzed in a 2-year longitudinal study. The exposure to media violence (total score) affected students’ later violence (β = .28) and later violent delinquency (β = .30) more strongly than other risk factors. Direct effects were also caused by risk factors assessed at Time 1, which in turn were reinforced by the remaining risk factors on the second or third stratum of analysis. Of particular importance are the findings that (1) playing violent electronic games is the strongest risk factor of violent criminality and (2) both media-stimulated and real experiences of aggressive emotions associated with the motive of revenge are core risk factors of violence in school and violent criminality. The results of our study show that the more frequently children view horror and violence films during childhood and the more frequently they play violent electronic games at the beginning of adolescence the higher will these students’ violence and delinquency be at the age of 14.",doi,10.1027/1864-1105.20.3.79,anderson2010,Journal of Media Psychology,"Hoph, W.

,"Mediators And Moderators Of Long-Term Effects Of Violent Video Games On Aggressive Behavior Practice, Thinking, And Action","IMPORTANCE Although several longitudinal studies have demonstrated an effect of violent video game play on later aggressive behavior, little is known about the psychological mediators and moderators of the effect. OBJECTIVE To determine whether cognitive and/or emotional variables mediate the effect of violent video game play on aggression and whether the effect is moderated by age, sex, prior aggressiveness, or parental monitoring. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Three-year longitudinal panel study. A total of 3034 children and adolescents from 6 primary and 6 secondary schools in Singapore (73%male) were surveyed annually. Children were eligible for inclusion if they attended one of the 12 selected schools, 3 of which were boys' schools. At the beginning of the study, participants were in third, fourth, seventh, and eighth grades, with a mean (SD) age of 11.2 (2.1) years (range, 8-17 years). Study participation was 99% in year 1. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The final outcome measurewas aggressive behavior, with aggressive cognitions (normative beliefs about aggression, hostile attribution bias, aggressive fantasizing) and empathy as potential mediators. RESULTS Longitudinal latent growth curve modeling demonstrated that the effects of violent video game play are mediated primarily by aggressive cognitions. This effect is not moderated by sex, prior aggressiveness, or parental monitoring and is only slightly moderated by age, as younger children had a larger increase in initial aggressive cognition related to initial violent game play at the beginning of the study than older children. Model fit was excellent for all models. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Given that more than 90% of youths play video games, understanding the psychological mechanisms by which they can influence behaviors is important for parents and pediatricians and for designing interventions to enhance or mitigate the effects. © 2014 American Medical Association.",doi,10.1001/jamapediatrics.2014.63,Scopus,JAMA Pediatrics,"Gentile D.A., Li D., Khoo A., Prot S., Anderson C.A.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Mental Fatigue: Impairment Of Technical Performance In Small-Sided Soccer Games,"Purpose: To assess the effects of mental fatigue on physical and technical performance in small-sided soccer games. Methods: Twenty soccer players (age 17.8 ± 1.0 y, height 179 ± 5 cm, body mass 72.4 ± 6.8 kg, playing experience 8.3 ± 1.4 y) from an Australian National Premier League soccer club volunteered to participate in this randomized crossover investigation. Participants played 15-min 5-vs-5 small-sided games (SSGs) without goalkeepers on 2 occasions separated by 1 wk. Before the SSG, 1 team watched a 30-min emotionally neutral documentary (control), while the other performed 30 min of a computer-based Stroop task (mental fatigue). Subjective ratings of mental and physical fatigue were recorded before and after treatment and after the SSG. Motivation was assessed before treatment and SSG; mental effort was assessed after treatment and SSG. Player activity profiles and heart rate (HR) were measured throughout the SSG, whereas ratings of perceived exertion (RPEs) were recorded before the SSG and immediately after each half. Video recordings of the SSG allowed for notational analysis of technical variables. Results: Subjective ratings of mental fatigue and effort were higher after the Stroop task, whereas motivation for the upcoming SSG was similar between conditions. HR during the SSG was possibly higher in the control condition, whereas RPE was likely higher in the mental-fatigue condition. Mental fatigue had an unclear effect on most physical-performance variables but impaired most technical-performance variables. Conclusions: Mental fatigue impairs technical but not physical performance in small-sided soccer games. © 2016 Human Kinetics, Inc.",doi,10.1123/ijspp.2015-0710,Scopus,International Journal of Sports Physiology and Performance,"Badin O.O., Smith M.R., Conte D., Coutts A.J.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Methodology Of Affective Intervention Design For Intelligent Systems,"This paper concerns how intelligent systems should be designed to make adequate, valuable and natural affective interventions. The article proposes a process for choosing an affective intervention model for an intelligent system. The process consists of 10 activities that allow for step-by-step design of an affective feedback loop and takes into account the following factors: expected and desired emotional states, characteristics of the system and available input channels for emotion recognition. The proposed method is supported with three examples of intelligent systems that have used the process to design or to describe affective intervention. Two of them are case studies of affective video games that were designed with the proposed approach and evaluated against the non-affective versions. Another example described in the article is the affective tutoring system Gerda, which exemplifies a more complex and sophisticated intervention model. © 2016 The Author 2016.

,Minecraft And The Building Blocks Of Creative Individuality,"This article situates the video game Minecraft along with Robinson Crusoe in a genealogy of island fictions to show how Minecraft reinterprets narratives of creative subjects and invention. By reading Minecraft through histories of construction toys, modern conceptions of creativity, and digital practices of modding, I argue that Minecraft allows players to experiment with various social and environmental conditions historically central to debates over shaping creative subjects, rooted in island narratives as the generic site for negotiating conflicts between individual autonomy and social dependence. I show how Minecraft players become inventive subjects through simulating Crusoe’s island and performing code work with the game as software embedded in networks of players, programmers, and digital technologies. © 2016 by Johns Hopkins University Press and the Society for Literature, Science, and the Arts.",doi,10.1353/con.2016.0030,Scopus,Configurations,Nguyen J.,2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Mocalc: A New Graphical User Interface For Molecular Calculations,"A new computer program called MoCalc (Molecular Calculations) has been designed to help the computational chemistry practitioner in the task of performing and analyzing molecular calculations. MoCalc is a graphical user interface for the MO calculation programs Gamess and Mopac, and uses Rasmol and Babel for molecule display and file conversion, respectively. In its initial version, MoCalc can execute the following operations: (a) create and handle Gamess and Mopac input files; (b) import any kind of molecular geometry supported by Babel and paste it as Cartesian, internal, or Gaussian-type coordinates on the input file; (c) convert Gamess and Mopac output files to inputs of both programs; (d) edit and validate the keywords that control the Gamess and Mopac calculation procedure; (e) display the input (Mopac) and output (Gamess and Mopac) molecular geometries; (f) run single or multiple (batch) calculations, either interactively or in background; (g) automatically open the output files as soon as the calculation finishes; (h) extract results from the output files, such as energy, charges, dipole, population analysis, wave function, bond orders, and valence analysis, and display them in spreadsheets; (i) calculate reactivity indices derived from the frontier orbital theory and the root-mean-square (rms) deviation of input and output geometries. All the results generated by MoCalc can be promptly transferred to text editors and electronic spreadsheets, which facilitate a detailed subsequent analysis and the publication of the results. MoCalc can also perform graphical and numerical comparative analysis of the some results when more than one output file is loaded.

,Modeling And Simulation Of Pedestrian Behaviors In Crowded Places,"Pedestrian simulation has many applications in computer games, military simulations, and animation systems. A realistic pedestrian simulation requires a realistic pedestrian behavioral model that takes into account the various behavioral aspects of a real pedestrian. In this article, we describe our work on such a model, which aims to generate human-like pedestrian behaviors. To this end, various important factors in a real-pedestrian's decision-making process are considered in our model. These factors include a pedestrian's sensory attention, memory, and navigational behaviors. In particular, a two-level navigation model is proposed to generate realistic navigational behavior. As a result, our pedestrian model is able to generate various realistic behaviors such as overtaking, waiting, side-stepping and lane-forming in a crowded area. The simulated pedestrians are also able to navigate through complex environment, given an abstract map of the environment. © 2011 ACM.",doi,10.1145/1921598.1921604,Scopus,ACM Transactions on Modeling and Computer Simulation,"Koh W.L., Zhou S.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Modeling Believable Agents Using A Descriptive Approach,"The concept of believable agents in game and simulator design has become increasingly important. This is because the improved realism offered by synthetic agents can lead to the increased popularity and prolonged life of electronic games. This paper offers a model for the development of believable agents. Specifically, this paper proposes the use of a descriptive approach to agent design. Using this approach, in-game agents are designed to learn human emotional responses from real world data. To achieve this, training data was collected and fed to the descriptive learning believable agent model. Further, we conducted a comparative study to determine whether agents designed using this approach were more believable than agents designed using more traditional approaches. The findings from this study revealed that the descriptive learning agent was perceived by study participants to be more believable than the agent that was programmed according to the specifications of two third-party agent developers. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",doi,10.1016/j.bica.2015.09.004,Scopus,Biologically Inspired Cognitive Architectures,"Harris T., Gittens C.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Modulation Of Attentional Inhibition By Norepinephrine And Cortisol After Psychological Stress,"Two of the most salient physiological responses to stress are increased norepinephrine (NE) and cortisol (CORT) activities. However, it is unclear how these neurochemical events affect cognition, especially attention. We examined the effects of mild psychological stress on selective attention, as assessed by the negative priming (NP) paradigm. Salivary measures of the stress hormone CORT and α-amylase (a correlate of NE) were assayed to probe the relationship between the stress response and attentional inhibition. Healthy subjects (N=20) engaged in the attention task, which was then followed by 15 min of a stressful video game before a return to the attentional task. Baseline saliva samples were obtained before the experiment began, 1 min after the video-game stressor, and 20 min post-stress. Subjects showed a significant reduction in NP and a decrease in reaction time (RT) after the video game. Moreover, α-amylase levels increased significantly after the stressor, indicating the role of NE in the acute stress response. While CORT levels remained unchanged after stress, CORT correlated significantly with both NP scores and RT after the stressor. These results imply that mild psychological stress can significantly alter attentional processes. Given the increase in α-amylase and the correlation between attention and CORT after stress, it seems likely that attentional processes are under tight control by brain systems which mediate the fight-or-flight response.

,Motion Adaptive Patch-Based Low-Rank Approach For Compressed Sensing Cardiac Cine Mri,"One of the technical challenges in cine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is to reduce the acquisition time to enable the high spatio-temporal resolution imaging of a cardiac volume within a short scan time. Recently, compressed sensing approaches have been investigated extensively for highly accelerated cine MRI by exploiting transform domain sparsity using linear transforms such as wavelets, and Fourier. However, in cardiac cine imaging, the cardiac volume changes significantly between frames, and there often exist abrupt pixel value changes along time. In order to effectively sparsify such temporal variations, it is necessary to exploit temporal redundancy along motion trajectories. This paper introduces a novel patch-based reconstruction method to exploit geometric similarities in the spatio-temporal domain. In particular, we use a low rank constraint for similar patches along motion, based on the observation that rank structures are relatively less sensitive to global intensity changes, but make it easier to capture moving edges. A Nash equilibrium formulation with relaxation is employed to guarantee convergence. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm clearly reconstructs important anatomical structures in cardiac cine image and provides improved image quality compared to existing state-of-the-art methods such as k-t FOCUSS, k-t SLR, and MASTeR. © 1982-2012 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TMI.2014.2330426,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,"Yoon H., Kim K.S., Kim D., Bresler Y., Ye J.C.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Multimodal Affect Modeling And Recognition For Empathic Robot Companions,"Affect recognition for socially perceptive robots relies on representative data. While many of the existing affective corpora and databases contain posed and decontextualized affective expressions, affect resources for designing an affect recognition system in naturalistic human-robot interaction (HRI) must include context-rich expressions that emerge in the same scenario of the final application. In this paper, we propose a context-based approach to the collection and modeling of representative data for building an affect-sensitive robotic game companion. To illustrate our approach we present the key features of the Inter-ACT (INTEracting with Robots-Affect Context Task) corpus, an affective and contextually rich multimodal video corpus containing affective expressions of children playing chess with an iCat robot. We show how this corpus can be successfully used to train a context-sensitive affect recognition system (a valence detector) for a robotic game companion. Finally, we demonstrate how the integration of the affect recognition system in a modular platform for adaptive HRI makes the interaction with the robot more engaging. © 2013 World Scientific Publishing Company.",doi,10.1142/S0219843613500102,Scopus,International Journal of Humanoid Robotics,"Castellano G., Leite I., Pereira A., Martinho C., Paiva A., McOwan P.W.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Multimodal Ptsd Characterization Via The Startlemart Game,"Computer games have recently shown promise as a diagnostic and treatment tool for psychiatric rehabilitation. This paper examines the potential of combining multiple modalities for detecting affective responses of patients interacting with a simulation built on game technology, aimed at the treatment of mental diagnoses such as post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). For that purpose, we couple game design and game technology to create a game-based tool for exposure therapy and stress inoculation training that utilizes stress detection for the automatic profiling and potential personalization of PTSD treatments. The PTSD treatment game we designed forces the player to go through various stressful experiences while a stress detection mechanism profiles the severity and type of PTSD by analyzing the physiological responses to those in-game stress elicitors in two separate modalities: skin conductance (SC) and blood volume pulse (BVP). SC is often used to monitor stress as it is connected to the activation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). By including BVP into the model we introduce information about para-sympathetic activation, which offers a more complete view of the psycho-physiological experience of the player; in addition, as BVP is also modulated by SNS, a multimodal model should be more robust to changes in each modality due to particular drugs or day-to-day bodily changes. Overall, the study and analysis of 14 PTSD-diagnosed veteran soldiers presented in this paper reveals correspondence between diagnostic standard measures of PTSD severity and SC and BVP responsiveness and feature combinations thereof. The study also reveals that these features are significantly correlated with subjective evaluations of the stressfulness of experiences, represented as pairwise preferences. More importantly, the results presented here demonstrate that using the modalities of SC and BVP captures a more nuanced representation of player stress responses than using SC alone. We conclude that the results support the use of the simulation as a relevant treatment tool for stress inoculation training, and suggest the feasibility of using such a tool to profile PTSD patients. The use of multiple modalities appears to be key for an accurate profiling, although further research and analysis are required to identify the most relevant physiological features for capturing user stress. © 2014, OpenInterface Association.",doi,10.1007/s12193-014-0160-5,Scopus,Journal on Multimodal User Interfaces,"Holmgård C., Yannakakis G.N., Martínez H.P., Karstoft K.-I., Andersen H.S.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Multiplayer Reach-Avoid Games Via Pairwise Outcomes,"A multiplayer reach-avoid game is a differential game between an attacking team with NA attackers and a defending team with ND defenders playing on a compact domain with obstacles. The attacking team aims to send M of the NA attackers to some target location, while the defending team aims to prevent that by capturing attackers or indefinitely delaying attackers from reaching the target. Although the analysis of this game plays an important role in many applications, the optimal solution to this game is computationally intractable when NA &gt; 1 or ND &gt; 1. In this technical note, we present two approaches for the NA=ND=1 case to determine pairwise outcomes, and a graph theoretic maximum matching approach to merge these pairwise outcomes for an NA,ND &gt; 1 solution that provides guarantees on the performance of the defending team. We will show that the four-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs approach allows for real-time updates to the maximum matching, and that the two-dimensional ""path defense"" approach is considerably more scalable with the number of players while maintaining defender performance guarantees. © 2016 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TAC.2016.2577619,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,"Chen M., Zhou Z., Tomlin C.J.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Negativity Bias In Attitude Learning: A Possible Indicator Of Vulnerability To Emotional Disorders?,"Negativity biases, i.e., tendencies for negative features and interpretations to predominate over positive, are known to play a role in the etiology and maintenance of emotional disorders. Both depression and anxiety have been associated with such negative cognitive styles. Recently, Fazio, R.H., Eiser, J.R., and Shook, N.J. [(2004). Attitude formation through exploration: Valence asymmetries. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 87, 293-311] have observed similar valence asymmetries in the domain of attitude formation and generalization. The present research examined the possibility that the extent to which individuals display a learning bias in attitude formation is related to negative cognitive style and emotional disorder symptoms. Participants played a computer game that required learning whether novel stimuli produced positive or negative outcomes. Poorer learning was associated with more negative cognitive style, greater depression, and a tendency toward greater anxiety. Interestingly, these relations were most evident with respect to the learning of the positive stimuli, suggesting that an under-appreciation of positive objects and events may underlie vulnerability to emotional disorders. The potential value of various indices of negativity bias that can be assessed when examining attitude formation and generalization is discussed. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

,Negotiating Uneven Terrain With A Compliant Designed Unmanned Ground Vehicle Equipped With Locomotive Master-Slave Operation,"In recent years, a number operational unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) have been developed that can negotiate irregular terrain. They have a number of degrees-of-freedom (DOF) giving them enhanced mobility, e.g., the ability to climb stairs and over obstacles. However, operating them remotely is complicated because their controllers are similar to conventional control pads or joysticks used in computer games or toys. It is hard for the operator to achieve an intuitive and natural feel, thus mistakes are common. To intuitively control the locomotion of a UGV with many DOFs, a master-slave operation was implemented. A novel UGV called Kurogane, which consists of a typical crawler combined with a human-like torso section, was developed. The torso section is controlled via a wearable controller interface. In addition, the UGV is equipped with models of muscle viscoelasticity and stretch reflex, called the involuntary autonomous adaptation system, inspired by the adaptive compliance of animals. The proposed system can autonomously and flexibly react and adapt to irregular terrain in real time. Therefore, the operation of Kurogane is simple and does not require great skill or precision. Experimental results show that it performs well over a fixed step, stairs, and rough outdoor terrain. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",doi,10.1002/rob.21449,Scopus,Journal of Field Robotics,"Fukuoka Y., Hoshi K., Kurosawa R.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Neural Basis Of Emotional Decision Making In Trait Anxiety,"Although trait anxiety has been associated with risk decision making, whether it is related to risk per se or to the feeling of the risk, as well as the underlying neurocognitive mechanisms, remains unclear. Using a decision-making task with a manipulation of frame (i.e., written description of options as a potential gain or loss) and functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated the neurocognitive relationship between trait anxiety and decision making. The classic framing effect was observed: participants chose the safe option when it was described as a potential gain, but they avoided the same option when it was described as a potential loss. Most importantly, trait anxiety was positively correlated with this behavioral bias. Trait anxiety was also positively correlated with amygdala-based ""emotional"" system activation and its coupling with the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) when decisions were consistent with the framing effect, but negatively correlated with the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC)-based ""analytic"" system activation and its connectivity to the vmPFC when decisions ran counter to the framing effect. Our findings suggest that trait anxiety is not associated with subjective risk preference but an evaluative bias of emotional information in decision making, underpinned by a hyperactive emotional system and a hypoactive analytic system in the brain. ©2013 the authors.",doi,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1253-13.2013,Scopus,Journal of Neuroscience,"Xu P., Gu R., Broster L.S., Wu R., Van Dam N.T., Jiang Y., Fan J., Luo Y.-J.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Neural Correlates Of Wishful Thinking,"Wishful thinking (WT) implies the overestimation of the likelihood of desirable events. It occurs for outcomes of personal interest, but also for events of interest to others we like. We investigated whether WT is grounded on low-level selective attention or on higher level cognitive processes including differential weighting of evidence or response formation. Participants in our MRI study predicted the likelihood that their favorite or least favorite team would win a football game. Consistent with expectations, favorite team trials were characterized by higher winning odds. Our data demonstrated activity in a cluster comprising parts of the left inferior occipital and fusiform gyri to distinguish between favorite and least favorite team trials. More importantly, functional connectivities of this cluster with the human reward system were specifically involved in the type of WT investigated in our study, thus supporting the idea of an attention bias generating WT. Prefrontal cortex activity also distinguished between the two teams. However, activity in this region and its functional connectivities with the human reward system were altogether unrelated to the degree of WT reflected in the participants' behavior and may rather be related to social identification, ensuring the affective context necessary for WT to arise. © The Author (2011).

,Neural Mechanisms Of Social Decision-Making In The Primate Amygdala,"Social decisions require evaluation of costs and benefits to oneself and others. Long associated with emotion and vigilance, the amygdala has recently been implicated in both decision-making and social behavior. The amygdala signals reward and punishment, as well as facial expressions and the gaze of others. Amygdala damage impairs social interactions, and the social neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) influences human social decisions, in part, by altering amygdala function. Here we show inmonkeys playing amodified dictator game, inwhich one individual can donate or withhold rewards from another, that basolateral amygdala (BLA) neurons signaled social preferences both across trials and across days. BLA neurons mirrored the value of rewards delivered to self and others when monkeys were free to choose but not when the computer made choices for them. We also found that focal infusion of OT unilaterally into BLA weakly but significantly increased both the frequency of prosocial decisions and attention to recipients for context-specific prosocial decisions, endorsing the hypothesis that OT regulates social behavior, in part, via amygdala neuromodulation. Our findings demonstrate both neurophysiological and neuroendocrinological connections between primate amygdala and social decisions.",doi,10.1073/pnas.1514761112,Scopus,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,"Chang S.W.C., Fagan N.A., Toda K., Utevsky A.V., Pearson J.M., Platt M.L., Gazzaniga M.S.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Neural Responses To Unfairness And Fairness Depend On Self-Contribution To The Income,"Self-contribution to the income (individual achievement) was an important factor which needs to be taken into individual's fairness considerations. This study aimed at elucidating the modulation of self-contribution to the income, on recipient's responses to unfairness in the Ultimatum Game. Eighteen participants were scanned while they were playing an adapted version of the Ultimatum Game as responders. Before splitting money, the proposer and the participant (responder) played the ball-guessing game. The responder's contribution to the income was manipulated by both the participant's and the proposer's accuracy in the ball-guessing game. It turned out that the participants more often rejected unfair offers and gave lower fairness ratings when they played a more important part in the earnings. At the neural level, anterior insula, anterior cingulate cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and temporoparietal junction showed greater activities to unfairness when self-contribution increased, whereas ventral striatum and medial orbitofrontal gyrus showed higher activations to fair (vs unfair) offers in the other-contributed condition relative to the other two. Besides, the activations of right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during unfair offers showed positive correlation with rejection rates in the self-contributed condition. These findings shed light on the significance of self-contribution in fairness-related social decision-making processes. © The Author (2013).

,Neural Strategies For Selective Attention Distinguish Fast-Action Video Game Players,"We investigated the psychophysical and neurophysiological differences between fast-action video game players (specifically first person shooter players, FPS) and non-action players (role-playing game players, RPG) in a visual search task. We measured both successful detections (hit rates) and steady-state visually evoked EEG potentials (SSVEPs). Search difficulty was varied along two dimensions: number of adjacent attended and ignored regions (1, 2 and 4), and presentation rate of novel search arrays (3, 8.6 and 20 Hz). Hit rates decreased with increasing presentation rates and number of regions, with the FPS players performing on average better than the RPG players. The largest differences in hit rate, between groups, occurred when four regions were simultaneously attended. We computed signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of SSVEPs and used partial least squares regression to model hit rates, SNRs and their relationship at 3 Hz and 8.6 Hz. The following are the most significant results: RPG players' parietal responses to the attended 8.6 Hz flicker were predictive of hit rate and were positively correlated with it, indicating attentional signal enhancement. FPS players' parietal responses to the ignored 3 Hz flicker were predictive of hit rate and were positively correlated with it, indicating distractor suppression. Consistent with these parietal responses, RPG players' frontal responses to the attended 8.6 Hz flicker, increased as task difficulty increased with number of regions; FPS players' frontal responses to the ignored 3 Hz flicker increased with number of regions. Thus the FPS players appear to employ an active suppression mechanism to deploy selective attention simultaneously to multiple interleaved regions, while RPG primarily use signal enhancement. These results suggest that fast-action gaming can affect neural strategies and the corresponding networks underlying attention, presumably by training mechanisms of distractor suppression. © 2012 The Author(s).",doi,10.1007/s10548-012-0232-3,Scopus,Brain Topography,"Krishnan L., Kang A., Sperling G., Srinivasan R.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Non-Linear Dynamical System Approach To Behavior Modeling,"We present a dynamic systems approach to modeling and generating low-level behaviors for autonomous agents. Such behaviors include real-time target tracking and obstacle avoidance in time-varying environments. The novelty of the method lies on the integration of distinct non-linear dynamic systems to model the agent's interaction with the environment. An angular velocity control dynamic system guides the agent's direction angle, while another dynamic system selects the environmental input that will be used in the control system. The agent interacts with the environment through its knowledge of the position of stationary and moving objects. In our system agents automatically avoid stationary and moving obstacles to reach the desired target(s). This approach allows us to prove the stability conditions that result in a principled methodology for the computation of the system's dynamic parameters. We present a variety of real-time simulations that illustrate the power of our approach.",doi,10.1007/s003710050184,Scopus,Visual Computer,"Goldenstein S., Large E., Metaxas D.",1999,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas

These devices provided a simple single-layer set-up to control of a large number of random elements in a simultaneous and individual manner. The generation of visual and physical artificial impressions of a surface was demonstrated using an imaging array system, called 'artificial skin'. The artificial skin was used for physical-auditory interaction with simulators and game engines by mapping computer-generated data.

,Oscillatory Activity And Phase-Amplitude Coupling In The Human Medial Frontal Cortex During Decision Making,"Electroencephalogram oscillations recorded both within and over the medial frontal cortex have been linked to a range of cognitive functions, including positive and negative feedback processing. Medial frontal oscillatory characteristics during decision making remain largely unknown. Here, we examined oscillatory activity of the human medial frontal cortex recorded while subjects played a competitive decision-making game. Distinct patterns of power and cross-trial phase coherence in multiple frequency bands were observed during different decision-related processes (e.g., feedback anticipation vs. feedback processing). Decision and feedback processing were accompanied by a broadband increase in cross-trial phase coherence at around 220 msec, and dynamic fluctuations in power. Feedback anticipation was accompanied by a shift in the power spectrum from relatively lower (delta and theta) to higher (alpha and beta) power. Power and cross-trial phase coherence were greater following losses compared to wins in theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands, but were greater following wins compared to losses in the delta band. Finally, we found that oscillation power in alpha and beta frequency bands were synchronized with the phase of delta and theta oscillations (''phase-amplitude coupling''). This synchronization differed between losses and wins, suggesting that phase-amplitude coupling might reflect a mechanism of feedback valence coding in the medial frontal cortex. Our findings link medial frontal oscillations to decision making, with relations among activity in different frequency bands suggesting a phase-utilizing coding of feedback valence information. ©2008 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",doi,10.1162/jocn.2008.21020,Scopus,Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience,"Cohen M.X., Elger C.E., Fell J.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Overview Of E-Bug: An Antibiotic And Hygiene Educational Resource For Schools,"Antibiotic resistance is an increasing community problem and is related to antibiotic use. If antibiotic use could be reduced, the tide of increasing resistance could be stemmed. e-Bug is a European project involving 18 European countries, partly funded by The Directorate-General for Health and Consumers (DG SANCO) of the European Commission. It aims to develop and disseminate across Europe a junior and senior school teaching pack and web site (hosting the lesson plans and complementary games) that teach young people about prudent antibiotic use, microbes, transmission of infection, hygiene and vaccines. The aim of e-Bug is to increase young people's understanding, through enjoyable activities, of why it is so important to use antibiotics correctly in order to control antibiotic resistance, and to have good hand and respiratory hygiene to help reduce the spread of infection. Within the senior school pack the sexual transmission of infections has also been included, as the peak age of chlamydial infection is in 16-24 year olds. Teachers, young people and the consortium of 18 countries were closely involved with agreeing learning outcomes and developing the resource activities. Young people helped create the characters and microbe artwork. The resources have been translated, adapted for and disseminated to schools across 10 countries in Europe, and endorsed by the relevant government departments of health and education. The web site has been accessed from >200 countries. The resources will be translated into all European Union languages, and have been used to promote European Antibiotic Awareness Day and better hand and respiratory hygiene during the influenza pandemic in 2009. © The Author 2011.

,Performance Of Non-Cooperative Routing Over Parallel Non-Observable Queues,"Autonomic computing is emerging as a significant new approach to the design of computer services. Its goal is the development of services that are able to manage themselves with minimal direct human intervention, and, in particular, are able to sense their environment and to tune themselves to meet end-user needs. However, the impact on performance of the interaction between multiple uncoordinated self-optimizing services is not yet well understood. We present some recent results on a non-cooperative load-balancing game which help to better understand the result of this interaction. In this game, users generate jobs of different services, and the jobs have to be processed on one of the servers of a computing platform. Each service has its own dispatcher which probabilistically routes jobs to servers so as to minimize the mean processing cost of its own jobs. We first investigate the impact of heterogeneity in the amount of incoming traffic routed by dispatchers and present a result stating that, for a fixed amount of total incoming traffic, the worst-case overall performance occurs when each dispatcher routes the same amount of traffic. Using this result we then study the so-called Price of Anarchy (PoA), an oft-used worst-case measure of the inefficiency of non-cooperative decentralized architectures. We give explicit bounds on the PoA for cost functions representing the mean delay of jobs when the service discipline is PS or SRPT. These bounds indicate that significant performance degradations can result from the selfish behavior of self-optimizing services. In practice, though, the worst-case scenario may occur rarely, if at all. Some recent results suggest that for the game under consideration the PoA is an overly pessimistic measure that does not reflect the performance obtained in most instances of the problem. © Cambridge University Press 2016.",doi,10.1017/S0269964816000097,Scopus,Probability in the Engineering and Informational Sciences,Brun O.,2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Peter Ueberroth's Legacy: How The 1984 Los Angeles Olympics Changed The Trajectory Of The Olympic Movement,"Interest in staging the Olympic Games waned in cities across the world in the 1970s, given the intrusion of world geo-politics on recent festivals and the exploding costs of staging them. In running the show in Los Angeles, Peter Ueberroth prioritised pre-existing facilities, a new and more profitable means of affiliating corporate sponsors with an organising committee, and maximising revenue from television rights negotiations. His success encouraged cities to re-enter the bidding for Olympic festivals, and when combined with initiatives launched by the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) President, Juan Antonio Samaranch, brighter days for the IOC lay ahead in the 1980s and 1990s. Yet, Ueberroth's legacy was not well managed ultimately by Samaranch, who permitted the enhanced competition among bid cities, and the behaviour of bid officials and some of his own members to endanger the IOC's reputation and autonomy, highlighted notably by the Salt Lake City scandal. Last, in light of the cost of the Olympic festivals in Beijing and Sochi, and its dampening effect on the current host city bidding environment, it seems wise for the IOC and future bid cities to re-visit the Ueberroth model for lessons in cost containment, and like Ueberroth, exhibit a willingness to explore novel, more cost-effective means for cities to host the Olympic Games. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",doi,10.1080/09523367.2014.958665,Scopus,International Journal of the History of Sport,Wenn S.R.,2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Phase Diagrams For An Evolutionary Prisoner's Dilemma Game On Two-Dimensional Lattices,The effects of payoffs and noise on the maintenance of cooperative behavior are studied in an evolutionary prisoner's dilemma game with players located on the sites of different two-dimensional lattices. This system exhibits a phase transition from a mixed state of cooperators and defectors to a homogeneous one where only the defectors remain alive. Using Monte Carlo simulations and the generalized mean-field approximations we have determined the phase boundaries (critical points) separating the two phases on the plane of the temperature (noise) and temptation to choose defection. In the zero temperature limit the cooperation can be sustained only for those connectivity structures where three-site clique percolation occurs. © 2005 The American Physical Society.,doi,10.1103/PhysRevE.72.047107,Scopus,"Physical Review E - Statistical, Nonlinear, and Soft Matter Physics","Szabó G., Vukov J., Szolnoki A.",2005,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,"Physical And Cognitive Stimulation Using An Exergame In Subjects With Normal Aging, Mild And Moderate Cognitive Impairment","Background: The use of Serious exerGames (SeG) as enriched environments (EE), which promotes cognitive simulation with physical activity in a positive emotional context, has been proposed to represent a powerful method to slow down the decline due to neurodegenerative diseases (ND), such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, so far, no SeG targeting EE has been tested in ND subjects. Objective: This study aimed at evaluating the usability and short-term training effects of X-Torp, an action SeG designed for elderly ND subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. Methods: X-Torp is a SeG played using the Microsoft® Kinect™. 10 ND subjects and 8 healthy elderly controls (HEC) were enrolled in a 1-month program with three training sessions per week. Usability was evaluated through game time, game performance, the aerobic intensity level reached, perceived emotions, and perceived usability. Results: All participants successfully completed the training program. ND subjects played less and had a lower game performance compared to HEC. During the sessions, ND subjects maintained a light intensity of aerobic activity, while HEC maintained a moderate intensity. Both groups experienced only positive emotions, and reported a 'moderate' to 'high' perceived competence, a 'moderate' game difficulty, and a 'high' interest in the game. Conclusion: Usability results suggest that X-Torp represents a usable EE for healthy subjects and persons with MCI and AD. However, in order to reach moderate or high intensity of aerobic activity, X-Torp control modes should be adapted to become more physically stimulating.",doi,10.3233/JAD-160268,Scopus,Journal of Alzheimer's Disease,"Ben-Sadoun G., Sacco G., Manera V., Bourgeois J., König A., Foulon P., Fosty B., Bremond F., D'Arripe-Longueville F., Robert P.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Physical And Physiological Demands Of Elite Team Handball,"Physical and physiological demands of elite team handball. J Strength Cond Res 26(12): 3365-3375, 2012-This study aimed to analyze elite team handball physical and physiological demands during match play. Time-motion (N = 30) and heart rate (HR; N = 60) analyses were performed throughout 10 official matches. The defined locomotor categories were standing still, walking, jogging, fast running, sprinting, backwards movement, sideways medium-intensity movement, and sideways high-intensity movement, and playing actions studied were jumps, shots, stops when preceded by high-intensity activities, changes of direction and one-on-one situations. During matches, the mean distances covered were 4,370 ± 702.0 m. Around 80% of the total time was spent standing still (43.0 ± 9.27%) and walking (35.0 ± 6.94%) and only 0.460.31% with sprinting. The most frequent high-intensity actions were stops, changes of direction, and one-on-one situations. Effective mean HR was 157 ± 18.0 b.min-1 (82 6 9.3% of HRmax), and total HR was 139 ± 31.9 b.min-1 (72 ± 16.7% of HRmax). The HR, time spent in high-intensity activities, frequency of stops, changes of direction, one-on-one situations, and most intense periods of the game were higher during the first half than during the second half (p ≤ 0.05). The opposite was observed for the number of time outs and the time between each change of activity (p = 0.00). Handball is an intermittent exercise that primarily uses aerobic metabolism, interspersed by high-intensity actions that greatly tax anaerobic metabolism. Additionally, exercise intensity decreases from the first to the second half of the match, suggesting that neuromuscular fatigue may occur during the game. The training of elite handball players should comprise exercises targeting the ability to perform specific high-intensity actions throughout the game and to rapidly recover during the less intense periods. © 2012 National Strength and Conditioning Association. © 2012 National Strength and Conditioning Association.",doi,10.1519/JSC.0b013e318248aeee,Scopus,Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research,"PoVoas S.C.A., Seabra A.F.T., AscensaO A.A.M.R., MagalhaEs J., Soares J.M.C., And Rebelo A.N.C.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Physical Health Promotion Through Modern Technologies: Challenges To Concerns,"Health promotion and the maintenance of the quality of life are realized recently. Advancement in technologies offer new possibilities for both the promotion of positive health behaviors that were unimaginable even a decade ago. Though promoting physical activity has been proven an important component of health promotion by many researchers, still a lot of efforts on how to improve physical activity being provided by group of researchers. Technology such as pedometers, accelerometers, and heart rate monitors have been used to promote physical activity for years. Newer technologies such as global positioning system (GPS), geographic information systems (GIS), interactive video games, and persuasive technology, Internet-based physical activity interventions have been used recently to promote and change exercise behavior. This chapter seeks to provide a complete insight of technologies used to changing health behaviors especially physical health promotion and will take a forward to analyses all the issues while using these technologies and future research directions. © 2016, IGI Global.

,Physiological Demands Of Water Polo Goalkeeping,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the physiological demands of water polo goalkeepers during competition and to examine whether the playing intensity of the goalkeeper decreases as the game time progresses. During eight official games the following measurements were performed on eight elite water polo goalkeepers: (1) video analysis of activities, (2) monitoring of blood lactate (BLa) and (3) continuous recording of heart rate (HR) responses. Mean HR of total mixed playing time, excluding breaks among quarters, was 134.3 ± 20.3 bpm for 36 (4 × 9) min of game duration. The large portion of the game (85.6%) was performed with a HR lower than 151.4 ± 2.7 bpm (82.1 ± 1.4% of HRpeak) an intensity corresponding to the players' anaerobic threshold (3.49 ± 0.60 mmol L-1). However, an important part of the game (14.4%) contained activities with sudden HR increases above the anaerobic threshold. Mean BLa accumulation at the end of each game period was 3.93 ± 1.64 mmol L-1. Individual lactate values varied from 2.0 to 8.3 mmol L-1. Goalkeeper exercise intensity reached its peak value (152.5 ± 10.1 bpm) whenever his team competed with one player less due to player exclusion. No significant differences were found in HR, BLa and the percentage of time spent in each of the activity categories between game periods. In conclusion, goalkeeper's game can be described as of intermittent nature with great variability in the intensity performed. The greater part of the game is associated with a low aerobic demand while an important part of the game contains activities with sudden HR increases above the anaerobic threshold implying also a considerable demand on anaerobic metabolism. The intensity of exercise of the goalkeeper does not differ from period to period. © 2007 Sports Medicine Australia.",doi,10.1016/j.jsams.2007.09.011,Scopus,Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport,Platanou T.,2009,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Physiological Reactivity And Type A Behavior In Preschool Children: A Longitudinal Study,"Measurements of Type A behavior were related to cardiovascular (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate) and neuroendocrine (urinary catecholamines and cortisol) reactivity in 30 male and 30 female preschool children during various active conditions at their mean ages of 3.5, 4.5, 5.5, and 6.5. Significant elevations of physiological arousal occurred in most active conditions and for all physiological variables except cortisol. Playgroup leaders in daycare centers filled out a Swedish version of the scale measuring Type A behavior, and boys obtained significantly higher scores than girls. Whereas Type A scores were relatively consistent over time, however, physiological reactivity was not a stable individual characteristic, and correlations between Type A scores and cardiovascular reactivity reached significance in only 4 of 33 tests for the boys (one negative correlation) and in 1 case for the girls. Correlations between Type A scores and catecholamine reactivity did not reach significance. In summary, the data do not support the assumption of a consistent relationship between Type A behavior and physiological reactivity in preschool children. A significant correlation (r =.57, p <.01) found for boys during a computer game suggests that an association may exist during “Type A-relevant” challenge. © 1992 Behavioral Medicine.

,Physiological Responses To Exergaming After Spinal Cord Injury,"Purpose: To investigate whether exergaming satisfies guideline-based intensity standards for exercise conditioning (40%/50% oxygen uptake reserve [VO2R] or heart rate reserve (HRR), or 64%/70% of peak heart rate [HRpeak]) in persons with paraplegia. Methods: Nine men and women (18-65 years old) with chronic paraplegia (T1-L1, AIS A-C) underwent intensity-graded arm cycle exercise (AE) to evaluate VO2peak and HRpeak On 2 randomized nonconsecutive days, participants underwent graded exercise using a custom arm cycle ergometer that controls the video display of a Nintendo Gamecube (GameCycle; Three Rivers Holdings LLC, Mesa, AZ) or 15 minutes of incrementally wrist-weighted tennis gameplay against a televised opponent (XaviX Tennis System; SSD Co Ltd, Kusatsu, Japan). Results: GameCycle exergaming (GCE) resistance settings ≥0.88 Nm evoked on average ≥50% VO2</ sub>R. During XaviX Tennis System exergaming (XTSE) with wrist weights ≥2 lbs, average VO2 reached a plateau of ~40% VO2R. Measurements of HR were highly variable and reached average values ≥50% HRR during GCE at resistance settings ≥0.88 Nm. During XTSE, average HR did not reach threshold levels based on HRR for any wrist weight (20%-35% HRR). Conclusions: On average, intensity responses to GCE at resistance setting ≥0.88 Nm were sufficient to elicit exercise intensities needed to promote cardiorespiratory fitness in individuals with SCI. The ability of XTSE to elicit cardiorespiratory fitness benefits is most likely limited to individuals with very low fitness levels and may become subminimal with time if used as a conditioning stimulus. © 2012 Thomas Land Publishers, Inc.",doi,10.1310/sci1804-331,Scopus,Topics in Spinal Cord Injury Rehabilitation,"Burns P., Kressler J., Nash M.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,"Physiological, Psychological, And Behavioral Factors And White Coat Hypertension","Patients with hypertension in the clinic but not during daily activities (""white coat"" hypertension) may be at lower risk of hypertensive morbidity and mortality than patients with hypertension in both settings (""persistent"" hypertension). We hypothesized that the white coat phenomenon was due to greater blood pressure reactivity to the stress of a clinic visit and that, as a consequence, white coat hypertensive patients would display greater blood pressure reactivity to exercise and mental stress, as well as increased emotional reactivity and higher levels of anger, anxiety, or depression. We studied 89 patients with essential hypertension between 29 and 59 years old with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, treadmill exercise testing with oxygen consumption measurement, mental stress testing (including mental arithmetic, public speaking, and video game tasks), and psychological testing (State-Trait Anxiety Scale, Cook-Medley Hostility Scale, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, emotional reactivity scale). We defined white coat hypertension as a mean ambulatory systolic blood pressure of 135 mm Hg or less and diastolic 85 mm Hg or less and persistent hypertension as a mean ambulatory systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or more or diastolic 90 mm Hg or more. Forty-nine patients were classified as persistent hypertensives and 20 as white coat hypertensives. No significant differences were seen in demographic or clinical characteristics, fitness level, blood pressure response to exercise or mental stress, or psychological characteristics, except that white coat hypertensive patients had lower systolic blood pressures in the clinic and during exercise and greater variability of clinic diastolic blood pressures. Thus, we were unable to distinguish white coat from persistent hypertensive patients by these clinical, demographic, emotional, or reactivity measures.",doi,10.1161/01.HYP.16.2.140,Scopus,Hypertension,"Siegel W.C., Blumenthal J.A., Divine G.W.",1990,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Playing A Violent Television Game Affects Heart Rate Variability,"Objective: To investigate how playing a violent/nonviolent television game during the evening affects sympathetic and parasympathetic reactions during and after playing as well as sleep quality during the night after playing. Subjects and Methods: In total, 19 boys, 12-15 years of age, played television games on two occasions in their homes and participated once without gaming. Heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV) and physical activity were measured during gaming/participating and the night to follow using a portable combined heart rate and movement sensor. A sleep diary and questionnaires about gaming experiences and session-specific experiences were filled in. Criteria for Selection of Games: Violent game involves/rewards direct physical violence (no handguns) against another person, and nonviolent game involves/rewards no violence; same game design ('third-person game'); conducted in the same manner; no differences concerning motor activity; similar sound and light effects; no sexual content, violence against women or racial overtones. Results: During violent (vs. nonviolent) gaming, there was significantly higher activity of the very low frequency component of the HRV and total power. During the night after playing, very low frequency, low frequency and high frequency components were significantly higher during the violent (vs. nonviolent) condition, just as total power. There were no significant differences between the three conditions (violent/nonviolent/no gaming) with respect to an index reflecting subjectively perceived sleep difficulties. Nor was there any difference between violent and nonviolent condition for any single sleep item. Conclusion: Violent gaming induces different autonomic responses in boys compared to nonviolent gaming - during playing and during the following night - suggesting different emotional responses. Subjectively perceived sleep quality is not influenced after a single gaming experience. Future studies should address the development of the autonomic balance after gaming over longer time than a night, physiological adaptation to frequent gaming and potential gender differences. © 2008 The Author(s).",doi,10.1111/j.1651-2227.2008.01096.x,Scopus,"Acta Paediatrica, International Journal of Paediatrics","Ivarsson M., Anderson M., Åkerstedt T., Lindblad F.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,"Playing A Violent Television Game Does Not Affect Saliva Cortisol. Acta Paediatrica, 98(6), 1052–3.","The role of playing a violent television game on saliva cortisol was investigated. Twenty-one boys, 12–15 years of age, participated in their homes between 8 and 10 pm on three different weekdays by playing a violent television game, playing a nonviolent game and not playing at all. A logarithm transformation was applied in the statistical computations to normalize the distribution of cortisol data. There were no significant differences in cortisol level between the violent and non-violent game, neither in the development before/after gaming (no significant interaction) nor at waking up the subsequent morning. The mean cortisol levels actually decreased across the games thereby not deviating from the normal circadian pattern. Also the overall pattern of cortisol showed the expected circadian shape with morning levels similar to those of boys of the same age in a Swedish normative sample. It was suggested that cortisol levels might usually not increase as a reaction to playing television games unless other stressors, like intense sound effects, were involved.

,"Playing Tetris For Science Counter-Regulatory Affective Processing In A Motivationally ""Hot"" Context","We adapted the computer game TETRIS to investigate the process of affective-motivational counter-regulation, that is, attentional biases for emotional stimuli that are in opposition to the momentary motivational focus. Counter-regulation is seen as a mechanism which should prevent escalation and impulsivity, and it should help to avoid becoming ""locked up"" in affective-motivational states. Accordingly, for a negative outcome focus condition (i.e., risk of losing a current high score), we hypothesized greater interference by positive distractors that were included in the game, whereas for a positive outcome focus (i.e., chance to improve one's current high score), we hypothesized greater interference by negative distractors. Supporting our hypotheses, we found the predicted interactions between distractor valence and type of outcome focus. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

,"Pre-Meal Screen-Time Activities Increase Subjective Emotions, But Not Food Intake In Young Girls","Purpose To determine the effect of pre-meal screen-time activities on subjective emotions, subjective appetite, and food intake (FI) in 9–14 year-old girls. Methods In this clinical study, 31 girls completed four 45-min treatment conditions of television viewing (TVV), video game playing (VGP), a challenging computer task (CT), and sitting without screen exposure (control) in a randomized order. Each treatment condition was followed immediately by an ad libitum pizza lunch, and FI was calculated from the weight of the consumed pizza. Subjective appetite was assessed at baseline, 15, 30, and 45 min during the treatment condition, and upon trial completion at 75 min. Subjective emotions were assessed at baseline and at 45 min. Results FI was not affected by screen type, but was positively correlated with body composition (fat mass [FM, kg], fat free mass [FFM, kg]) in all treatment conditions. Subjective appetite was not affected by screen type, but increased with time in all treatment conditions (p < 0.0001). Subjective emotions were affected by VGP only. Anger, excitement, frustration, and upset feelings were increased at 45 min following VGP. VGP led to increased frustration compared to control (p = 0.0003), CT (p = 0.007) and TVV (p = 0.0002). Conclusion Exposure to TVV or CT before eating did not affect subjective emotions, subjective appetite, or FI, and no difference was found between screen activities and the control condition for average appetite or FI. Despite a change in subjective emotions during the VGP condition, there was no increase in subjective appetite or subsequent FI. These findings suggest that physiologic signals of satiation and satiety are not overridden by environmental stimuli of pre-meal screen-time exposure among young girls.

,Predicting Dual-Task Performance With The Multiple Resources Questionnaire (Mrq),"Objective: The objective was to assess the validity of the Multiple Resources Questionnaire (MRQ) in predicting dual-task interference. Background: Subjective workload measures such as the Subjective Workload Assessment Technique (SWAT) and NASA Task Load Index are sensitive to single-task parameters and dual-task loads but have not attempted to measure workload in particular mental processes. An alternative is the MRQ. Method: In Experiment 1, participants completed simple laboratory tasks and the MRQ after each. Interference between tasks was then correlated to three different task similarity metrics: profile similarity, based on r2 between ratings; overlap similarity, based on summed minima; and overall demand, based on summed ratings. Experiment 2 used similar methods but more complex computer-based games. Results: In Experiment 1 the MRQ moderately predicted interference (r = +.37), with no significant difference between metrics. In Experiment 2 the metric effect was significant, with overlap similarity excelling in predicting interference (r = +.83). Mean ratings showed high diagnosticity in identifying specific mental processing bottlenecks. Conclusion: The MRQ shows considerable promise as a cognitive-process-sensitive workload measure. Application: Potential applications of the MRQ include the identification of dual-processing bottlenecks as well as process overloads in single tasks, preparatory to redesign in areas such as air traffic management, advanced flight displays, and medical imaging.

,Predicting Human Interactive Learning By Regret-Driven Neural Networks,"Much of human learning in a social context has an interactive nature: What an individual learns is affected by what other individuals are learning at the same time. Games represent a widely accepted paradigm for representing interactive decision-making. We explored the potential value of neural networks for modeling and predicting human interactive learning in repeated games. We found that even very simple learning networks, driven by regret-based feedback, accurately predict observed human behavior in different experiments on 21 games with unique equilibria in mixed strategies. Introducing regret in the feedback dramatically improved the performance of the neural network. We show that regret-based models provide better predictions of learning than established economic models.",doi,10.1126/science.1151185,Scopus,Science,"Marchiori D., Warglien M.",2008,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Predictors And Health Consequences Of Screen-Time Change During Adolescence - 1993 Pelotas (Brazil) Birth Cohort Study,"Purpose: To investigate screen-time change from early to mid adolescence, its predictors, and its influence on body fat, blood pressure, and leisure-time physical activity. Methods: We used data from a longitudinal prospective study, conducted among participants of the 1993 Pelotas (Brazil) Birth Cohort Study. At baseline, adolescents were, on average, 11 years old. They were later visited at age 15 years. Screen time was self-reported, accounting for the time spent watching television, playing video games, and using the computer. Several predictors were examined. The effect of screen-time change on some health outcomes was also analyzed. Results: Screen time increased on average 60 min/d from 11 to 15 years of age, for the 4,218 adolescents studied. The groups that presented the highest increases in screen time were male, wealthiest, those whose mothers had higher education, and adolescents with a history of school failure. There were positive associations between screen-time change and body mass index, skinfold thickness, waist circumference, and leisure-time physical activity at 15 years of age. Conclusions: Screen time increased from early to mid adolescence. This increment was higher among boys and the wealthiest adolescents.

,Preliminary Evidence For Increased Parasympathetic Activity During Social Inclusion And Exclusion In Adolescents With Functional Abdominal Pain,"Objective Peer victimization (e.g. social exclusion) has been shown to be associated with physical health problems such as functional somatic complaints and especially symptoms of pain. To date, no study has investigated the mechanisms underlying this association in clinical pediatric samples. The aim of this study was to evaluate the parasympathetic activity during a social exclusion experience in adolescents with functional abdominal pain (FAP). Methods Twenty adolecents with FAP and 21 matched healthy participants were compared regarding parameters of parasympathetic activation before, during, and after participating in the Cyberball-game, a well-established paradigm to induce social exclusion. Results Adolescents with FAP showed an increase in parasympathetic activation during both consecutive phases of the Cyberball game (inclusion as well as exclusion condition) whereas the healthy control group remained stable. There were no differences in subjective experience of in- and exclusion between the groups. Conclusion The parasympathetic activation pattern may indicate altered processing of social stimuli in adolescents with FAP. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",doi,10.1016/j.jpsychores.2017.05.008,Scopus,Journal of Psychosomatic Research,"Gulewitsch M.D., Jusyte A., Mazurak N., Weimer K., Schönenberg M.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Probabilistic Pursuit-Evasion Games: A One-Step Nash Approach,"This paper addresses the control of a team of autonomous agents pursuing a smart evader in a non-accurately mapped terrain. By describing the problem as a partial information Markov game, we are able to integrate map-learning and pursuit. We propose receding horizon control policies, in which the pursuers and the evader try to respectively maximize and minimize the probability of capture at the next time instant. Because this probability is conditioned to distinct observations for each team, the resulting game is nonzero-sum. When the evader has access to the pursuers' information, we show that a Nash solution to the one-step nonzero-sum game always exists. Moreover, we propose a method to compute the Nash equilibrium policies by solving an equivalent zero-sum matrix game. A simulation example shows the feasibility of the proposed approach.",doi,10.1109/CDC.2000.914136,Scopus,Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Decision and Control,"Hespanha J.P., Prandini M., Sastry S.",2e3,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Psychophysiological Responses To Appraisal Dimensions In A Computer Game,"A computer game was used to study psychophysiological reactions to emotion-relevant events. Two dimensions proposed by Scherer (1984a, 1984b) in his appraisal theory, the intrinsic pleasantness and goal conduciveness of game events, were studied in a factorial design. The relative level at which a player performed at the moment of an event was also taken into account. A total of 33 participants played the game while cardiac activity, skin conductance, skin temperature, and muscle activity as well as emotion self-reports were assessed. The self-reports indicate that game events altered levels of pride, joy, anger, and surprise. Goal conduciveness had little effect on muscle activity but was associated with significant autonomic effects, including changes to interbeat interval, pulse transit time, skin conductance, and finger temperature. The manipulation of intrinsic pleasantness had little impact on physiological responses. The results show the utility of attempting to manipulate emotion-constituent appraisals and measure their peripheral physiological signatures. © 2004 Psychology Press Ltd.",doi,10.1080/02699930341000167,Scopus,Cognition and Emotion,"van Reekum C.M., Johnstone T., Banse R., Etter A., Wehrle T., Scherer K.R.",2004,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Psychophysiological Responses To Background Brand Placements In Video Games,"Researchers have typically employed cognitive and affective measures to study the effectiveness of brand placements in video games. A psychophysiological approach to measuring effectiveness has been sorely lacking and is necessary to help both academics and practitioners further their understanding of how brand placements work. The current study measures individuals orienting responses in terms of increased skin conductance and decreased heart rate upon exposure to brands in video games. Results indicate that game players register background advertisements subconsciously even though they may not be able to explicitly recall them later. There were no differences between gamers and nongamers in the recall and recognition of brands from the video game. Furthermore, brands with preexisting favorable attitudes automatically received further processing, suggesting orienting response is an indicator of initial perception rather than further elaboration. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",doi,10.1080/00913367.2013.775800,Scopus,Journal of Advertising,"Gangadharbatla H., Bradley S., Wise W.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Quality-Based Resource Brokerage For Autonomous Networked Multimedia Applications,"In this paper, we assume that the network resources are managed by several brokers, which are endowed with resources by a (remote) central resource manager according to several predetermined policies. Our focus is on autonomous multimedia users. We propose a novel resource management scheme, where resource brokers choose well-suited axiomatic bargaining solutions to divide their allocated resources among the users associated with them. These resource division solutions enable resource brokers to provide strict minimum video quality guarantees according to the (varying) number of multimedia users associated with them. Finally, we show that the proposed solution enables us to model the problem of selecting resource brokers by multimedia users as an unweighted congestion game, thereby ensuring convergence to a stationary distribution of users across resource brokers. We investigate the number of required users' switches to reach the stationary distribution, and quantify the fairness of the stationary distribution by introducing a novel quality fairness comparison metric for the users. © 2009 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TCSVT.2009.2026983,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology,"Park H., Van Der Schaar M.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Quantifying Head Impact Exposure In Collegiate Women's Soccer,"Objective: The aim of this study was to quantify head impact exposure for a collegiate women's soccer team over the course of the 2014 season. Design: Observational and prospective study. Setting: Virginia Tech women's soccer games and practices. Participants: Twenty-six collegiate level women's soccer players with a mean player age of 19 ± 1. Interventions: Participating players were instrumented with head impact sensors for biomechanical analysis. Video recordings of each event were used to manually verify each impact sustained. Main Outcome Measures: Head impact counts by player position and impact situation. Results: The sensors collected data from a total of 17 865 accelerative events, 8999 of which were classified as head impacts. Of these, a total of 1703 impacts were positively identified (19% of total real impacts recorded by sensor), 90% of which were associated with heading the ball. The average number of impacts per player per practice or game was 1.86 ± 1.42. Exposure to head impact varied by player position. Conclusions: Head impact exposure was quantified through 2 different methods, which illustrated the challenges associated with autonomously collecting acceleration data with head impact sensors. Users of head impact data must exercise caution when interpreting on-field head impact sensor data. © 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.",doi,10.1097/JSM.0000000000000313,Scopus,Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine,"Press J.N., Rowson S.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas

,Relationship Of Body Composition To Stress-Induced Pressure Natriuresis In Youth,"The contribution of stress to obesity-related cardiovascular disease is uncertain. The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of body composition on stress-induced pressure natriuresis. Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry was performed in 127 African American and white youths to assess lean body mass (LBM), fat mass (FM), and total percentage of body fat (%BF). The stress protocol was comprised of a 2-h baseline period, 1-h video game competition stressor, and 2-h recovery period. Blood and urine samples were collected hourly and blood pressure (BP) was obtained at 15-min intervals. Both BP and urinary sodium excretion(U NaV) increased from baseline to stress and returned to prestress levels after stress (P =. 001 for each). The BP levels and changes were positively correlated with LBM. In contrast, levels and changes in sodium excretion U NaV were inversely correlated with FM and %BM. Multiple regression analyses that included ethnicity, sex, angiotensin II (Ang II), and measures of body composition in the models indicated the following: a) LBM was the best predictor of stress systolic BP and independently contributed with ethnicity to stress diastolic BP; b) ethnicity was the only independent predictor of the stress-related change in systolic and diastolic BP; c) LBM was the only independent predictor of the change in BP from stress to recovery for both systolic and diastolic BP; and d) total percent body fat accounted for 11.2% of the variance of stress U NaV, with Ang II contributing an additional 6.1%. Based on the results of this study, ethnicity and body composition are related to stress-induced pressure natriuresis. © 2004 American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.amjhyper.2004.05.007,Scopus,American Journal of Hypertension,"Wilson M.E., Harshfield G.A., Ortiz L., Hanevold C., Kapuka G., MacKey L., Gillis D., Edmonds L., Evans C.",2004,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Role-Playing Video Games And Emotion: How Transportation Into The Narrative Mediates The Relationship Between Immoral Actions And Feelings Of Guilt,"Several studies have shown that exposure to media violence can lead to strong emotional reactions. This may be particularly true for video game violence and anger. Yet, few studies have explored the relationship between video game play and more complex emotions, such as guilt and shame. Further, prior research has not explored how exposure to the narratively rich violence found in role-playing video games may cause feelings of guilt. The research experiment presented here (n 184) aims to fill this gap in the literature by explaining how the immoral actions of a video game character impact the player's feelings of guilt. Specifically, results show that playing as a video game character that has committed immoral actions caused players to feel guilty and ashamed, especially if they felt transported or ""wrapped-up"" in the narrative. Exposure to immoral actions also caused players to show increases in aggressive behavioral tendencies. © 2015 American Psychological Association.",doi,10.1037/ppm0000084,Scopus,Psychology of Popular Media Culture,"Mahood C., Hanus M.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Role Of Virtual Reality For Cerebral Palsy Management.,"Virtual reality is the use of interactive simulations to present users with opportunities to perform in virtual environments that appear, sound, and less frequently, feel similar to real-world objects and events. Interactive computer play refers to the use of a game where a child interacts and plays with virtual objects in a computer-generated environment. Because of their distinctive attributes that provide ecologically realistic and motivating opportunities for active learning, these technologies have been used in pediatric rehabilitation over the past 15 years. The ability of virtual reality to create opportunities for active repetitive motor/sensory practice adds to their potential for neuroplasticity and learning in individuals with neurologic disorders. The objectives of this article is to provide an overview of how virtual reality and gaming are used clinically, to present the results of several example studies that demonstrate their use in research, and to briefly remark on future developments.",doi,10.1177/0883073814533007,pubmed,Journal of child neurology,"Weiss, Patrice L Tamar; Tirosh, Emanuel; Fehlings, Darcy",2015,NA,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,"Sadness, Suicide, And Their Association With Video Game And Internet Overuse Among Teens: Results From The Youth Risk Behavior Survey 2007 And 2009","We investigated the association between excessive video game/Internet use and teen suicidality. Data were obtained from the 2007 and 2009 Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS), a high school-based, nationally representative survey (N = 14,041 and N = 16,410, respectively). Teens who reported 5 hours or more of video games/Internet daily use, in the 2009 YRBS, had a significantly higher risk for sadness (adjusted and weighted odds ratio, 95% confidence interval = 2.1, 1.7-2.5), suicidal ideation (1.7, 1.3-2.1), and suicide planning (1.5, 1.1-1.9).

,Screen-Based Sedentary Behavior During Adolescence And Pulmonary Function In A Birth Cohort,"Background: Adolescents spend many hours in sitting activities as television viewing, video game playing and computer use. The relationship between sedentary behavior and respiratory health remains poorly elucidated. To date there have been no studies evaluating the relationship between sedentary behavior and pulmonary function in young populations. The purpose of this study is to examine the association between the trajectory of screen-based sedentary behavior from 11 to 18 years and pulmonary function at 18 years in a Brazilian birth cohort. Methods: Data from a longitudinal prospective study conducted among the participants of the 1993 Pelotas (Brazil) Birth Cohort. Time spent on television, video games, and computers during a weekday was self-reported at ages 11, 15 and 18 years. For each age, sedentary behavior was defined as the sum of time spent on these screen-based activities. To evaluate the sedentary behavior trajectory during adolescence group-based trajectory modeling was used. Outcome variables were three pulmonary function parameters: forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and peak expiratory flow (PEF), evaluated by spirometry, at 18 years expressed as z-scores. Crude and adjusted linear regressions, stratified by sex, were performed. Results: The three-group trajectory of sedentary behavior was the best fitting model. The trajectory groups were: always high (representing 38.8% of the individuals), always moderate (54.1%), and always low (7.1%). In the adjusted analyses, boys in the always-low group for sedentary behavior had higher FVC at 18 years (β = 0.177; 95% CI:0.027;0.327; p = 0.021) than boys in the always-high group. There were no differences for other pulmonary function parameters in boys. No significant association was found for girls. Conclusion: The trajectory of screen-based sedentary behavior throughout adolescence was not consistent associated with pulmonary function at 18 years. © 2017 The Author(s).",doi,10.1186/s12966-017-0536-5,Scopus,International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity,"da Silva B.G.C., Menezes A.M.B., Wehrmeister F.C., Barros F.C., Pratt M.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Secure Cooperation In Autonomous Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks Under Noise And Imperfect Monitoring: A Game-Theoretic Approach,"In autonomous mobile ad-hoc networks, one major challenge is to stimulate cooperation among selfish nodes, especially when some nodes may be malicious. In this paper, we address cooperation stimulation in realistic yet challenging contexts where the environment is noisy and the underlying monitoring is imperfect. We have first explored the underlying reasons why stimulating cooperation under such scenarios is difficult. Instead of trying to enforce all nodes to act fully cooperatively, our goal is to stimulate cooperation in a hostile environment as much as possible through playing conditional altruism. To formally address the problem, we have modeled the interactions among nodes as secure routing and packet forwarding games under noise and imperfect observation, and devised a set of reputation-based attack-resistant cooperation strategies without requiring any tamper-proof hardware or central banking service. The performance of the devised strategies has also been evaluated analytically. The limitations of the game-theoretic approaches and the practicability of the devised strategies have also been investigated through theoretical analysis and extensive simulation studies. The results have demonstrated that although sometimes a gap may exist between the ideal game model and the reality, game-theoretic analysis can still provide thoughtful insights and useful guidelines when designing cooperation strategies. © 2008 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TIFS.2008.922453,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,"Yu W., Liu K.J.R.",2008,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Sedentary Behaviour And Clustered Metabolic Risk In Adolescents: The Helena Study,"Background and aims: Although sedentary behaviours are linked with mortality for cardiovascular reasons, it is not clear whether they are negatively related with cardio-metabolic risk factors. The aim was to examine the association between time engaged in television (TV) viewing or playing with videogames and a clustered cardio-metabolic risk in adolescents. Methods and results: Sedentary behaviours and physical activity were assessed in 769 adolescents (376 boys, aged 12.5-17.5 years) from the HELENA-CSS study. We measured systolic blood pressure, HOMA index, triglycerides, TC/HDL-c, VO2max and the sum of four skinfolds, and a clustered metabolic risk index was computed. A multilevel regression model (by Poisson) was performed to calculate the prevalence ratio of having a clustered metabolic risk. In boys, playing &gt;4h/day with videogames (weekend) and moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) was associated with cardio-metabolic risk after adjustment for age, maternal education and MVPA. In contrast, TV viewing was not associated with the presence of cardio-metabolic risk. Conclusion: In boys, playing with videogames may impair cardio-metabolic health during the adolescence. Adolescents should be encouraged to increase their participation in physical activity of at least moderate intensity to obtain a more favourable risk factor profile. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",doi,10.1016/j.numecd.2012.06.006,Scopus,"Nutrition, Metabolism and Cardiovascular Diseases","Rey-López J.P., Bel-Serrat S., Santaliestra-Pasías A., de Moraes A.C., Vicente-Rodríguez G., Ruiz J.R., Artero E.G., Martínez-Gómez D., Gottrand F., De Henauw S., Huybrechts I., Polito A., Molnar D., Manios Y., Moreno L.A.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Seeing Without Looking: The Effects Of Hemispheric Functioning On Memory For Brands In Computer Games,"The authors hypothesize that the effectiveness of in-game advertising is influenced by two inborn traits, bisected hemispheric functioning and physiological arousal, that are at the core of human behavior. A 2 (preattentive processing type) × 2 (arousal level) between-subjects design was employed in both Experiment 1 (well-known brand placement) and Experiment 2 (lesser-known brand placement). The results from the two experiments reveal that people show better recognition memory for in-game ads when brand names are presented peripherally in the right visual field and brand images are embedded peripherally in the left visual field. In addition, people can remember more brand ads when they experience less arousal (Experiment 1). This effect, however, is attenuated when unfamiliar brands are placed in the game (Experiment 2). Implications are discussed for further investigation. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",doi,10.1080/00913367.2013.774587,Scopus,Journal of Advertising,"Yoon G., Vargas P.T.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Self-Learning Fuzzy Logic Controllers For Pursuitevasion Differential Games,"This paper addresses the problem of tuning the input and the output parameters of a fuzzy logic controller. The system learns autonomously without supervision or a priori training data. Two novel techniques are proposed. The first technique combines Q(λ)-learning with function approximation (fuzzy inference system) to tune the parameters of a fuzzy logic controller operating in continuous state and action spaces. The second technique combines Q(λ)-learning with genetic algorithms to tune the parameters of a fuzzy logic controller in the discrete state and action spaces. The proposed techniques are applied to different pursuitevasion differential games. The proposed techniques are compared with the classical control strategy, Q(λ)-learning only, reward-based genetic algorithms learning, and with the technique proposed by Dai et al. (2005) [19] in which a neural network is used as a function approximation for Q-learning. Computer simulations show the usefulness of the proposed techniques. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

,Self-Organization Of Vocabularies Under Different Interaction Orders,"Traditionally, the formation of vocabularies has been studied by agent-based models (primarily, the naming game) in which random pairs of agents negotiate word-meaning associations at each discrete time step. This article proposes a first approximation to a novel question: To what extent is the negotiation of word-meaning associations influenced by the order in which agents interact? Automata networks provide the adequate mathematical framework to explore this question. Computer simulations suggest that on two-dimensional lattices the typical features of the formation of word-meaning associations are recovered under random schemes that update small fractions of the population at the same time; by contrast, if larger subsets of the population are updated, a periodic behavior may appear. © 2017 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",doi,10.1162/ARTL_a_00230,Scopus,Artificial Life,Vera J.,2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Self-Regulation Of Slow Cortical Potentials In Psychiatric Patients: Depression,"Findings on depressive patients indicate that depressives have electrophysiological characteristics similar to those of schizophrenics, in that they exhibit reduced Contingent Negative Variation (CNV) amplitudes and more distinct Postimperative Negative Variations (PINVs) than normal controls. In a biofeedback experiment, 8 medicated male inpatients with the DSM III-R diagnosis of ""Bipolar Disorder, Depressive,"" and ""Major Depression"" demonstrated no impairment in the self-regulation of Slow Cortical Potentials (SCP) in comparison to schizophrenics in terms of increasing and suppressing negativity. Continuous visual SCP feedback is presented to the patient as a horizontally moving rocket in a video game format. The direction changes of the rocket represented SCP changes at each point in time, recorded by the central EEG (based on the pretrial baseline). Depressives demonstrated SCP self-regulation across 20 sessions, although with many between-and-within variations. The 8 male controls were unable to regulate their SCPs across 5 sessions. This result contradicts other findings of our laboratory on normal controls.

,Sensory Realism And Mediated Aggression In Video Games,"This study investigated whether sensory realism cues in violent games - blood color (red vs. blue), screams of pain (on vs. off), and player perspective (first-person vs. third-person) - affect players' physiological arousal (i.e.; skin conductance levels), spatial presence (i.e.; sense of being physically ""there""), and state aggression in a popular violent game (Half-Life 2), controlling for users' prior game experiences. A path model (N = 160) was examined to see the mediation effects of arousal and presence between realism cues and state aggression. In line with the general aggression model, results showed that realistic blood color and screams increased arousal, but no effect was found for first-person perspective. Presence significantly affected users' state aggression. However, contrary to our expectation based on the excitation transfer theory, arousal did not show any significant effect on aggression. In addition, presence mediated the influence of realistic blood color on state aggression. In the effects of graphic realism of violence on user aggression, presence did a crucial role. Implications and future studies were discussed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

,Sentoy: An Affective Sympathetic Interface,"We describe the design and implementation of SenToy: a tangible doll with sensors that allows a user to influence the emotions of a synthetic character in a game. SenToy is an input device that allows the user to perform gestures or movements that the sensors inside the doll pick up. The gestures are interpreted according to a scheme found through two different user studies: one Wizard of Oz study and one study with a fully functioning SenToy. Different gestures express one of the following emotions: anger, fear, surprise, sadness, gloating and happiness. Depending upon the expressed emotion, the synthetic character in the game will, in turn, perform different actions (trading, duelling, etc.). The evaluation of SenToy acting as the interface to the computer game Fantasy A has shown that the users were able to express the desired emotions to influence the synthetic characters, and that overall players liked the doll as an interface. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

,Serotonin And Dopamine Play Complementary Roles In Gambling To Recover Losses,"Continued gambling to recover lossesloss chasingis a prominent feature of social and pathological gambling. However, little is known about the neuromodulators that influence this behavior. In three separate experiments, we investigated the role of serotonin activity, D 2 /D 3 receptor activity, and beta-adrenoceptor activity on the loss chasing of age and IQ-matched healthy adults randomized to treatment or an appropriate control/placebo. In Experiment 1, participants consumed amino-acid drinks that did or did not contain the serotonin precursor, tryptophan. In Experiment 2, participants received a single 176 g dose of the D 2 /D 3 receptor agonist, pramipexole, or placebo. In Experiment 3, participants received a single 80 mg dose of the beta-adrenoceptor blocker, propranolol, or placebo. Following treatment, participants completed a computerized loss-chasing game. Mood and heart rate were measured at baseline and following treatment. Tryptophan depletion significantly reduced the number of decisions made to chase losses, and the number of consecutive decisions to chase, in the absence of marked changes in mood. By contrast, pramipexole significantly increased the value of losses chased and diminished the value of losses surrendered. Propranolol markedly reduced heart rate, but produced no significant changes in loss-chasing behavior. Loss chasing can be thought of as an aversively motivated escape behavior controlled, in part, by the marginal value of continued gambling relative to the value of already accumulated losses. Serotonin and dopamine appear to play dissociable roles in the tendency of individuals to gamble to recover, or to seek to escape from, previous losses. Serotonergic activity seems to promote the availability of loss chasing as a behavioral option, whereas D 2 /D 3 receptor activity produces complex changes in the value of losses judged worth chasing. Sympathetic arousal, at least as mediated by beta-adrenoceptors, does not play a major role in laboratory-based loss-chasing choices. © 2011 American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.

,Simulation Of Autonomous Crowd Behaviour On Xbox 360,"A crowd simulator which creates autonomous characters’ behaviour in crowds consists many components such as pathfinding, collision avoidance, character creation, behaviour system, and level of details. The majority of these involve different level of decision making in order to simulate autonomous agents’ behaviour. Some components have a few different algorithms that can be adopted. For a simulator with a large number of autonomous agents, these components need to be efficient to contribute to the creation of a faster and cheaper game environment. Otherwise bottlenecks may occur and this can led to a poor representation. In this paper we investigate these areas, discuss and compare existing approaches in each component, and select the best combination on Xbox 360 through a series of experiments on our crowd simulator within the Microsoft XNA framework. We used the Xbox 360 console for accurate testing which is not affected by other processes running in the background. We also optimise the application to overcome bottleneck issues. Our simulator is able to handle a large number of automonous agents with a healthy frame rate of 60 FPS. Based on our implementation and testing results, some recommendations are provided in this paper, which will be useful for independent game developers who create games containing autonomous crowd for Xbox 360 using XNA framework. © 2011 - IOS Press and the authors.",doi,10.3233/IDT-2011-0110,Scopus,Intelligent Decision Technologies,"Brittain M., Ma M.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Social Characters For Computer Games,"Many current video games feature virtual worlds inhabited by autonomous 3D animated characters. These characters often fall short in their ability to participate in social interactions with each other or with people. Increasing the social capabilities of game characters could increase the potential of games as a platform for social learning. This article presents advances in the area of social autonomous character design. Specifically, a computational model of social relationship formation is described. This model formed the basis for a game entitled “AlphaWolf” that allows people to play the role of newborn pups in a pack of virtual wolves, helping the pups to find their place in the social order of the pack. This article offers the results from a 32-subject user study that assessed the social relationship model, showing that it effectively represents the core elements of social relationships in a way that is perceivable by people. Additionally, this article proposes a game that will allow parents, teachers and children to experiment with computational social behavior through social virtual characters. This research contributes to the development of games for social learning by offering a set of viable algorithms for computational characters to form social relationships, and describing a project that could utilize this model to enable children to learn social skills by interacting with game characters. © 2005, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",doi,10.1108/17415650580000036,Scopus,Interactive Technology and Smart Education,Tomlinson B.,2005,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas

There is research to suggest that storytelling in video games can be beneficial because it can be used to help players identify with characters and their goals, creating a greater sense of immersion, positive feelings, and more physiological arousal. Furthermore, when the content is specific and targeted, these games are well suited for promoting acquisition, maintenance, and generalization of skills and knowledge. Findings such as these hold immense promise in the context of improving social skills for children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Thus, the use of computers and video games, combined with more traditional storytelling, may serve as hopeful tools for motivating and engaging students as well as promoting learning. This chapter expounds upon this line of reasoning and explores the use of interactive storytelling games as an effective intervention in social skills development for children with ASD. © 2014, IGI Global.

,Sociocultural Games For Training And Analysis,"This paper presents a theory for role-playing simulation games intended to support analysts (and trainees) with generating and testing alternative competing hypotheses on how to influence world conflict situations. Simulated leaders and followers capable of playing these games are implemented in a cognitive modeling framework, called the Performance Moderator Function Server (PMFserv), which covers value systems, personality and cultural factors, emotions, relationships, perception, stress/coping style, and decision making. Of direct interest, as I-A explains, is codification and synthesis of best-of-breed social-science models within PMFserv to improve the internal validity of agent implementations. II and III present this for leader profiling instruments and group-membership decision making, respectively. IV then offers two real-world case studies (The Third Crusade and SE Asia Today) where agent models are subjected to Turing and correspondence tests under each case study. In sum, substantial effort on game realism, best-of-breed social-science models, and agent validation efforts is essential if analysis and training tools are to help explore cultural issues and alternative ways to influence outcomes. Such exercises, in turn, are likely to improve the state of the science as well. © 2007 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TSMCA.2007.906574,Scopus,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Part A:Systems and Humans","Silverman B.G., Bharathy G., Johns M., Eidelson R.J., Smith T.E., Nye B.",2007,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Soft-Computing-Based Emotional Expression Mechanism For Game Of Computer Go,"The game of Go is considered one of the most complicated games in the world. One Go game is divided into three stages: the opening, the middle, and the ending stages. Millions of people regularly play Go in countries around the world. The game is played by two players. One is White and another is Black. The players alternate placing one of their stones on an empty intersection of a square grid-patterned game board. The player with more territory wins the game. This paper proposes a soft-computing-based emotional expression mechanism and applies it to the game of computer Go to make Go beginners enjoy watching Go game and keep their tension on the game. First, the knowledge base and rule base of the proposed mechanism are defined by following the standards of the fuzzy markup language. The soft-computing mechanism for Go regional alarm level is responsible for showing the inferred regional alarm level to Go beginners. Based on the inferred board situation, the fuzzy inference mechanisms for emotional pleasure and arousal are responsible for inferring the pleasure degree and arousal degree, respectively. An emotional expression mapping mechanism maps the inferred degree of pleasure and degree of arousal into the emotional expression of the eye robot. The protocol transmission mechanism finally sends the pre-defined protocol to the eye robot via universal serial bus interface to make the eye robot express its emotional motion. From the experimental results, it shows that the eye robot can support Go beginners to have fun and retain their tension while watching or playing a game of Go. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",doi,10.1007/s00500-012-0963-9,Scopus,Soft Computing,"Lee C.-S., Wang M.-H., Wu M.-J., Nakagawa Y., Tsuji H., Yamazaki Y., Hirota K.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas

,Sound For Fantasy And Freedom,"Sound is an integral part of our everyday lives. Sound tells us about physical events in the environment, and we use our voices to share ideas and emotions through sound. When navigating the world on a day-to-day basis, most of us use a balanced mix of stimuli from our eyes, ears and other senses to get along. We do this totally naturally and without effort. In the design of computer game experiences, traditionally, most attention has been given to vision rather than the balanced mix of stimuli from our eyes, ears and other senses most of us use to navigate the world on a day to day basis. The risk is that this emphasis neglects types of interaction with the game needed to create an immersive experience. This chapter summarizes the relationship between sound properties, GameFlow and immersive experience and discusses two projects in which Interactive Institute, Sonic Studio has balanced perceptual stimuli and game mechanics to inspire and create new game concepts that liberate users and their imagination. © 2011, IGI Global.",doi,10.4018/978-1-61692-828-5.ch002,Scopus,Game Sound Technology and Player Interaction: Concepts and Developments,Liljedahl M.,2010,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Speech-Based Recognition Of Self-Reported And Observed Emotion In A Dimensional Space,"The differences between self-reported and observed emotion have only marginally been investigated in the context of speech-based automatic emotion recognition. We address this issue by comparing self-reported emotion ratings to observed emotion ratings and look at how differences between these two types of ratings affect the development and performance of automatic emotion recognizers developed with these ratings. A dimensional approach to emotion modeling is adopted: the ratings are based on continuous arousal and valence scales. We describe the TNO-Gaming Corpus that contains spontaneous vocal and facial expressions elicited via a multiplayer videogame and that includes emotion annotations obtained via self-report and observation by outside observers. Comparisons show that there are discrepancies between self-reported and observed emotion ratings which are also reflected in the performance of the emotion recognizers developed. Using Support Vector Regression in combination with acoustic and textual features, recognizers of arousal and valence are developed that can predict points in a 2-dimensional arousal-valence space. The results of these recognizers show that the self-reported emotion is much harder to recognize than the observed emotion, and that averaging ratings from multiple observers improves performance. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

,Sram Circuit Design,"Today's mobile computing and communication devices such as video phone, handheld video games, etc., represent the most important factors driving the need for low power design. The commercial success of these devices depends significantly on the duration of autonomous operation. This class of products therefore requires low power consumption as well as high or medium performance, which in turn depends on the technology and the design techniques used. For cost and reliability issues the preferred components for implementation of state-of-the-art portable devices are System-on-Chip (SoC) ICs. The SoC integrates many functions such as digital, memory, analog mixed-signal, and often radio-frequency functions, all on one chip. To satisfy requirements of multimedia applications, SoCs embed Static-Random-Access-Memory modules (SRAM), which occupy more than 60% of the total SoC area and are responsible for a large portion of the total power consumption. Therefore, the SRAM module is required to have both high operating performance to deal with multimedia applications and low power consumption to prolong battery life. Active power consumption of CMOS logic circuits increases quadrati-cally with supply voltage; hence, minimizing the supply voltage is one of the most effective ways to reduce energy usage but unfortunately this comes at the expense of lower speed. To get the best trade-off, supply voltage and threshold voltage scaling along with process is needed. However the increase of leakage current limits the threshold voltage reduction as well as the supply voltage scaling. Moreover, in 45 nm technology and below, voltage scaling becomes very complex due to the difficulty of the SRAM operation. In fact, in order to achieve very high density, the SRAM cell is implemented with the smallest size MOS transistors, which in turn are more and more impacted by the increase of process fluctuations. It results in many obstacles to overcome to achieve low-voltage operation, such as adequate read margin, write ability and operating speed [1]. © 2009 Springer Netherlands.",doi,10.1007/978-1-4020-9341-8_8,Scopus,Planar Double-Gate Transistor: From Technology to Circuit,"Giraud B., Thomas O., Amara A., Vladimirescu A., Belleville M.",2009,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Stability Of Cooperative Management Of The Pacific Sardine Fishery Under Climate Variability,"Asymmetry in transboundary fish stock distribution caused by climate variability can make the stability of cooperative management challenging. Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax), which exhibits extreme decadal variability in abundance and geographic distribution corresponding to water temperature regime shifts within the California Current Ecosystem, is expected to face such issues. Pacific sardine is a transboundary resource targeted by Mexican, U.S. and Canadian fisheries. Our study applies a three-agent game theoretic model that incorporates environmental effects on Pacific sardine abundance and biomass distribution. Simulations are conducted to evaluate the stability of full and partial cooperative management of the Pacific sardine fishery, under seven different climate variability scenarios. Our results show that ocean climate variability could motivate the formation of stable cooperative management outcomes for the Pacific sardine fisheries operated by Canada, the U.S. and Mexico. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.marpol.2012.12.008,Scopus,Marine Policy,"Ishimura G., Herrick S., Sumaila U.R.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Strategic Formation Of Heterogeneous Networks,"We establish a network formation game for the Internet's autonomous system (AS) interconnection topology. The game includes different types of players, accounting for the heterogeneity of ASs in the Internet. In this game, the utility of a player depends on the network structure, e.g., the distances between nodes and the cost of links. Our model is versatile and can accommodate various configurations: whether monetary transfers are allowed, whether survivability requirements are imposed or not, and if so, whether failures are frequent or rare. We analyze static properties of the game as well as its dynamic evolution. We provide a dynamic analysis of topological quantities, and explain the prevalence of some 'network motifs' in the Internet connectivity graph. We assess our predictions with real-world data. © 1983-2012 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/JSAC.2017.2672339,Scopus,IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications,"Meirom E.A., Mannor S., Orda A.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Strategies For Repeated Games With Subsystem Takeovers Implementable By Deterministic And Self-Stabilising Automata,"Systems of selfish-computers are subject to transient faults due to temporal malfunctions; just as the society is subjected to human mistakes. Game theory uses punishment for deterring improper behaviour. Due to faults, selfish-computers may punish well-behaved ones. This is one of the key motivations for forgiveness that follows any effective and credible punishment. Therefore, unplanned punishments must provably cease in order to avoid infinite cycles of unsynchronised behaviour of 'tit for tat'. We investigate another aspect of these systems. We consider the possibility of subsystem takeover. The takeover may lead to joint deviations coordinated by an arbitrary selfish-computer that controls an unknown group of subordinate computers. We present strategies that deter the coordinator from deviating in infinitely repeated games. We construct deterministic automata that implement these strategies with optimal complexity. Moreover, we prove that all unplanned punishments eventually cease by showing that the automata can recover from transient faults.

,"Strutting Hero, Sneaking Villain: Utilizing Body Motion Cues To Predict The Intentions Of Others","A better understanding of how intentions and traits are perceived from body movements is required for the design of more effective virtual characters that behave in a socially realistic manner. For this purpose, realistic body motion, captured from human movements, is being used more frequently for creating characters with natural animations in games and entertainment. However, it is not always clear for programmers and designers which specific motion parameters best convey specific information such as certain emotions, intentions, or traits. We conducted two experiments to investigate whether the perceived traits of actors could be determined from their body motion, and whether these traits were associated with their perceived intentions. We first recorded body motions from 26 professional actors, who were instructed to move in a ""hero""-like or a ""villain""-like manner. In the first experiment, 190 participants viewed individual video recordings of these actors and were required to provide ratings to the body motion stimuli along a series of different cognitive dimensions (intentions, attractiveness, dominance, trustworthiness, and distinctiveness). The intersubject ratings across observers were highly consistent, suggesting that social traits are readily determined from body motion. Moreover, correlational analyses between these ratings revealed consistent associations across traits, for example, that perceived ""good"" intentions were associated with higher ratings of attractiveness and dominance. Experiment 2 was designed to elucidate the qualitative body motion cues that were critical for determining specific intentions and traits from the hero- and villain-like body movements. The results revealed distinct body motions that were readily associated with the perception of either ""good"" or ""bad"" intentions. Moreover, regression analyses revealed that these ratings accurately predicted the perception of the portrayed character type. These findings indicate that intentions and social traits are communicated effectively via specific sets of body motion features. Furthermore, these results have important implications for the design of the motion of virtual characters to convey desired social information. © 2015 ACM.",doi,10.1145/2791293,Scopus,ACM Transactions on Applied Perception,"Kiiski H., Hoyet L., Woods A.T., O'Sullivan C., Newell F.N.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Susceptibility To Induced Visual Discomfort During The Menstrual Cycle While Viewing A Visual Display Unit,"Purpose. Consistent variations in reports of visual discomfort during the female menstrual cycle are found when virtual reality headsets are used to display moving images. Because little is known about the influence of this cycle on susceptibility to visual discomfort in other situations, we performed a laboratory study using an intensive visual task. Methods. Twelve female participants, with normal-length menstrual cycles, completed the study. This required them to play a computer game for 30 minutes while viewing the screen through -2.00-D lenses. Questionnaires were used to record symptom changes; visual acuity and near points of accommodation (NPA) and convergence (NPC) were also recorded both before and after the game. The participants performed this task on designated days (5, 12, 19, and 26) of their menstrual cycle chosen because they fall in line with peaks and troughs of ovarian hormone levels. Cycle phase was confirmed by the measurement of salivary estradiol and progesterone levels. Results. The task performed produced clear changes in all metrics examined. Visual discomfort first increased, on average, after 6 minutes; VA declined on average by 0.02 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution and NPC and NPA both receded by just over 1 cm. However, none of these changes differed significantly at any stage of the menstrual cycle. Conclusions. We conclude that visual discomfort, generated by providing increased accommodative demand while viewing a visual display unit, does not vary significantly during the menstrual cycle.

,Sustained Efficacy Of Virtual Reality Distraction,"The current study tested whether the effectiveness of distraction using virtual reality (VR) technology in reducing cold pressor pain would maintain over the course of 8 weekly exposures. Twenty-eight adults, 18 to 23 years of age, underwent 1 baseline cold pressor trial and 1 VR distraction trial in randomized order each week. VR distraction led to significant increases in pain threshold and pain tolerance and significant decreases in pain intensity, time spent thinking about pain, and self-reported anxiety, relative to baseline. Repeated exposure did not appear to affect the benefits of VR. Implications for the long-term use of VR distraction as a nonpharmacological analgesic are discussed. Perspective: This article addresses the concern that the efficacy of virtual reality-assisted distraction from pain could potentially decrease with repeated exposure. The current finding that efficacy did not diminish over several repeated exposures provides support for the use of virtual reality as an adjuvant treatment of pain. © 2009 American Pain Society.",doi,10.1016/j.jpain.2008.09.016,Scopus,Journal of Pain,"Rutter C.E., Dahlquist L.M., Weiss K.E.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas

Technical actions, heart rate, and locomotor activity in 7v7 and 8v8 games for female youth soccer players. J Strength Cond Res 30(12): 3298-3303, 2016-The purpose of this study was to evaluate technical performance, heart rate (HR), and activity profile in 7v7 and 8v8 soccer games for 9-to 10-year-old girls (U11). A total of 24 female youth players participated in the study, all playing 20-minute 7v7 and 8v8 games with 160 and 223 m 2 per player, respectively. Technical actions, HR, and activity profile were measured during the games using video filming, HR monitors, and 5-Hz Global positioning system (GPS) units. The number of technical actions was higher in 7v7 than in 8v8 games (34 ± 19 vs. 28 ± 14; p = 0.03; d = 0.37), as was the number of successful actions (25 ± 16 vs. 20 ± 12; p = 0.01; d = 0.35), with no difference in success rate for technical actions (70 ± 13 vs. 69 ± 14%; p = 0.63; d = 0.07). No differences were found between 7v7 and 8v8 in total distance covered (1,574 ± 251 and 1,622 ± 281 m; p = 0.66; d = 0.18), peak speed (19.5 ± 2.6 and 20.7 ± 1.5 km·h-1; p = 0.16; d = 0.56), mean HR values (85 ± 5 and 86 ± 6%HRpeak; p = 0.85; d = 0.18), and time of >90% HRpeak (37 ± 16 and 35 ± 14% of playing time; p = 0.70; d = 0.13). Distance covered at the highest running speeds of >16 km·h-1 was lower in 7v7 than in 8v8 games (34 ± 24 vs. 63 ± 34 m; p = 0.018; d = 0.98), as was the number of entries into this speed zone (8 ± 5 vs. 13 ± 7; p = 0.006; d = 0.82). In conclusion, more technical actions and successful actions were observed in 7v7 than in 8v8 games, but players covered more ground with high-speed running in 8v8 games.

,The American Psychological Association Task Force Assessment Of Violent Video Games: Science In The Service Of Public Interest,"A task force of experts was convened by the American Psychological Association (APA) to update the knowledge and policy about the impact of violent video game use on potential adverse outcomes. This APA Task Force on Media Violence examined the existing literature, including the meta-analyses in the field, since the last APA report on media violence in 2005. Because the most recent meta-analyses were published in 2010 and reflected work through 2009, the task force conducted a search of the published studies from 2009-2013. These recently published articles were scored and assessed by a systematic evidentiary review, followed by a meta-analysis of the high utility studies, as documented in the evidentiary review. Consistent with the literature that we reviewed, we found that violent video game exposure was associated with: an increased composite aggression score; increased aggressive behavior increased aggressive cognitions; increased aggressive affect, increased desensitization, and decreased empathy and increased physiological arousal. The size of the effects was similar to that in prior meta-analyses, suggesting a stable result. Our task force concluded that violent video game use is a risk factor for adverse outcomes, but found insufficient studies to examine any potential link between violent video game use and delinquency or criminal behavior.

,The Asthma Epidemic And Our Artificial Habitats,"Background: The recent increase in childhood asthma has been a puzzling one. Recent views focus on the role of infection in the education of the immune system of young children. However, this so called hygiene hypothesis fails to answer some important questions about the current trends in asthma or to account for environmental influences that bear little relation to infection. Discussion: The multi-factorial nature of asthma, reflecting the different ways we tend to interact with our environment, mandates that we look at the asthma epidemic from a broader perspective. Seemingly modern affluent lifestyles are placing us increasingly in static, artificial, microenvironments very different from the conditions prevailed for most part of our evolution and shaped our organisms. Changes that occurred during the second half of the 20th century in industrialized nations with the spread of central heating/conditioning, building insulation, hygiene, TV/PC/games, manufactured food, indoor entertainment, cars, medical care, and sedentary lifestyles all seem to be depriving our children from the essential inputs needed to develop normal airway function (resistance). Asthma according to this view is a manifestation of our respiratory maladaptation to modern lifestyles, or in other words to our increasingly artificial habitats. The basis of the artificial habitat notion may lie in reduced exposure of innate immunity to a variety of environmental stimuli, infectious and non-infectious, leading to reduced formulation of regulatory cells/cytokines as well as inscribed regulatory pathways. This could contribute to a faulty checking mechanism of non-functional Th2 (and likely Th1) responses, resulting in asthma and other immuno-dysregulation disorders. Summary: In this piece I discuss the artificial habitat concept, its correspondence with epidemiological data of asthma and allergy, and provide possible immunological underpinning for it from an evolutionary perspective of health and disease. © 2005 Maziak; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",doi,10.1186/1471-2466-5-5,Scopus,BMC Pulmonary Medicine,Maziak W.,2005,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,The Communicative Function Of Sad Facial Expressions,"What are the communicative functions of sad facial expressions? Research shows that people feel sadness in response to losses but it’s unclear whether sad expressions function to communicate losses to others and if so, what makes these signals credible. Here we use economic games to test the hypothesis that sad expressions lend credibility to claims of loss. Participants play the role of either a proposer or recipient in a game with a fictional backstory and real monetary payoffs. The proposers view a (fictional) video of the recipient’s character displaying either a neutral or sad expression paired with a claim of loss. The proposer then decided how much money to give to the recipient. In three experiments, we test alternative theories by using situations in which the recipient’s losses were uncertain (Experiment 1), the recipient’s losses were certain (Experiment 2), or the recipient claims failed gains rather than losses (Experiment 3). Overall, we find that participants gave more money to recipients who displayed sad expressions compared to neutral expressions, but only under conditions of uncertain loss. This finding supports the hypothesis that sad expressions function to increase the credibility of claims of loss. © The Author(s) 2017.",doi,10.1177/1474704917700418,Scopus,Evolutionary Psychology,"Reed L.I., DeScioli P.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,The Design Of The M-Health Service Application Using A Nintendo Ds Game Console,"In this article, we developed an m-health monitoring system using a Nintendo DS game console to demonstrate its utility. The proposed system consists of a biosignal acquisition device, wireless sensor network, base-station for signal reception from the sensor network and signal conversion according to Internet protocol, personal computer display program, and the Nintendo DS game console. The system collects three-channel electrocardiogram (ECG) signals for cardiac abnormality detection and three-axis accelerometer signals for fall detection of a person. The collected signals are then transmitted to the base-station through the wireless sensor network, where they are transformed according to the transmission control protocol/Internet protocol (TCP/IP) and sent to the destination IP through Internet network. To test the developed system, the collected signals were displayed on a computer located in different building through wired Internet network and also simultaneously displayed on the Nintendo DS game console connected to Internet network wirelessly. The system was able to collect and transmit signals for more than 24 h without any interruptions or malfunctions, showing the possibility of integrating healthcare monitoring functions into a small handheld-type electronic device developed for different purposes without significant complications. It is expected that the system can be used in an ambulance, nursing home, or general hospital where efficient patient monitoring from long distance is necessary. © Copyright 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",doi,10.1089/tmj.2010.0080,Scopus,Telemedicine and e-Health,"Lee S., Kim J., Lee M.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,The Effect Of Exergaming On Vascular Function In Children,"Objectives: To assess whether exergaming can induce measurable changes in heart rate (HR), energy expenditure (EE), and flow-mediated dilation (FMD) arterial function in healthy children. Study design: Fifteen children (8 males, 10.1 ± 0.7 years, body mass index 17.9 ± 2.4 kg.m-2) undertook a graded exercise test and 2 × 15 minute exergaming sessions (Xbox 360â€Kinect); high intensity exergaming (HiE, Kinect Sports-200 m Hurdles) and low intensity exergaming (LoE, Kinect Sports-Ten Pin Bowling). Brachial artery FMD, a measure of endothelial function and arterial health, was measured before and immediately after each exergaming intervention. Actihearts were used to measure EE and HR during game play and a physical activity enjoyment scale assessed enjoyment. Results: Average HR during HiE (146 ± 11 beats per minute) was greater than during LoE (104 ± 11 beats per minute, P &lt;.05), a pattern reinforced by EE data (HiE 294.6 ± 75.2 J.min-1.kg-1, LoE 73.7 ± 44.0 J.min -1.kg-1, P &lt;.05). FMD decreased after HiE (P &lt;.05), whereas no change was observed following LoE. Subjects reported no differences in enjoyment between LoE and HiE. Conclusion: HiE, but not LoE, induced large HR and EE responses that were associated with effects on vascular function. This study suggests that an acute bout of HiE exergaming may provide a substrate for beneficial arterial adaptations in children. © 2013 Mosby Inc.

,"The Effect Of The Amount Of Blood In A Violent Video Game On Aggression, Hostility, And Arousal","The current study utilized the General Aggression Model, with an emphasis on aggression-related priming, to explore the different effects on hostility, physiological arousal, and state aggression in those who played a violent video game (Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance) with differing levels of blood (maximum, medium, low, and off). Simple effects analyses showed that those in the maximum blood and medium blood conditions had a significant increase in hostility and physiological arousal, while those in the low blood and no blood conditions did not have such an increase in arousal and hostility. Further analyses indicated that those in the maximum and medium blood conditions used the character's weapon significantly more often than those in the low and blood absent conditions.

,The Effect Of Type A Personality On Physiological Arousal While Playing Computer Games,"Despite the widespread use of computer games, there is a lack of systematic research in the area-particularly on their ""addictiveness"" potential. Anecdotal evidence suggests that computer game addiction may be due to arousal properties of computer games, although other factors may be important. This study examined the relationship between Type A personality and arousal in computer-game play. It was hypothesised that, during computer-game play, Type A and Type B subjects would have significantly higher heart rates as compared with baseline levels and that Type A subjects would experience a significantly greater increase in arousal when playing a computer game than Type B subjects. These hypotheses were both supported and the results are discussed in relation to arousal, personality, and addiction. © 1995.",doi,10.1016/0306-4603(95)00001-S,Scopus,Addictive Behaviors,"Griffiths M.D., Dancaster I.",1995,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,The Effectiveness And Usability Of The Educational Software On Concept Education For Young Children With Impaired Hearing,"Early intervention and early education have a special place in educating the children with Impaired Hearing (IH). The advancements in information and communication technologies have led to adopting the view that such technologies could be applied in the educational process of the children with IH. Besides, the positive results acquired in the studies conducted in the light of this review have brought up the fact that proper technology-based educational environments should be provided and popularized for the young children with IH. In this study, educational software has been developed for the purpose of teaching emotions and opposite concepts to young children with IH. With this software, videos with topic descriptions, games reinforcing funny and topic-based learning, questions and audio-visual feedbacks have been used. The effectiveness of this software in concept education along with its usability by children has been examined; and in addition, the subjective viewpoints of the teachers of students with IH on this software have been consulted as well. © 2016 by iSER, International Society of Educational Research.",doi,10.12973/eurasia.2016.1207a,Scopus,"Eurasia Journal of Mathematics, Science and Technology Education","Goker H., Ozaydin L., Tekedere H.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,The Effects Of Music On Time Perception And Performance Of A Driving Game,"Cassidy, G.G. & MacDonald, R.A.R. (2010). The effects of music on time perception and performance of a driving game. Scandinavian Journal of Psychology 51, 455-464.There is an established and growing body of evidence highlighting that music can influence behavior across a range of diverse domains (Miell, MacDonald, & Hargreaves 2005). One area of interest is the monitoring of ""internal timing mechanisms"", with features such as tempo, liking, perceived affective nature and everyday listening contexts implicated as important (North & Hargreaves, 2008). The current study addresses these issues by comparing the effects of self-selected and experimenter-selected music (fast and slow) on actual and perceived performance of a driving game activity. Seventy participants completed three laps of a driving game in seven sound conditions: (1) silence; (2) car sounds; (3) car sounds with self-selected music, and car sounds with experimenter-selected music; (4) high-arousal (70 bpm); (5) high-arousal (130 bpm); (6) low-arousal (70 bpm); and (7) low-arousal (130 bpm) music. Six performance measures (time, accuracy, speed, and retrospective perception of these), and four experience measures (perceived distraction, liking, appropriateness and enjoyment) were taken. Exposure to self-selected music resulted in overestimation of elapsed time and inaccuracy, while benefiting accuracy and experience. In contrast, exposure to experimenter-selected music resulted in poorest performance and experience. Increasing the tempo of experimenter-selected music resulted in faster performance and increased inaccuracy for high-arousal music, but did not impact experience. It is suggested that personal meaning and subjective associations connected to self-selected music promoted increased engagement with the activity, overriding detrimental effects attributed to unfamiliar, less liked and less appropriate experimenter-selected music. © 2010 The Authors.

,The Effects Of Nursing Interventions Utilizing Serious Games That Promote Health Activities On The Health Behaviors Of Seniors,"Objectives: Seniors, during their senescence, experience difficulties when engaging in physical, social, and leisure activities. Meanwhile, increased access to information technology in recent years among seniors has led to the increased applicability of games aiding senior activities that incorporate information technology. In this study, we constructed and assessed a nursing intervention incorporating an actual walking exercise game developed for the use of seniors in order to identify the cognitive, social, and physical impact it has on their health behaviors. Subjects and Method: This quasi-experimental study used a one-group pre-/post-test design in which 15 people 65 years of age or older were selected to participate through a serious health game conducted at the senior welfare center twice a week, for 12 weeks. Besides having their basic physical measurements taken, seniors participated in physical exercise sessions that included educational content. The measured variables were health beliefs and concerns, subjective knowledge, subjective norms, perceived reliability, perceived ease of use and usefulness, perceived behavioral control, attitudes about health behaviors, intentions to perform health behaviors, health behaviors, blood pressure, pulse rate, endurance, agility and balance, and flexibility. Results: Significant increases in health beliefs and concerns, perceived reliability, perceived behavioral control, perceived ease of use, attitudes about health behaviors, and intentions to perform health behaviors were observed at post-test, compared with pre-test data points. These increases were also recorded for physical domains. Significant increases in systolic blood pressure and pulse rates were noted immediately after the intervention, along with increased endurance levels, indicating that the exercise had an effect on participants' health. Conclusions: Ongoing research is required regarding the development and impact of distinctive nursing interventions, conducted through various forms of serious health games relatively easy to use, by integrating various motivating factors for engaging in health behaviors and the entertainment value of such games. © Copyright 2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2015.",doi,10.1089/g4h.2014.0124,Scopus,Games for Health Journal,"Lee H.-Y., Kim J., Kim K.S.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,The Evolutionary Dynamics Of A Population Model With A Strong Allee Effect,"An evolutionary game theoretic model for a population subject to predation and a strong Allee threshold of extinction is analyzed using, among other methods, Poincaré-Bendixson theory. The model is a nonlinear, plane autonomous system whose state variables are population density and the mean of a phenotypic trait, which is subject to Darwinian evolution, that determines the population's inherent (low density) growth rate (fitness). A trade-off is assumed in that an increase in the inherent growth rate results in a proportional increase in the predator's attack rate. The main results are that orbits equilibrate (there are no cycles or cycle chains of saddles), that the extinction set (or Allee basin) shrinks when evolution occurs, and that the meant trait component of survival equilibria occur at maxima of the inherent growth rate (as a function of the trait).",doi,10.3934/mbe.2015.12.643,Scopus,Mathematical Biosciences and Engineering,Cushing J.M.,2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,The Feasibility Of Ambulatory Screen Time In Children,"Purpose. A walking media station was developed, which enables normally seated screen activities to be conducted whilst walking. This study tests feasibility of the walking media station and provides preliminary evidence of the acceptability of the device in the home environment. Methods. Twenty-nine healthy children (mean age 9.6 years) participated in the testing of the newly developed walking media station in the laboratory and in the home environment. Results. Steady gait walking at1 km.hr-1 was achieved by all the children in less than 1 minute. There was no significant difference between computer game score during seated and walking play modes and no increase in energy cost when computer game play was added to walking (p &gt; 0.05). When given the choice in the home, all chose to use the walking media station rather than play seated. When asked: ""If this unit were yours to keep forever, would you play video games on it?"" all responded affirmatively. Conclusion. These data demonstrate that when given a walking media station, children can and will use it. Re-engineering regular walking into otherwise seated gaming minimizes disruption to normal routines and provides an innovative and creative opportunity for further investigation into the sustainability and clinical outcomes of reducing sitting time and increasing physical activity.",doi,10.1080/17477160802315002,Scopus,International Journal of Pediatric Obesity,"Mellecker R.R., McManus A.M., Lanningham-Foster L.M., Levine J.A.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,The Future Of Weather Forecasting,"The Met Office, Britain, currently takes in 106 million observations a day from weather balloons, satellites and commercial aeroplanes around the world. Its existing supercomputer then integrates the weather observations into modeling software to predict the world's weather. The office currently uses an IBM POWER7, a 1.2 -petaflop machine. The new supercomputer is a 16-petaflop Cray XC40. It will have two million gigabytes of memory available to run calculations the equivalent of 120,000 smartphones. There will be over 17 million gigabytes of storage capacity. It will run at speeds of more than 1.5 terabytes bandwidth and use 480,000 cores, that's more processing power than 100,000 PlayStation 4 games consoles. With the new computer, the Met Office hopes to run 1.5km forecasts every hour. Forecasters will be able to zoom in on particular regions to produce detailed local forecasts down to 300m resolution, which is useful for predicting localized weather conditions like fog at airports, strong winds, and heavy snowfall. Met Office experts will also be able to analyze data once an hour rather than the current six hours, and give forecasts six days ahead instead of four. The computer will enable them to calculate temperatures for the next 24 hours with up to 90 per cent accuracy. The Met Office also believes the computer will help scientists make more accurate climate change predictions and will facilitate forward-looking climate simulations and models that better assess how climate change will affect weather systems.",doi,10.1049/et.2015.0207,Scopus,Engineering and Technology,Andrews C.,2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,The Impact Of Recreational Video Game Play On Children's And Adolescents' Cognition,"Current empirical findings show linkages between recreational video game play and enhanced cognitive skills, primarily among young adults. However, consideration of this linkage among children and adolescents is sparse. Thus, discussions about facilitating transfer of cognitive skills from video game play to academic tasks among children and adolescents remains largely uninformed by research. To inform this discussion, we review available research concerning the cognitive benefits of video game play among children and adolescents and their impressions of video games as learning tools as these impressions may impact their application of cognitive skills used during game play to academic tasks. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., A Wiley Company.",doi,10.1002/cad.20030,Scopus,New Directions for Child and Adolescent Development,"Blumberg F.C., Altschuler E.A., Almonte D.E., Mileaf M.I.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,The Impact Of Social Exclusion Vs. Inclusion On Subjective And Hormonal Reactions In Females And Males,"Background: The experience of social exclusion represents an extremely aversive and threatening situation in daily life. The present study examined the impact of social exclusion compared to inclusion on steroid hormone concentrations as well as on subjective affect ratings. Methods: Eighty subjects (40 females) participated in two independent behavioral experiments. They engaged in a computerized ball tossing game in which they ostensibly played with two other players who deliberately excluded or included them, respectively. Hormone samples as well as mood ratings were taken before and after the game. Results: Social exclusion led to a decrease in positive mood ratings and increased anger ratings. In contrast, social inclusion did not affect positive mood ratings, but decreased sadness ratings. Both conditions did not affect cortisol levels. Testosterone significantly decreased after being excluded in both genders, and increased after inclusion, but only in males. Interestingly, progesterone showed an increase after both conditions only in females. Discussion: Our results suggest that social exclusion does not trigger a classical stress response but gender-specific changes in sex hormone levels. The testosterone decrease after being excluded in both genders, as well as the increase after inclusion in males can be interpreted within the framework of the biosocial status hypothesis. The progesterone increase might reflect a generalized affiliative response during social interaction in females. © 2013 The Authors.",doi,10.1016/j.psyneuen.2013.07.021,Scopus,Psychoneuroendocrinology,"Seidel E.M., Silani G., Metzler H., Thaler H., Lamm C., Gur R.C., Kryspin-Exner I., Habel U., Derntl B.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,The Important Role Of The Context In Which Achievement Goals Are Adopted: An Experimental Test,"Two experimental studies using Elliot, Murayama, and Pekrun’s (Journal of Educational Psychology 103(3):632–648, 2011) differentiation between self-goals and task-goals, were conducted to examine the relative influence of achievement goals and motivational contexts on behavioral and emotional engagement. In Study 1, 133 college students were prompted to adopt self-goals (intrapersonal standards) or other-goals (performance standards) in one of two motivational contexts (autonomy-supportive or autonomy-suppressive) while playing a computer game. In Study 2, 129 college students performed the same assignment, this time adopting either other-goals or task-goals (absolute standards). Study 1 indicated that autonomy-support facilitated behavioral and emotional engagement in autonomy suppressive contexts, but self-goals merely promoted emotional engagement relative to other-goals. Study 2 replicated Study 1’s findings by showing that autonomy support promoted self-reported behavioral engagement and task-goals promoted emotional engagement but further revealed that only when task-goals were adopted in an autonomy-supportive context did they promote better behavioral engagement than other-goals. Thus, Study 2 highlighted the importance of the context in which the achievement goals were adopted (i.e., autonomy-supportive versus suppressive) as an important determinant of the outcome. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",doi,10.1007/s11031-016-9600-8,Scopus,Motivation and Emotion,"Benita M., Shane N., Elgali O., Roth G.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,The Influence Of Combined Cognitive Plus Social-Cognitive Training On Amygdala Response During Face Emotion Recognition In Schizophrenia,"Both cognitive and social-cognitive deficits impact functional outcome in schizophrenia. Cognitive remediation studies indicate that targeted cognitive and/or social-cognitive training improves behavioral performance on trained skills. However, the neural effects of training in schizophrenia and their relation to behavioral gains are largely unknown. This study tested whether a 50-h intervention which included both cognitive and social-cognitive training would influence neural mechanisms that support social ccognition. Schizophrenia participants completed a computer-based intervention of either auditory-based cognitive training (AT) plus social-cognition training (SCT) (N=11) or non-specific computer games (CG) (N=11). Assessments included a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) task of facial emotion recognition, and behavioral measures of cognition, social cognition, and functional outcome. The fMRI results showed the predicted group-by-time interaction. Results were strongest for emotion recognition of happy, surprise and fear: relative to CG participants, AT+SCT participants showed a neural activity increase in bilateral amygdala, right putamen and right medial prefrontal cortex. Across all participants, pre-to-post intervention neural activity increase in these regions predicted behavioral improvement on an independent emotion perception measure (MSCEIT: Perceiving Emotions). Among AT+SCT participants alone, neural activity increase in right amygdala predicted behavioral improvement in emotion perception. The findings indicate that combined cognition and social-cognition training improves neural systems that support social-cognition skills. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.pscychresns.2013.04.001,Scopus,Psychiatry Research - Neuroimaging,"Hooker C.I., Bruce L., Fisher M., Verosky S.C., Miyakawa A., D'Esposito M., Vinogradov S.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas

,The Influence Of Personality Traits On Emotion Expression In Bulimic Spectrum Disorders: A Pilot Study,"Facial expressions are critical in forming social bonds and in signalling one's emotional state to others. In eating disorder patients, impairments in facial emotion recognition have been associated with eating psychopathology severity. Little research however has been carried out on how bulimic spectrum disorder (BSD) patients spontaneously express emotions. Our aim was to investigate emotion expression in BSD patients and to explore the influence of personality traits. Our study comprised 28 BSD women and 15 healthy controls. Facial expressions were recorded while participants played a serious video game. Expressions of anger and joy were used as outcome measures. Overall, BSD participants displayed less facial expressiveness than controls. Among BSD women, expressions of joy were positively associated with reward dependence, novelty seeking and self-directedness, whereas expressions of anger were associated with lower self-directedness. Our findings suggest that specific personality traits are associated with altered emotion facial expression in patients with BSD.

,The Iowa Gambling Task In Fmri Images,"The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) is a sensitive test for the detection of decision-making impairments in several neurological and psychiatric populations. Very few studies have employed the IGT in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) investigations, in part, because the task is cognitively complex. Here we report a method for exploring brain activity using fMRI during performance of the IGT. Decision-making during the IGT was associated with activity in several brain regions in a group of healthy individuals. The activated regions were consistent with the neural circuitry hypothesized to underlie somatic marker activation and decision-making. Specifically, a neural circuitry involving the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (for working memory), the insula and posterior cingulate cortex (for representations of emotional states), the mesial orbitofrontal and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (for coupling the two previous processes), the ventral striatum and anterior cingulate/SMA (supplementary motor area) for implementing behavioral decisions was engaged. These results have implications for using the IGT to study abnormal mechanisms of decision making in a variety of clinical populations. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",doi,10.1002/hbm.20875,Scopus,Human Brain Mapping,"Li X., Lu Z.-L., D'Argembeau A., Ng M., Bechara A.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,The Mental Simulation Of Better And Worse Possible Worlds,"Counterfactual thinking involves the imagination of non-factual alternatives to reality. We investigated the spontaneous generation of both upward counterfactuals, which improve on reality, and downward counterfactuals, which worsen reality. All subjects gained $5 playing a computer-simulated blackjack game. However, this outcome was framed to be perceived as either a win, a neutral event, or a loss. “Loss” frames produced more upward and fewer downward counterfactuals than did either “win” or “neutral” frames, but the overall prevalence of counterfactual thinking did not vary with outcome valence. In addition, subjects who expected to play the game again made more upward counterfactuals and were less satisfied with the outcome than were subjects who did not expect to play again. However, once subjects saw the cards from which they could have selected had they ""hit"" again (two winning cards and two losing cards), all subjects generated primarily upward counterfactuals and showed a corresponding decrease in satisfaction. These results implicate both cognitive and motivational factors in the generation of counterfactuals and tell us something about the functional value of counterfactual thinking: downward counterfactuals provide comfort; upward counterfactuals prepare one for the future. © 1993 by Academic Press, Inc.",doi,10.1006/jesp.1993.1005,Scopus,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,"Markman K.D., Gavanski I., Sherman S.J., McMullen M.N.",1993,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,The Neurodynamics Of Affect In The Laboratory Predicts Persistence Of Real-World Emotional Responses,"Failure to sustain positive affect over time is a hallmark of depression and other psychopathologies, but the mechanisms supporting the ability to sustain positive emotional responses are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the neural correlates associated with the persistence of positive affect in the real world by conducting two experiments in humans: an fMRI task of reward responses and an experience-sampling task measuring emotional responses to a reward obtained in the field. The magnitude of DLPFC engagement to rewards administered in the laboratory predicted reactivity of real-world positive emotion following a reward administered in the field. Sustained ventral striatum engagement in the laboratory positively predicted the duration of real-world positive emotional responses. These results suggest that common pathways are associated with the unfolding of neural processes over seconds and with the dynamics of emotions experienced over minutes. Examining such dynamics may facilitate a better understanding of the brain-behavior associations underlying emotion. © 2015, the authors.",doi,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0569-15.2015,Scopus,Journal of Neuroscience,"Heller A.S., Fox A.S., Wing E.K., McQuisition K.M., Vack N.J., Davidson R.J.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,The Path Between Pedagogy And Technology: Establishing A Theoretical Basis For The Development Of Educational Game Environments,"The power of computer game technology is currently being harnessed to produce ""serious games"". These ""games"" are targeted at the education and training marketplace, and employ various key game-engine components such as the graphics and physics engines to produce realistic ""digital-world"" simulations of the real ""physical world"". Many approaches are driven by the technology and often lack a consideration of a firm pedagogical underpinning. The authors believe that an analysis and deployment of both the technological and pedagogical dimensions should occur together, with the pedagogical dimension providing the lead. This chapter explores the relationship between these two dimensions, and explores how ""pedagogy may inform the use of technology"", how various learning theories may be mapped onto the use of the affordances of computer game engines. Autonomous and collaborative learning approaches are discussed. The design of a serious game is broken down into spatial and temporal elements. The spatial dimension is related to the theories of knowledge structures, especially ""concept maps"". The temporal dimension is related to ""experiential learning"", especially the approach of Kolb. The multi-player aspect of serious games is related to theories of ""collaborative learning"" which is broken down into a discussion of ""discourse"" versus ""dialogue"". Several general guiding principles are explored, such as the use of ""metaphor"" (including metaphors of space, embodiment, systems thinking, the internet and emergence). The topological design of a serious game is also highlighted. The discussion of pedagogy is related to various serious games we have recently produced and researched, and is presented in the hope of informing the ""serious game community"". © 2009, IGI Global.",doi,10.4018/978-1-60566-360-9.ch012,Scopus,Games-Based Learning Advancements for Multi-Sensory Human Computer Interfaces: Techniques and Effective Practices,Price C.,2009,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,"The Pedisedate® Device, A Novel Approach To Pediatric Sedation That Provides Distraction And Inhaled Nitrous Oxide: Clinical Evaluation In A Large Case Series","Background: Pediatric sedation is of paramount importance but can be challenging. Fear and anticipatory anxiety before invasive procedures often lead to uncooperativeness. A novel device (PediSedate®) provides sedation through a combination of inhaled nitrous oxide and distraction (video game). We evaluated the acceptability and safety of the PediSedate® device in children. Methods: We enrolled children between 3 and 9 years old who were scheduled to undergo surgical procedures that required general inhalational anesthesia. After the device was applied, he/she played a video game while listening to the audio portion of the game through the earphones. Nitrous oxide in oxygen was administered via the nasal piece of the headset starting at 50% and increasing to 70%, in 10% increments every 8 min. Treatment failures, vital signs, arterial oxygen saturation, depth of sedation, airway patency, side effects, acceptance of the device and parental satisfaction were all evaluated. Results: Of 100 children included, treatment failure occurred in 18% mainly because of poor tolerance of the device. At least 96% of the children who completed the study exhibited an excellent degree of sedation, 22% had side effects, and none experienced serious airway obstruction. Nausea and vomiting were the most common side effects and no patients had hemodynamic instability. Conclusions: The PediSedate® device combines nonpharmacologic with pharmacologic methods of sedation. Most of the children we evaluated were able to tolerate the PediSedate® device and achieved an adequate degree of sedation. © 2007 The Authors.",doi,10.1111/j.1460-9592.2006.02091.x,Scopus,Paediatric Anaesthesia,"Denman W.T., Tuason P.M., Ahmed M.I., Brennen L.M., Soledad Cepeda M., Carr D.B.",2007,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas

,"The Psychophysiology Of Flow During Piano Playing. Emotion, 10(3), 301–311.","Expert performance is commonly accompanied by a subjective state of optimal experience called flow. Previous research has shown positive correlations between flow and quality of performance and suggests that flow may function as a reward signal that promotes practice. Here, piano playing was used as a flow-inducing behavior in order to analyze the relationship between subjective flow reports and psychophysiological measures. Professional classical pianists were asked to play a musical piece and then rate state flow. The performance was repeated five times in order to induce a variation in flow, keeping other factors constant, while recording the arterial pulse pressure waveform, respiration, head movements, and activity from the corrugator supercilii and zygomaticus major facial muscles. A significant relation was found between flow and heart period, blood pressure, heart rate variability, activity of the zygomaticus major muscle, and respiratory depth. These findings are discussed in relation to current models of emotion, attention, and expertise, and flow is proposed to be a state of effortless attention, which arises through an interaction between positive affect and high attention.",doi,10.1037/a0018432,nagy2015,Emotion,"De Manzano, Ö., Theorell, T., Harmat, L., Ullén, F.",2010,NA,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,The Psychophysiology Of James Bond: Phasic Emotional Responses To Violent Video Game Events,"The authors examined emotional valence- and arousal-related phasic psychophysiological responses to different violent events in the first-person shooter video game ""James Bond 007: NightFire"" among 36 young adults. Event-related changes in zygomaticus major, corrugator supercilii, and orbicularis oculi electromyographic (EMG) activity and skin conductance level (SCL) were recorded, and the participants rated their emotions and the trait psychoticism based on the Psychoticism dimension of the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised, Short Form. Wounding and killing the opponent elicited an increase in SCL and a decrease in zygomatic and orbicularis oculi EMG activity. The decrease in zygomatic and orbicularis oculi activity was less pronounced among high Psychoticism scorers compared with low Psychoticism scorers. The wounding and death of the player's own character (James Bond) elicited an increase in SCL and zygomatic and orbicularis oculi EMG activity and a decrease in corrugator activity. Instead of joy resulting from victory and success, wounding and killing the opponent may elicit high-arousal negative affect (anxiety), with high Psychoticism scorers experiencing less anxiety than low Psychoticism scorers. Although counterintuitive, the wounding and death of the player's own character may increase some aspect of positive emotion. © 2008 American Psychological Association.",doi,10.1037/1528-3542.8.1.114,Scopus,Emotion,"Ravaja N., Turpeinen M., Saari T., Puttonen S., Keltikangas-Järvinen L.",2008,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas

,"The Relation Of Flow-Experience And Physiological Arousal Under Stress — Can U Shape It? Journal Of Experimental Social Psychology, 53, 62–69.","In this study, we investigate the relationship between stress and flow-experience with the help of psychophysiological arousal indicators. Whereas recent studies suggest a positive relation between flow and physiological arousal, so far nothing is known on the relation between flow and high arousal in response to a salient stressor. We here suggest that the relation of flow with sympathetic arousal and hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis activation follows an inverted u-curve rather than a linear function: moderate physiological arousal should facilitate flow-experience, whereas excessive physiological arousal should hinder flow. In order to experimentally stimulate high physiological arousal, we exposed 22 healthy male participants to a modified version of the Trier Social Stress Test. Then, participants had to perform a complex computer task for 60 minutes and to rate their flow-experience on the Flow Short-Scale directly after task completion. During the experiment, cortisol samples were taken every 15 minutes, and heart rate variability measures were assessed by continuous electrocardiography. We found an inverted u-shaped relationship of flow-experience with indices of sympathetic arousal and cortisol, whereas parasympathetic indices of heart rate control during stress were linearly and positively correlated with flow-experience. Our results suggest that moderate sympathetic arousal and HPA-axis activation and possibly a co-activation of both branches of the autonomic nervous system characterize task-related flow experience.",doi,10.1016/j.jesp.2014.01.009,nagy2015,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,"Peifer, C., Schulz, A., Schächinger, H., Baumann, N., Antoni, C.

,The Reverse Monte Carlo Localization Algorithm,"Global localization is a very fundamental and challenging problem in Robotic Soccer. Here, the main aim is to find the best method which is very robust and fast and requires less computational resources and memory compared to similar approaches and is precise enough for robot soccer games and technical challenges. In this work, the Reverse Monte Carlo localization (R-MCL) method is introduced. The algorithm is designed for fast, precise and robust global localization of autonomous robots in the robotic soccer domain, to overcome the uncertainties in the sensors, environment and the motion model. R-MCL is a hybrid method based on Markov localization (ML) and Monte Carlo localization (MCL), where the ML based module finds the region where the robot should be and the MCL based part predicts the geometrical location with high precision by selecting samples in this region. It is called Reverse since the MCL routine is applied in a reverse manner in this algorithm. In this work, this method is tested on a challenging data set that is used by many other researchers and compared in terms of error rate against different levels of noise, and sparsity. Additionally, the time required to recover from kidnapping and the processing time of the methods are tested and compared. According to the test results R-MCL is a considerable method against high sparsity and noise. It is preferable when its recovery from kidnapping and processing times are considered. It gives robust and fast but relatively coarse position estimations against imprecise and inadequate perceptions, and coarse action data, including regular misplacements, and false perceptions. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

,"The Role Of Computer Games In Measuring Spirometry In Healthy And ""Asthmatic"" Preschool Children","Study objectives: To explore the role of respiratory interactive computer games in teaching spirometry to preschool children, and to examine whether the spirometry data achieved are compatible with acceptable criteria for adults and with published data for healthy preschool children, and whether spirometry at this age can assess airway obstruction. Design: Feasibility study. Settings: Community kindergartens around Israel and a tertiary pediatric pulmonary clinic. Participants: Healthy and asthmatic preschool children (age range, 2.0 to 6.5 years). Intervention: Multitarget interactive spirometry games including three targets: full inspiration before expiration, instant forced expiration, and long expiration to residual volume. Measurements and results: One hundred nine healthy and 157 asthmatic children succeeded in performing adequate spirometry using a multitarget interactive spirometry game. American Thoracic Society (ATS)/European Respiratory Society spirometry criteria for adults for the start of the test, and repeatability were met. Expiration time increased with age (1.3 ± 0.3 s at 3 years to 1.9 ± 0.3 s at 6 years [± SD], p &lt; 0.05). FVC and flow rates increased with age, while FEV1/FVC decreased. Healthy children had FVC and FEV1 values similar to those of previous preschool studies, but flows were significantly higher (&gt; 1.5 SD for forced expiratory flow at 50% of vital capacity [FEF50] and forced expiratory flow at 75% of vital capacity [FEF75], p &lt; 0.005). The descending part of the flow/volume curve was convex in 2.5- to 3.5-year-old patients, resembling that of infants, while in 5- to 6-year-old patients, there was linear decay. Asthma severity by Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines correlated with longer expiration time (1.7 ± 0.4 s; p &lt; 0.03) and lower FEF50 (32 to 63%; p &lt; 0.001) compared to healthy children. Bronchodilators improved FEV1 by 10 to 13% and FEF50 by 38 to 56% of baseline. Conclusions: Interactive respiratory games can facilitate spirometry in very young children, yielding results that conform to most of the ATS criteria established for adults and published data for healthy preschool children.

,The Social Perceptual Salience Effect,"Affective processes appraise the salience of external stimuli preparing the agent for action. So far, the relationship between stimuli, affect, and action has been mainly studied in highly controlled laboratory conditions. In order to find the generalization of this relationship to social interaction, we assess the influence of the salience of social stimuli on human interaction. We constructed reality ball game in a mixed reality space where pairs of people collaborated in order to compete with an opposing team. We coupled the players with team members with varying social salience by using both physical and virtual representations of remote players (i.e., avatars). We observe that, irrespective of the team composition, winners and losers display significantly different inter- and intrateam spatial behaviors. We show that subjects regulate their interpersonal distance to both virtual and physical team members in similar ways, but in proportion to the vividness of the stimulus. As an independent validation of this social salience effect, we show that this behavioral effect is also displayed in physiological correlates of arousal. In addition, we found a strong correlation between performance, physiology, and the subjective reports of the subjects. Our results show that proxemics is consistent with affective responses, confirming the existence of a social salience effect. This provides further support for the so-called law of apparent reality, and it generalizes it to the social realm, where it can be used to design more efficient social artifacts. © 2012 American Psychological Association.",doi,10.1037/a0028317,Scopus,Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance,"Inderbitzin M.P., Betella A., Lanatá A., Scilingo E.P., Bernardet U., Verschure P.F.M.J.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,The Specificity Of Rugby Union Training Sessions In Preparation For Match Demands.,"Investigations into the specificity of rugby union training practices in preparation for competitive demands has predominantly focussed on physical and physiological demands. The evaluation of the contextual variance in perceptual strain or skill requirements between training and matches in rugby union is unclear, yet holistic understanding may assist to optimise training design. This study evaluated the specificity of physical, physiological, perceptual and skill demands of training sessions compared with competitive match-play in pre-professional, elite club rugby union. Global positioning system (GPS) devices, video capture, heart rate (HR), and session ratings of perceived exertion (sRPE) were used to assess movement patterns, skill completions, physiologic, and perceptual responses, respectively. Data were collected across a season (training sessions n=29; matches n=14). Participants (n=32) were grouped in playing positions as: outside backs, centres, halves, loose forwards, lock forwards, and front row forwards. Greater total distance, low-intensity activity, maximal speed and metres per min were apparent in matches compared to training in all positions (P<0.02; d>0.90). Similarly, match HR, and sRPE responses were higher than those recorded in training (P<0.05; d>0.8). Key skill completions for forwards (i.e., scrums, rucks and lineouts) and backs (i.e., kicks) were greater under match conditions than in training (P<0.001; d>1.50). Considerable disparities exist between the perceptual, physiological, and key skill demands of competitive matches versus training sessions in pre-professional rugby union players. Practitioners should consider the specificity of training tasks for pre-professional rugby players to ensure the best preparation for match demands.",doi,10.1123/ijspp.2017-0082,pubmed,International journal of sports physiology and performance,"Campbell, Patrick G; Peake, Jonathan M; Minett, Geoffrey M",2017,NA,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,"The Value Of Art In Bioshock: Ayn Rand, Emotion, And Choice","BioShock made a big splash not only for the depth of its subject matter, but also for the way it utilized its video game medium to present its big ideas in a uniquely engaging way. The game weaves many themes into its complicated narrative, complete with shifting identities, science fiction superpowers, and survival-horror overtones. It is clear that BioShock wants to be taken as a spiritual sequel to Rand's philosophical novel Atlas Shrugged, revealing a possible fate for John Galt's mysterious hidden utopia, sought after for much of the novel but never fully revealed, as the book ends just before Galt discloses his society and its plans for the world. Rand develops her philosophy through fiction because she defines art as a selective re-creation of reality according to an artist's perspective. That is, a work of art is an artist's take on what it is to be human. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.All rights reserved.",doi,10.1002/9781118915899.ch2,Scopus,"BioShock and Philosophy: Irrational Game, Rational Book",Rose J.,2015,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Time Spent On The Internet And Adolescent Blood Pressure,"Internet use is nearly ubiquitous among adolescents. Growing evidence suggests heavy Internet use negatively impacts health, yet the relationship between time spent on the Internet and adolescent blood pressure (BP) is unknown. We examined the association between Internet use and elevated BP in a racially diverse cross-sectional sample of 331 healthy adolescents (ages 14-17 years). Heavy Internet use was defined as ≥ 2 hr/day, moderate use as <2 hr/day and ≥ 5 days/week, and light use as <2 hr/day and ≤ 4 days/week. Elevated BP was defined as systolic or diastolic BP ≥ 90th percentile. Heavy Internet users had statistically significantly higher odds of elevated BP compared to light Internet users. School nurses can play an important role in preventing high BP through assessment of BP and other health behaviors including Internet use, and health teaching to individuals, student groups, faculty, and parents to increase awareness of the relationship between Internet use and health. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014.",doi,10.1177/1059840514556772,Scopus,Journal of School Nursing,"Cassidy-Bushrow A.E., Johnson D.A., Peters R.M., Burmeister C., Joseph C.L.M.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Toward A Comprehensive Theoretical Framework For Designing Digital Badges,"Digital badges, as emerging trend in education technology, present a new means of assessment in the form of granular microcredentials. The problem facing educators is that distributed learning across various domains and contexts is not captured or structured effectively. This chapter will attempt develop a framework for designing digital badge systems to help address this issue. The authors first present a range of related theories that could support the design of digital badges, including enabling learning autonomy and personalization from the self-regulated learning perspective, goal setting, and pertinent motivating factors found in digital games. The culmination of these theories is then presented as a comprehensive framework which, in turn, could possibly lay the foundation for the design and implementation of digital badge systems. © 2016 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",doi,10.1007/978-3-319-15425-1_14,Scopus,Foundation of Digital Badges and Micro-Credentials: Demonstrating and Recognizing Knowledge and Competencies,"Wills C., Xie Y.",2016,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Towards A Trajectory Planning Concept: Augmenting Path Planning Methods By Considering Speed Limit Constraints,"Trajectory planning is an essential part of systems controlling autonomous entities such as vehicles or robots. It requires not only finding spatial curves but also that dynamic properties of the vehicles (such as speed limits for certain maneuvers) must be followed. In this paper, we present an approach for augmenting existing path planning methods to support basic dynamic constraints, concretely speed limit constraints. We apply this approach to the well known Astate-of-the-art ThetaLazy Thetapath planning algorithms. We use a concept of trajectory planning based on a modular architecture in which spatial and dynamic parts can be easily implemented. This concept allows dynamic aspects to be processed during planning. Existing systems based on a similar concept usually add dynamics (velocity) into spatial curves in a post-processing step which might be inappropriate when the curves do not follow the dynamics. Many existing trajectory planning approaches, especially in mobile robotics, encode dynamic aspects directly in the representation (e.g. in the form of regular lattices) which requires a precise knowledge of the environmental and dynamic properties of particular autonomous entities making designing and implementing such trajectory planning approaches quite difficult. The concept of trajectory planning we implemented might not be as precise but the modular architecture makes the design and implementation easier because we can use (modified) well known path planning methods and define models of dynamics of autonomous entities separately. This seems to be appropriate for simulations used in feasibility studies for some complex autonomous systems or in computer games etc. Our basic implementation of the augmented A, ThetaLazy Thetaalgorithms is also experimentally evaluated. We compare (i) the augmented and basic A, ThetaLazy Thetaalgorithms and (ii) optimizing of augmented ThetaLazy Thetafor distance (the trajectory length) and duration (time needed to move through the trajectory). © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",doi,10.1007/s10846-013-9886-7,Scopus,Journal of Intelligent and Robotic Systems: Theory and Applications,"Chrpa L., Osborne H.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Training Inspiratoryresistance In Duchenne Dystrophy Using Adapted Computer Games,"Computer games were modified to encourage respiratory effort by two groups of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. One group trained during the first six months of the study, the other during the second six months. Inspiratory effort was increased by their having to breathe through a mask to both start and continue the games. Pulmonary function tests were done at the beginning of the trial and six, 12 and 18 months later, when forced vital capacity, respiratory muscle endurance and strength were measured. Although there were some individual improvements, over‐all the results were not statistically significant. Entrainement á la resistance inspiratoire chez les myopathes de Duchenne, par jeux d'ordinateur adaptés Des jeux d'ordinateur ont été modifies pour encourager l'effort respiratoire dans deux groupes de myopathes de Duchenne. Un groupe fut entrainé durant les six premiers mois de l'étude, l'autre durant les seconds six mois. L'effort inspiratoire fut accru par une respiration à travers un masque, pour débuter et poursuivre les jeux. Les tests de fonction pulmonaire furent effectués au début de l'apprentissage et six, 12 et 18 mois plus tard, comprenant la capacité vitale maximale, 1'endurance des muscles respiratoires et leur force. Bien qu'il y ait eu quelques améliorations individuelles, les résultats globaux ne furent pas statistiquement significatifs. Training der inspiratorischen Resistenz bei Patienten mit Duchenne'scher Muskeldystrophie unter Verwendung von dafiir entwickelten Computerspielen Mit Hilfe von modifizierten Computerspielen wurde bei zwei Gruppen von Patienten mit Duchenne'scher Muskeldystrophie versucht, die Atemanstrengungen zu fördern. Eine Gruppe trainierte während der ersten sechs Monate der Studie und die andere während der zweiten sechs Monate. Die inspiratorischen Anstrengungen wurden dadurch erhöht, daß sie durch eine Maske atmen mußten, um die Spiele zu starten und zu spielen. Die Lungenfunktionstests wurden zu Beginn der Untersuchung und sechs, 12 und 18 Monate später, als auch die forcierte Vitalkapazität, die Atemmuskelausdauer und‐stärke gemessen wurden, durchgeführt. Obwohl einige individuelle Verbesserungen verzeichnet werden konnten, waren die Ergebnisse nicht statistisch signifikant.

,Transfer Of Heart Rate Feedback Training To Reduce Heart Rate Response To Laboratory Tasks,"To examine whether transfer of heart rate (HR) feedback training to tasks not used during training could be improved by using multiple tasks during training, a modified multiple baseline across tasks, single subject design study was conducted using six high HR-reactive young adults. Participants received HR feedback training during the presentation of a videogame, and transfer of training was assessed to a mental arithmetic challenge and handgrip task. Transfer of training was next assessed following training with the mental arithmetic challenge and handgrip task. HR responses to each training task with no HR feedback were assessed during a pre-treatment session, an immediate post-training period following training on each task, a short delay (1-2 days) post-training session, and a long delay (1-2 weeks) post-training session. HR response to a novel speech task was assessed at pre-treatment and during short delay and long delay post-training sessions. Results revealed that participants reduced HR during training and generally maintained this reduction in HR during the immediate post-training assessment when HR feedback was not present. Participants were not able to reduce HR responses to tasks during short delay and long delay post-training sessions, and they were unable to transfer HR reduction skills to the speech task. Transfer of HR feedback training to new tasks was limited in nature and efforts to train across multiple stressors did not appear to improve transfer of training. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.",doi,10.1007/s10484-006-9011-9,Scopus,Applied Psychophysiology Biofeedback,"Goodie J.L., Larkin K.T.",2006,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,"Trouble In Paradise: Resilience And Vancouvers Second Life In The ""New Economy""","Resilience is an increasingly important concept within urban studies, economic geography, and evolutionary economics for measuring the capacity of city-regions to respond to economic shocks. In this article, we provide a sympathetic critique of the resilience metaphor in urban studies, which we explicate through an analysis of the recent history of the Vancouver economy. On the surface, Vancouver seemingly showed resilience when it overcame the abrupt decline of its resource-based economy in the 1980s, and established an alternative flourishing ""new economy"" by the 1990s. But over the last five years, the key local ""creative"" industries such as video game development and film production have suffered, with a number of large firms leaving Vancouver, and industry employment declining sharply. Drawing on more than 40 interviews conducted over a five-year period with members of the local video game community, our paper documents the rise and more recent decline of Vancouvers ""new economy"" sector. Our research raises questions about the value of the resilience metaphor in urban studies and highlights the difficulties facing city-regions reliant on highly mobile ""new economy"" industries. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",doi,10.1080/02723638.2015.1068526,Scopus,Urban Geography,"Siemiatycki E., Hutton T., Barnes T.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Tv Programs That Denounce Unfair Advantage Impact Women's Sensitivity To Defection In The Public Goods Game,"We explore the neural underpinnings of gender differences in cooperation and their modulation by intensive media watching. We compared cooperative decisions and electroencephalograph data between genders from who participated in repeated rounds of the public goods game (PGG) and investigated within groups changes that occurred after watching a TV program known as ""investigative reporting"" that denounces unfair advantages taken by free-riders against the public. Women tended to be more cooperative than men during early rounds of PGG, mostly because they react differently to the defection of others; women also had greater β and γ band activity in regions estimated to be associated with social cognition. These gender differences disappeared after participants watched the TV programs: women were more likely to choose free-riding in response to the defection of others that elicits significant increases in γ band activities that were estimated to be right insula. Greater activity in social cognition leads women to make decisions considering the motives of others, while men tend to make a decision by complying with the social norm. Watching the investigative TV reports produced a greater negative emotion to the defection and led women, in a similar manner as men, to opt for a ""tit-for-tat"" strategy. © 2013 © Taylor & Francis.",doi,10.1080/17470919.2013.835280,Scopus,Social Neuroscience,"Park S.A., Jeong S., Jeong J.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Type-Specific Screen Time Associations With Cardiovascular Risk Markers In Children,"Background: There is evidence that TV time may have stronger associations with cardiovascular risk markers than other types of screen time, but most studies focus on TV, or total screen time. Purpose: To examine associations between types of screen time and cardiovascular risk markers in school-age children. Methods: Cross-sectional study of 2515 school children in Portugal (aged 2-12 years, data collected in 2009 and 2010). Three types of screen time (TV, electronic games, and PC time) were collected through a questionnaire, and data on three cardiovascular risk markers (resting heart rate; diastolic blood pressure [DBP]; and systolic blood pressure [SBP]) were collected by a trained fieldworker. Complex-samples generalized linear models were run for each combination of screen time predictor and cardiovascular risk outcome, and a clustered cardiovascular risk score, adjusting for potential confounders (including physical activity). Analyses were conducted in 2011 and 2012. Results: TV viewing, but not PC or electronic games time, was associated positively with clustered cardiovascular risk score, DBP, and SBP after adjustment for all covariates. Watching TV for >2 hours/day (compared to <1 hour/day) was associated with higher DBP (coefficient, logged and back-transformed 0.02, 95% CI=0.00, 0.04, linear trend p=0.003); SBP (logged and back-transformed 0.02, 95% CI= -0.01, 0.05, p=0.009), and clustered cardiovascular risk score (0.13, 95% CI=0.02, 0.24, p<0.001). Conclusions: TV viewing, but no other type of screen time, was associated positively with cardiovascular risk markers independently of physical activity. Studies using a single marker of screen time or sedentary behavior may conceal screen time type-specific associations. © 2013 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.",doi,10.1016/j.amepre.2013.01.020,Scopus,American Journal of Preventive Medicine,"Stamatakis E., Coombs N., Jago R., Gama A., Mourão I., Nogueira H., Rosado V., Padez C.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas

,Urinary Prostasin: A Possible Biomarker For Renal Pressure Natriuresis In Black Adolescents,"Prostasin is a membrane-bound/secretive serine protease interacting with aldosterone and the epithelial sodium channel in the kidney. We and others have previously proposed the concept of stress-induced pressure natriuresis (SIPN) where increased urinary sodium excretion (UNaV) is coupled with elevated blood pressure (BP) in response to behavioral stress in normotensive adolescents. This study thus aimed to test the relationship between prostasin and pressure natriuresis using the SIPN model. A cohort of 102 normotensive black adolescents (mean age: 17.0 ± 1.2 y; 56% females) were placed on a controlled sodium (4000 ± 200 mg/d) and potassium (2600 ± 200 mg/d) diet for three days before testing. The SIPN protocol consisted of a 1-h baseline period, a 1-h stress period (competitive video game), and a 1-h recovery period. During the stress period, BP elevation was coupled with an increase in UNaV. Urinary prostasin concentration had more than a 2-fold reduction from baseline (38.4 ± 32.7 ng/mL) to stress (17.2 ± 16.0 ng/mL), and further declined during recovery (12.1 ± 16.2 ng/mL) (p < 0.001). Urinary prostasin was inversely correlated with UNaV during stress (r = -0.43, p = 0.0001), even after being normalized by urinary creatinine. Our data suggest that urinary prostasin could be a novel biomarker and/or mechanism for renal pressure natriuresis in normotensive black adolescents. © International Pediatrics Research Foundation, Inc. 2009.

,Use Of Respiratory Biofeedback And Claws For Increased Navigator Efficiency For Imaging The Thoracic Aorta,"A novel technique to guide a subjects' breathing pattern using a respiratory biofeedback (rBF) ""game"" to improve respiratory efficiency is presented. The continuously adaptive windowing strategy, a fully automatic and highly efficient free-breathing navigator gated technique, is used to acquire the data as it ensures that all potential navigator acceptance windows are possible. This enables the rBF to be fully adaptable to a subject's respiratory pattern. Images of the thoracic aorta acquired using balanced steady-state free precession with continuously adaptive windowing strategy respiratory motion control, with and without rBF, were compared in 10 healthy subjects. Total scan time was reduced by using rBF. The mean scan time was reduced from 7 min 44 s (463 cardiac cycles, ±127cc) without rBF to 5 min 43 s (380 cardiac cycles, ±118cc) with the use of rBF (P < 0.05). Respiratory efficiency was increased from 45% without rBF to 56% with rBF (P < 0.01). Image quality was the same for both techniques (P = ns). In conclusion, rBF significantly improved respiratory efficiency and reduced acquisition duration without affecting image quality.

,User-Centred Design And Usability Evaluation Of A Heart Rate Variability Biofeedback Game,"Reduced heart rate variability (HRV) is an indicator of a malfunctioning autonomic nervous system. Resonant frequency breathing is a potential non-invasive means of intervention for improving the balance of the autonomic nervous system and increasing HRV. However, such breathing exercises are regarded as boring and monotonous tasks. The use of gaming elements (gamification) or a full gaming experience is a well-recognised method for achieving higher motivation and engagement in various tasks. However, there is limited documented knowledge on how to design a game for breathing exercises. In particular, the influence of additional interactive elements on the main course of training has not yet been explored. In this paper, we evaluated the satisfaction levels achieved using different game elements and how disruptive they were to the main task, i.e., paced breathing training. An Android flight game was developed with three game modes that differ in the degrees of multitasking they require. Design, development, and evaluation were conducted using a user-centred approach, including context analysis, the design of game principle mock-ups, the selection of game principles through a survey, the design of the game mechanics and GUI mock-up, and icon testing, and the performance of a summative study through user questionnaires and interviews. A summative evaluation of the developed game was performed with 11 healthy participants (ages 40-67) in a controlled setting. The results confirm the potential of video games for motivating players to engage in HRV biofeedback training. The highest training performance on the first try was achieved through pure visualisation rather than in a multitasking mode. Players had higher motivation to play the more challenging game and were more interested in long-term engagement. A framework for gamified HRV biofeedback research is presented. It has been shown that multitasking has considerable influence on HRV biofeedback and should be used with an adaptive challenge level. © 2013 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2601882,Scopus,IEEE Access,"Wollmann T., Abtahi F., Eghdam A., Seoane F., Lindecrantz K., Haag M., Koch S.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,User Selfishness Vs. File Availability In P2p File-Sharing Systems: Evolutionary Game Theoretic Approach,"In a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) file-sharing system, a node finds and retrieves its desired file. If multiple nodes cache the same file to provide others, we can achieve a dependable file-sharing system with low latency and high file availability. However, a node has to spend costs, e. g., processing load or storage capacity, on caching a file. Consequently, a node may selfishly behave and hesitate to cache a file. In such a case, unpopular files are likely to disappear from the system. In this paper, we aim to reveal whether effective caching in the whole system emerges from autonomous and selfish node behavior. We discuss relationship between selfish node behavior and system dynamics by using evolutionary game theory. Through theoretic analysis, we show that a file-sharing system can be robust to file disappearance depending on a cost and demand model for caching even if nodes behave selfishly. Furthermore, we also conduct several simulation-based analysis in terms of network structures, evolving network, load balancing, and system stability. As a result, we demonstrate that a file-sharing system with good properties, i.e., robustness to file disappearance, low search latency, well load-balancing, and high stability, can be achieved independent of network structures and dynamics. © Springer Science + Business Media, LLC 2009.",doi,10.1007/s12083-009-0045-7,Scopus,Peer-to-Peer Networking and Applications,"Sasabe M., Wakamiya N., Murata M.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas

,Using Cognitive Dissonance To Induce Adolescents' Escaping From The Claw Of Online Gaming: The Roles Of Personal Responsibility And Justification Of Cost,"The negative impact of the Internet on adolescents has received much attention. How to reduce their pathological use of online gaming is also a critical issue. Based on cognitive dissonance theory, two experiments were conducted to examine whether personal responsibility and justification of cost may play crucial factors in impacting adolescent players' attitude change and their willingness to engage in attitude-discrepant behavior. The results of Experiment 1 revealed that adolescent players who felt a strong sense of responsibility appeared to exhibit greater attitude change. In Experiment 2, the findings indicated that players tended to employ justification of cost in order to reduce or eliminate the dissonance between their attitude toward online gaming and invested cost. Adolescent players who perceived a higher cost in online gaming were less willing to engage in attitude-discrepant behavior. Reducing adolescents ' overuse of online gaming can be appreciated through the perspective of cognitive dissonance. © 2007 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",doi,10.1089/cpb.2007.9972,Scopus,Cyberpsychology and Behavior,"Chiou W.-B., Wan C.-S.",2007,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Using Embodied Conversational Agents In Video Games To Investigate Emotional Facial Expressions,"The perception of emotional facial expressions has been diligently studied in psychology for the last 40. years. The stimuli mainly used in these studies were photos or short film clips. Today, video games and their development frameworks allow researchers to design, model, and animate embodied conversational agents (ECAs). This research paper introduces an experimental setting to observe and measure the perception of facial expression performed by embodied conversational agents. The experimental setup is based on the research efforts of the psychologist Harald G. Wallbott and uses the CryENGINE to visualize the ECAs in various contextual settings. A new paradigm, coined "" Interaction-Paradigm"" , is integrated in the experimental setting, which is derived from the video-games domain. It utilizes the benefits of video games as a research tool: the setup grants participants an interactive experience of a given emotional situation, which allows the investigation of the perception process in a more realistic setting. In contrast to the traditional approaches in emotion theory research, the usage of video games ensures that situational aspects are not presented by simply showing subjects a piece of paper containing descriptions of a situation.Based on an extensive state of the art on using video games and games development frameworks in research, this article shows how to set up experiments using video game technology. The aim of the study is to establish a comparative experimental framework to analyze subjects' judgment on emotional stimuli in different context dimensions. The findings show that the importance of information channels changes, when people decide for the emotional quality of a situation. While in still images the majority of people bases the decision on the facial expression, rather than based on the text description, in interactive scenarios only 11.8% of the participants relied on the facial expressions, with the majority using the contextual description. We present the results of the experiment in detail and summarize how video games and games development frameworks can support research in the area of ECAs and emotion perception. © 2011 International Federation for Information Processing.",doi,10.1016/j.entcom.2011.03.007,Scopus,Entertainment Computing,"Lankes M., Bernhaupt R.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Valence Weighting As A Predictor Of Emotional Reactivity To A Stressful Situation,"Individuals who have a more adverse reaction to stressful situations are at heightened risk for developing emotional disorders. The current studies aimed to demonstrate that valence biases in attitude generalization relate to individuals' emotional reactivity following a stressful task. Participants played a computer game in which they had to learn whether previously unknown stimuli (i.e., beans) produced positive or negative outcomes. They then had to classify novel stimuli, which varied in resemblance to those employed in the game, as either positive or negative. Attitude generalization, i.e., the extent to which participants weight resemblance to a positive versus negative, is critical to the classification of these novel stimuli, which provided the basis for indexing valence weighting. Participants then completed a stressful anagram task, in which they had three minutes to solve as many anagrams as possible. Half the anagrams were difficult, and half were insoluble, thus creating a failure experience. Mood was assessed before and after the task as a measure of emotional reactivity. In two studies, we observed that for participants initially in a good mood, the extent to which negative attitudes generalized more extensively than positive attitudes was predictive of greater emotional reactivity to the stressful anagram task. © 2012 Guilford Publications, Inc.",doi,10.1521/jscp.2012.31.7.746,Scopus,Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology,"Pietri E.S., Fazio R.H., Shook N.J.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Ventricular Fibrillation Refractory To Icd Therapy,"A 14-year-old boy was admitted for the evaluation of recurrent syncope. His ECG on admission revealed a sinus rhythm with an undetermined QRS axis, T wave inversion at leads V3, V4 and abnormal q at leads I, aVL, V5, and V6. However, no underlying disease could be detected by any morphological examination. Programmed ventricular stimulation also induced no ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation (VF). Only signal-averaged ECG showed ventricular late potential and the cause of syncope was not clarified. As his brother with a similar ECG had died suddenly, he was prophylactically treated with an ICD. However, 14 months later he died suddenly after playing a video game.

,Vestibular Rehabilitation Using The Nintendo® Wii Balance Board - A User-Friendly Alternative For Central Nervous Compensation,"Conclusion: The Nintendo® Wii Balance Board is a cost-effective and user-friendly alternative to other popular frequently used systems that aid vestibular compensation, particularly in elderly patients. In addition, further treatment in the home environment is possible. Objective: This cohort study was designed to investigate the impact of the Nintendo® Wii Balance Board as a visual compensation device after acute vestibular neuritis. Methods: Subjects were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups. Group A (n = 37) performed customized exercises with the Nintendo® Wii Balance Board. Group B (n = 34) performed only two elected exercises as a control group for comparison of the results. Both groups underwent additive therapy with steroids (intravenous) in decreasing doses (250 mg decreasing to 25 mg over 10 days). The Sensory Organization Test (SOT), Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI), Vertigo Symptom Scale (VSS), and Tinneti questionnaire were evaluated immediately before treatment (baseline), at the end of treatment, i.e. at day 5, and after 10 weeks. Results: The early use of a visual feedback system in the context of the balance training supports the central nervous vestibular compensation after peripheral labyrinthine disorders. Patients in group B (without training) required a longer in-patient stay (average 2.4 days, SD 0.4) compared with patients following early Wii rehabilitation. The absence of nystagmus under Frenzel's goggles in group A was observed 2.1 days (SD 0.5) earlier than in group B. Group A showed significantly better results in the SOT, DHI, VSS, and Tinneti questionnaire at all time points measured (p < 0.05). © 2013 Informa Healthcare.",doi,10.3109/00016489.2012.732707,Scopus,Acta Oto-Laryngologica,"Sparrer I., Duong Dinh T.A., Ilgner J., Westhofen M.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,"Video-Mediated And Co-Present Gameplay: Effects Of Mutual Gaze On Game Experience, Expressiveness And Perceived Social Presence","We study how pairs of children interact socially and express their emotions while playing games in different communicative settings. In particular, we study how such interactions can vary for environments that differ regarding the level of mediation and the associated feelings of social presence. Overall, the study compared three conditions (one face-to-face gameplay condition, and two video-mediated gameplay conditions; one allowing for mutual gaze, the other not) and focused on the social presence and non-verbal behavior of children in three conditions. The results show that the presence of mutual eye-gaze enriches the feelings of social presence, fun and game experience; conversely, the absence of mutual eye-gaze dramatically effects the quality of interaction in the video-mediated environment. The results of this study stress the importance of mutual gaze, and we therefore argue that it should become an integral component of future VMC systems, particularly in those designed for playful settings and children. © 2012 British Informatics Society Limited.

,"Video Game Addiction: Cognitive, Emotional, And Behavioral Determinants For Cbt Treatment [Addiction Aux Jeux Vidéo : Déterminants Cognitifs, Émotionnels Et Comportementaux Pour Une Tcc]","During the last decade, the literature concerning Video Game Addiction (VGA) has grown strongly. Several studies deal with motivational aspects of VGA. However, there is a lack of qualitative studies allowing us to describe various emotions, cognitions and behaviors related to video game playing in this type of research. The purpose of the present research is to operationalize emotions, cognitions and behaviors proposed in a previous study with a protocol that permits to address VGA in a panel of various video game players. For this purpose, the Assessment of Cognitions, Emotions, and Behaviors Involved in Gaming (ACEBIG) was created. The findings were discussed in the context of a CBT intervention for VGA. Excessive Gamers (EG) presented more negative emotions and negative physical manifestations. The excitement and expectations about excitement were higher in EG group. EG presented more expectations about self-worth. When losing, self-devaluation and coping strategies dealing with negative emotions was highlighted. This research emphasizes the importance of cognitive avoidance of reality and immersion into the game. EG reported more expectations about social relationships through the game and more challenge related to other players. Interesting findings concerned behaviors (e.g., preparatory behaviors for improving gaming experience). The results of this research provide evidences that VGA is close to addictive behaviors and lead to some clinical implications. © 2017 Association Française de Therapie Comportementale et Cognitive",doi,10.1016/j.jtcc.2017.06.005,Scopus,Journal de Therapie Comportementale et Cognitive,"Taquet P., Romo L., Cottencin O., Ortiz D., Hautekeete M.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas

Studies 1 and 2 suggest that females experience greater presence and more aggressive thoughts from game play when a gender match between self and game character exists. Studies 2 and 3 indicate that playing against a human opponent (rather than a computer) increases aggressive thoughts.

,Video Games And The Political And Cultural Economies Of Health-Entertainment,"Focusing mainly on the company Nintendo, this paper examines the political economic and cultural forces underpinning the video game industry’s recent interest in merging entertainment and health promotion. This is a trend best exemplified in sexagenarian actress Helen Mirren’s endorsement of Nintendo’s fitness-themed game Wii Fit Plus. In one sense, ‘health-entertainment’ is deemed a product of the coercive laws of competition that impress the need for reinvestment and innovation as a way of warding off industry rivals. Nintendo’s turn to health promotion is from this perspective an extension of the ‘console wars’ that in the past drove gaming companies to pursue verisimilitude on screen in hopes of attracting (young male) consumers. In another sense, the present moment offers an ideal time to direct innovation towards the issues of health and healthy ageing in particular, as the cultural logics of healthism and the ‘third age’ both emphasise the virtues of ‘healthy’ and autonomous consumer activity. As such, Nintendo has pursued aesthetic simplicity but kinaesthetic realism as a way of extending the appeal of video gaming beyond the male youth demographic. In examining the implications of these developments, it is argued that health and entertainment, as independent constructs, are conceptually reimagined through their integration with one another. The pursuit of entertainment is made ‘responsible’, thereby remedying the concern that video gaming is an unhealthy activity. The pursuit of health, meanwhile, becomes a matter of playful, technology-enhanced and ultimately consumption-based experience. © 2014 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",doi,10.1080/02614367.2014.986511,Scopus,Leisure Studies,Millington B.,2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Video Material And Epilepsy,"Summary: Nine patients who had epileptic attacks while playing computer games were studied in the laboratory. Patients had an EEG recorded as well as their response to intermittent photic stimulation (IPS) at flash rates of 1–60 fps. In addition, pattern sensitivity was assessed in all patients by a gratings pattern. Only 2 patients had no previous history of convulsions, and only 2 had a normal basic EEG. All but 1 were sensitive to IPS, and all but 1 were pattern sensitive. Most patients were male, but although this appears to conflict with previously published literature results regarding the sex ratio in photosensitivity, it was due to the male predominance of video game usage. We compared our results with those reported in the literature. Diagnosing video game epilepsy requires performing an EEG with IPS and pattern stimulation. We propose a standard method of testing.

,"Violence Exposure In Real Life, Video Games, Television, Movies, And The Internet: Is There Desensitization?","It is believed that repeated exposure to real-life and to entertainment violence may alter cognitive, affective, and behavioral processes, possibly leading to desensitization. The goal of the present study was to determine if there are relationships between real-life and media violence exposure and desensitization as reflected in related characteristics. One hundred fifty fourth and fifth graders completed measures of real-life violence exposure, media violence exposure, empathy, and attitudes towards violence. Regression analyses indicated that only exposure to video game violence was associated with (lower) empathy. Both video game and movie violence exposure were associated with stronger proviolence attitudes. The active nature of playing video games, intense engagement, and the tendency to be translated into fantasy play may explain negative impact, though causality was not investigated in the present design. The samples’ relatively low exposure to real-life violence may have limited the identification of relationships. Although difficult to quantify, desensitization to violence should be further studied using related characteristics as in the present study. Individual differences and causal relationships should also be examined",doi,10.1016/j.adolescence.2003.10.005,anderson2010,Journal of Adolescence,"Funk, J. B., Baldacci, H.

,Violent And Nonviolent Video Games Differentially Affect Physical Aggression For Individuals High Vs. Low In Dispositional Anger,"Although numerous experiments have shown that exposure to violent video games (VVG) causes increases in aggression, relatively few studies have investigated the extent to which this effect differs as a function of theoretically relevant individual difference factors. This study investigated whether video game content differentially influences aggression as a function of individual differences in trait anger. Participants were randomly assigned to play a violent or nonviolent video game before completing a task in which they could behave aggressively. Results showed that participants high in trait anger were the most aggressive, but only if they first played a VVG. This relationship held while statistically controlling for dimensions other than violent content on which game conditions differed (e.g. frustration, arousal). Implications of these findings for models explaining the effects of video games on behavior are discussed. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",doi,10.1002/ab.20411,Scopus,Aggressive Behavior,"Engelhardt C.R., Bartholow B.D., Saults J.S.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,"Violent Video Game Effects On Aggression, Empathy, And Prosocial Behavior In Eastern And Western Countries: A Meta-Analytic Review","Meta-analytic procedures were used to test the effects of violent video games on aggressive behavior, aggressive cognition, aggressive affect, physiological arousal, empathy/desensitization, and prosocial behavior. Unique features of this meta-analytic review include (a) more restrictive methodological quality inclusion criteria than in past meta-analyses; (b) cross-cultural comparisons; (c) longitudinal studies for all outcomes except physiological arousal; (d) conservative statistical controls; (e) multiple moderator analyses; and (f) sensitivity analyses. Social-cognitive models and cultural differences between Japan and Western countries were used to generate theory-based predictions. Meta-analyses yielded significant effects for all 6 outcome variables. The pattern of results for different outcomes and research designs (experimental, cross-sectional, longitudinal) fit theoretical predictions well. The evidence strongly suggests that exposure to violent video games is a causal risk factor for increased aggressive behavior, aggressive cognition, and aggressive affect and for decreased empathy and prosocial behavior. Moderator analyses revealed significant research design effects, weak evidence of cultural differences in susceptibility and type of measurement effects, and no evidence of sex differences in susceptibility.

This article reports an experiment designed to test key hypotheses concerning the short term impact of exposure to violent video games on young women, a population that has received relatively little attention in this research literature. Results were that brief exposure to a violent video game increased aggressive behavior.

,Violent Video Games As Exemplary Teachers: A Conceptual Analysis.,"This article presents conceptual and empirical analyses of several of the “best practices” of learning and instruction, and demonstrates how violent video games use them effectively to motivate learners to persevere in acquiring and mastering a number of skills, to navigate through complex problems and changing environments, and to experiment with different identities until success is achieved. These educational principles allow for the generation of several testable hypotheses, two of which are tested with samples of 430 elementary school children (mean age 10 years), 607 young adolescents (mean age 14 years), and 1,441 older adolescents (mean age 19 years). Participants were surveyed about their video game habits and their aggressive cognitions and behaviors. The first hypothesis is based on the principle that curricula that teach the same underlying concepts across contexts should have the highest transfer. Therefore, students who play multiple violent video games should be more likely to learn aggressive cognitions and behaviors than those who play fewer. The second hypothesis is based on the principle that long-term learning is improved the more practice is distributed across time. Therefore, students who play violent video games more frequently across time should be more likely to learn aggressive cognitions and behaviors than those who play the same types of games for equivalent amounts of time but less frequently. Both hypotheses were supported. We conclude by describing what educators can learn from the successful instructional and curriculum design features of video games.",doi,10.1007/s10964-007-9206-2,anderson2010,Journal of Youth and Adolescence,"Gentile, D.

,Violent Video Games Increase Voice Stress: An Experimental Study,"In most violent video games, players are put in stressful situations where enemies are trying to kill them. This is reflected by the results of previous research showing that violent video games increase physiological arousal (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure, galvanic skin response). In this study, I investigate the effect of playing violent video games on emotional stress detected by a new methodology: voice analysis. Because changes and disturbances in vocal responses can be understood as reactions to emotional stress, I expected that violent videogames would increase voice stress. Participants (N 87 French university students; 40% female; Mage 21.2) played either a violent or nonviolent game for 20 min. After game play, participants read a stressprovoking story aloud while their voices were recorded. Voice recordings were analyzed to determine the amount of emotional stress in participants' voices using Automated Voice Stress Analysis. As hypothesized, voice stress was higher among violent video game players than among nonviolent video game players. Voice stress was also higher for men than for women. No interaction between video game content and the gender of participants was observed. This study confirms that violent video games have physiological consequences on players, as predicted by the General Aggression Model and also introduces a promising nonobtrusive physiological measure in media psychology research. © 2015 American Psychological Association.",doi,10.1037/ppm0000083,Scopus,Psychology of Popular Media Culture,Hasan Y.,2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas

The aim was to test the effectiveness of a virtual reality (VR)-based exercise program in improving the physical fitness of adults with severe IDD when implemented by on-site caregivers. A research group (N= 20; mean age ± standard deviation = 47.9 ± 8.6 years; severe IDD level) was matched for age, IDD level and functional abilities with a comparison group (N= 24, mean age = 46.2 ± 9.3 years; severe IDD level). An 8-week fitness program consisting of 2-3 30-min sessions per week included game-like exercises provided by the IREX/GX video capture VR system. Changes in physical fitness were monitored by changes in heart rate at rest. A significant (P< 0.005) reduction in heart rate was demonstrated for the research group. No change in heart rate was monitored in the comparison group. Despite statistically significant improvements in heart rate, the results are not strong enough functionally to claim that this program improved physical fitness of individuals with severe intellectual disability. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.ridd.2010.01.010,Scopus,Research in Developmental Disabilities,"Lotan M., Yalon-Chamovitz S., Weiss P.L.T.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Webcam-Based Detection Of Emotional States,"Game designers have to deal with the complex task of monitoring the emotional state of players in games. There are different elements with the game, which effect the player’s emotional status. Since the game play experience occurs almost unconsciously, traditional methods such as think aloud may disrupt the playing experience, thus skewing the results obtained. Other methods include fitting cables and electrodes to the player to monitor biological information. Although such devices can offer significant accurate results, they are not commonly found and may cause discomfort while playing games. Because of this, we propose a webcam-based heart rate monitoring method that can be used to predict the player’s emotional state. We first analyzed the change in heart rate with respect to the players emotional state. This allowed us to find a correlation between emotional states, such as frustration, fun, challenge, and boredom. The second objective was to create a webcam-based method to monitor the heart rate. This was performed by extracting the RGB channels from the face region and then retrieving the underlying components using a dimensionality-reduction method. The results obtained from the webcam-based method were far from perfect, but this was expected, since we were performing the tests under realistic conditions. The last objective was to predict the player’s emotional state using the heart rate obtained from the webcam-based method. The accuracy of the prediction was up to 76 %, which exceeded our initial aim. This system will be implemented in Unity 3D to make its integration and adoption easier. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",doi,10.1007/s00371-016-1309-x,Scopus,Visual Computer,"Dingli A., Giordimaina A.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Weighting Positive Versus Negative: The Fundamental Nature Of Valence Asymmetry,"Objective: The relation between weighting of valence information in attitude generalization and evaluation of novel/hypothetical situations was explored. Method: Undergraduate participants played a computer game requiring them to learn which stimuli (beans) would increase/decrease their points. Later, participants classified the valence of game beans and novel ones varying in resemblance to game beans. The weighting bias in attitude generalization was estimated as the average response to novel beans, controlling for game bean learning. We examined whether this bias related to judgments of hypothetical situations concerning interpersonal relationships (Study 1), threat assessment (Study 2), risk propensities (Study 3), and risk behavior (Study 6). We also assessed whether valence weighting is specifically predictive of novel situations (Studies 4 and 5). Finally, we explored participants' ability to self-report their weighting bias (Study 7). Results: Valence weighting in attitude generalization was related to judgments of novel situations and risk behavior. The performance-based measure did not correlate with responses to various questionnaires related to valence weighting. Conclusions: There is a fundamental individual difference associated with valence weighting, resulting in the relation between two processes unrelated in content, but sharing the essential characteristic of valence weighting-attitude generalization and evaluation of novel situations. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",doi,10.1111/j.1467-6494.2012.00800.x,Scopus,Journal of Personality,"Pietri E.S., Fazio R.H., Shook N.J.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas

,What Hispanic Parents Do To Encourage And Discourage 3-5 Year Old Children To Be Active: A Qualitative Study Using Nominal Group Technique,"Purpose: Hispanic preschoolers are less active than their non-Hispanic peers. As part of a feasibility study to assess environmental and parenting influences on preschooler physical activity (PA) (Niños Activos), the aim of this study was to identify what parents do to encourage or discourage PA among Hispanic 3-5 year old children to inform the development of a new PA parenting practice instrument and future interventions to increase PA among Hispanic youth. Methods: Nominal Group Technique (NGT), a structured multi-step group procedure, was used to elicit and prioritize responses from 10 groups of Hispanic parents regarding what parents do to encourage (5 groups) or discourage (5 groups) preschool aged children to be active. Five groups consisted of parents with low education (less than high school) and 5 with high education (high school or greater) distributed between the two NGT questions. Results: Ten NGT groups (n = 74, range 4-11/group) generated 20-46 and 42-69 responses/group for practices that encourage or discourage PA respectively. Eight to 18 responses/group were elected as the most likely to encourage or discourage PA. Parental engagement in child activities, modeling PA, and feeding the child well were identified as parenting practices that encourage child PA. Allowing TV and videogame use, psychological control, physical or emotional abuse, and lack of parental engagement emerged as parenting practices that discourage children from being active. There were few differences in the pattern of responses by education level.Conclusions: Parents identified ways they encourage and discourage 3-5 year-olds from PA, suggesting both are important targets for interventions. These will inform the development of a new PA parenting practice scale to be further evaluated. Further research should explore the role parents play in discouraging child PA, especially in using psychological control or submitting children to abuse, which were new findings in this study. © 2013 O'Connor et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",doi,10.1186/1479-5868-10-93,Scopus,International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity,"O'Connor T.M., Cerin E., Hughes S.O., Robles J., Thompson D., Baranowski T., Lee R.E., Nicklas T., Shewchuk R.M.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,What Is The Identity Of A Sports Spectator?,"Despite the prominence of sports in contemporary society, little is known about the identity and personality traits of sports spectators. With a sample of 293 individuals, we examine four broad categories of factors that may explain variability in the reported amount of time spent watching sports. Using individual difference regression techniques, we explore the relationship between sports spectating and physiological measures (e.g., testosterone and cortisol), clinical self-report scales (ADHD and autism), personality traits (e.g., NEO ""Big Five""), and pastime activities (e.g., video game playing). Our results indicate that individuals who report higher levels of sports spectating tend to have higher levels of extraversion, and in particular excitement seeking and gregariousness. These individuals also engage more in complementary pastime activities, including participating in sports and exercise activities, watching TV/movies, and playing video games. Notably, no differences were observed in the clinical self-report scales, indicating no differences in reported symptoms of ADHD or autism for spectators and non-spectators. Likewise, no relationship was seen between baseline concentrations of testosterone or cortisol and sports spectating in our sample. These results provide an assessment of the descriptive personality dimensions of frequent sports spectators and provide a basic taxonomy of how these traits are expressed across the population. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.paid.2011.10.048,Scopus,Personality and Individual Differences,"Gregory Appelbaum L., Cain M.S., Darling E.F., Stanton S.J., Nguyen M.T., Mitroff S.R.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,When Playing Together Feels Different: Effects Of Task Types And Social Contexts On Physiological Arousal In Multiplayer Online Gaming Contexts,"This study examines how task types (violent vs. nonviolent) and social contexts (solo vs. collaborative) affect physiological arousal in multiplayer online gaming. Our results show that social contexts modify the effects of violent game tasks on arousal. When compared with solo play, collaborative play led to a significant decrease in arousal in response to violent tasks, while leading to a slight increase for nonviolent tasks. The findings point to the importance of understanding how social contexts of game playing shape psychological experiences in multiplayer online games. © 2009 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",doi,10.1089/cpb.2008.0054,Scopus,Cyberpsychology and Behavior,"Lim S., Lee J.-E.R.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,[Comparative Studies On Influences Of Physical And Psychological Strain On The Ecg In Coronary Disease Patients].,"In 7 patients suffering from heart infarction the electrocardiogram was telemetrically registered during telecast of the world championship in football 1974. The same patients were tested on a bicycle ergometer with standardized loads of 50, 75, 100 and 125 Watt for 3 minutes. Heart rate under psychial strain did not exceed the rate of 50 Watt on bicycle ergometer. Only 1 patient showed some extrasystoles during ergometry. Looking at television all patients developed extrasystoles, in one case 122. If the FRG took part in the game, ventricular extrasystoles were two times, auricular extrasystoles were four times more frequent than during games between foreign countries. It is concluded that psychical strain is able to produce dangerous arrhythmias in patients suffering from coronary heart disease. This danger cannot be proved by bicycle ergometry.",pmid,59480,pubmed,Zeitschrift fur Kardiologie,"Stein, G; Jungmann, H",1976,NA,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,[Hormone And Metabolism Behavior In Distress Without Physical Stress].,"The psychological effects on cortisol, human growth hormone (HGH), free fatty acids and lactate were investigated in 10 healthy students using a one hour television game. To insure that only the psychological aspects of the game were being measured, hematocrit, creatininkinase, CK-MB and myoglobin were used as controls. The game began 60 minutes after venapuncture of a lower arm vein with an indwelling catheter. Blood samples were taken 30 and 60 minutes after venapuncture, at intervals of 20 minutes during the game and 30, 60 and 120 minutes after the end of the game. After an initial rise, plasma cortisol levels sank steadily and significantly (alpha = 1%). The HGH level initially fell, but as the game progressed, rose and remained at a high level for a considerable period after the game had ended. These variations however were not statistically significant. The three free fatty acids under investigations, myristinic acid (C14), palmitic acid (C16), and stearic acid (C18), all showed similar levels over the course of the experiment. During the first 20 minutes of the play, free fatty acid levels rose, with stearic acid levels rising the most (52%). The free fatty acid levels then sank as the game progressed, with the palmitinic acid level showing a significant decline (alpha = 1%). The other parameters remained relatively constant during the experiment, with the exception of the CK-MB level, which showed severe, hard-to-interpret variations.",pmid,3984537,pubmed,Zeitschrift fur Psychosomatische Medizin und Psychoanalyse,"Abdulla, W; Ludes, H; Frey, R",1985,NA,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Active Video/Arcade Games (Exergaming) And Energy Expenditure In College Students.,"Video games have become increasingly popular among young adults. The purpose of this pilot study was to determine if interactive video/arcade games, requiring physical activity to play, increase the energy expenditure (EE) and heart rate (HR) of young adults enough to elicit a training response. Thirteen male and female participants 26.6 ± 5.7 years of age were in the study. Participants were familiarized with equipment and allowed to practice with three games: (1) moving and striking lighted pads, (2) riding a bike to increase the pace of a race car, and (3) boxing against a video simulated opponent. A portable metabolic cart and HR monitor were attached to participants to measure baseline and exercise values. Participants could play any of the three games for 30 minutes while metabolic and HR data were collected. Exercise data were compared to baseline measures, and the 3 games were compared for EE. Paired sample t-tests showed baseline and exercise values differed for HR (t(12) = -18.91, p < 0.01), and EE (t(12) = -15.62, p < 0.01). The boxing game provided the highest VO2 (17.47 ± 4.79 ml·kg(·-1)min(-1)). Participants achieved 60% or better of their HR reserve (162.82 ± 10.78 beats·min(-1),) well within the ACSM guidelines for a training HR. Caloric expenditure during the 30-minute exercise session (226. 07 ± 48.68) is also within the ACSM recommendations for daily physical activity. Thus, interactive video/arcade games that require physical activity to play can be utilized as part of an overall aerobic exercise program.",pmid,20407622,pubmed,International journal of exercise science,"Siegel, Shannon R; L Haddock, Bryan; Dubois, Andrea M; Wilkin, Linda D",2017,NA,NA,reviewer2,Tamas

,Cognitive/Attentional Distraction In The Control Of Conditioned Nausea In Pediatric Cancer Patients Receiving Chemotherapy,"Two studies were conducted to investigate the use of cognitive/attentional distraction (via commercially available video games) to control conditioned nausea in pediatric cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. The first study compared the nausea severity in children who played video games during chemotherapy-related procedures with that of control-group children who did not play video games. The second study used a combined ABAB withdrawal and repeated measures analysis of variance design that incorporated baseline and intervention assessments within a single session. In both studies, video game-playing resulted in significantly less nausea. The introduction and withdrawal of the opportunity to play video games produced significant changes (reduction and exacerbation, respectively) in nausea. Although video games also reduced self-reported anxiety, the effects were weaker than those for nausea. Pulse rate and systolic/diastolic blood pressure were not consistently affected. © 1987 American Psychological Association.",pmid,3597954,Scopus,Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology,"Redd W.H., Jacobsen P.B., Die-Trill M., Dermatis H., McEvoy M., Holland J.C.",1987,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Competitive Active Video Games: Physiological And Psychological Responses In Children And Adolescents.,"Recent strategies to reduce sedentary behaviour in children include replacing sedentary screen time for active video games. Active video game studies have focused principally on the metabolic consumption of a single player, with physiological and psychological responses of opponent-based multiplayer games to be further evaluated. To determine whether adding a competitive component to playing active video games impacts physiological and psychological responses in players. Sixty-two healthy Caucasian children and adolescents, nine to 14 years years of age, completed three conditions (8 min each) in random order: treadmill walking, and single and opponent-based Kinect active video games. Affect, arousal, rate of perceived exertion, heart rate and percentage of heart rate reserve were measured for each participant and condition. Kinect conditions revealed significantly higher heart rate, percentage of heart rate reserve, rate of perceived exertion and arousal when compared with treadmill walking (P<0.001). Opponent-based condition revealed lower values for the rate of perceived exertion (P=0.02) and higher affect (P=0.022) when compared with single play. Competitive active video games improved children's psychological responses (affect and rate of perceived exertion) compared with single play, providing a solution that may contribute toward improved adherence to physical activity. Parmi les récentes stratégies en vue de réduire les comportements sédentaires chez les enfants, soulignons le remplacement du temps d’écran sédentaire par des jeux vidéo actifs. Les études sur ce type de jeux ont surtout porté sur la consommation métabolique en mode solo. Les réponses physiologiques et psychologiques de jeux en mode multijoueur comportant des adversaires n’ont pas encore été évaluées. Déterminer si l’ajout d’un élément compétitif aux jeux vidéo actifs influe sur les réponses physiologiques et psychologiques chez les joueurs. Soixante-deux enfants et adolescents blancs en bonne santé de neuf à 14 ans ont effectué trois conditionnements de huit minutes chacun, dans un ordre aléatoire : marche sur tapis roulant et jeux vidéo actifs Kinect en mode solo et multijoueur (Microsoft Corporation, États-Unis). Les chercheurs ont mesuré l’affect, l’éveil, le taux d’effort perçu, la fréquence cardiaque et le pourcentage de réserve de fréquence cardiaque de chaque participant et de chaque conditionnement. Le conditionnement Kinect a suscité une augmentation significative de la fréquence cardiaque, du pourcentage de réserve de fréquence cardiaque, d’effort perçu et d’éveil par rapport à la marche sur tapis roulant (P<0,001). Le conditionnement contre un adversaire révélait des valeurs plus faibles de taux d’effort perçu (P=0,02) et un affect plus élevé (P=0,022) que le jeu en mode solo. Les jeux vidéo actifs compétitifs donnent de meilleures réponses psychologiques chez les enfants (affect et taux d’efforts perçu) que le jeu en mode solo.

,Designing Affective Video Games To Support The Social-Emotional Development Of Teenagers With Autism Spectrum Disorders.,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of developmental neuropsychiatric disorders, comprised of three diagnostic entities - autistic disorder (AD), Asperger's disorder (AS), and Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (including atypical autism) (PDD-NOS). A number of intervention techniques are currently used to reduce some of the associated challenges, with techniques ranging from behavioral therapy to dietary interventions and traditional counseling. This positional paper proposes the use of video games which leverage affective computing technologies as intervention in autism spectrum disorders in the context of the use of traditional play therapy with adolescents, who may feel uncomfortable engaging in traditional play with toys they may be too old for. It aims to explore the potential for greater 'social physics' made possible by affective computing technologies. This involves computationally 'recognizing' emotions in a user, often through the use of multimodal affective sensors, including facial expressions, postural shifts, and physiological signals such as heart rate, skin conductivity, and EEG signals. However, it is suggested that this should be augmented by researching the effect of social game design mechanisms on social-emotional development, particularly for those who experience difficulty with social interaction.",pmid,19592726,pubmed,Studies in health technology and informatics,"Khandaker, Mitu",2016,NA,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Does Virtual Reality-Based Kinect Dance Training Paradigm Improve Autonomic Nervous System Modulation In Individuals With Chronic Stroke?,"Physical inactivity and low resting heart rate variability (HRV) are associated with an increased cardiovascular deconditioning, risk of secondary stroke and mortality. Aerobic dance is a multidimensional physical activity and recent research supports its application as a valid alternative cardiovascular training. Furthermore, technological advances have facilitated the emergence of new approaches for exercise training holding promise, especially those methods that integrate rehabilitation with virtual gaming. The purpose of this study was to evaluate cardiac autonomic modulation in individuals with chronic stroke post-training using a virtual reality - based aerobic dance training paradigm. Eleven community-dwelling individuals with hemiparetic stroke [61.7( ± 4.3) years] received a virtual reality-based dance paradigm for 6 weeks using the commercially available Kinect dance video game ""Just Dance 3."" The training was delivered in a high-intensity tapering method with the first two weeks consisting of 5 sessions/week, next two weeks of 3 sessions/week and last two weeks of 2 sessions/week, with a total of 20 sessions. Data obtained for HRV analysis pre- and post-intervention consists of HRV for ten minutes in (1) supine resting position; (2) quiet standing. High-frequency (HF) power measures as indicators of cardiac parasympathetic activity, low-frequency (LF) power of parasympathetic-sympathetic balance and LF/HF of sympatho-vagal balance were calculated. YMCA submaximal cycle Ergometer test was used to acquire VO2 max pre- and post-intervention. Changes in physical activity during dance training were assessed using Omran HJ-321 Tri-Axis Pedometer. After training, participants demonstrated a significant improvement in autonomic modulation in the supine position, indicating an improvement in LF=48.4 ( ± 20.1) to 40.3 ( ± 8.0), p=0.03; HF=51.5 ( ± 19) to 59.7 ( ± 8), p= 0.02 and LF/HF=1.6 ( ± 1.9) to 0.8 ( ± 0.26), p=0.05]. Post-training the participants had significantly higher VO2max. Number of steps during dance intervention significantly increased from the 1st to the 20th session (p<0.05). The current study is the first to assess the effect of a virtual reality-based aerobic dance training paradigm on HRV among individuals with chronic stroke. Given that the paradigm used in this study improves cardiac autonomic control, future studies should incorporate dance as an adjuvant therapy into clinical treatment program and assess its long-term efficacy.",pmid,27829967,pubmed,Journal of vascular and interventional neurology,"Sampaio, Luciana Maria Malosá; Subramaniam, Savitha; Arena, Ross; Bhatt, Tanvi",2017,NA,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,"Eeg, Hrv And Psychological Correlates While Playing Bejeweled Ii: A Randomized Controlled Study.","Stress related medical disorders such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, depression, and anxiety are serious medical issues that can cause disability and death. Interventions to prevent their development and exacerbation are needed. Casual video games (CVGs) are fun, easy to play, spontaneous and tremendously popular. People report that they play these games because they decrease their stress and improve their mood. This study tested this theory by comparing people playing Bejeweled II a popular CVG with control subjects measured under similar conditions. Electroencephalographic (EEG) changes after playing Bejeweled II were consistent with increased mood and corroborated with similar findings on psychological reports. Moreover, heart rate variability (HRV) changes consistent with autonomic nervous system relaxation or decreased physical stress were also recorded. It is concluded, therefore, that playing a CVG like Bejeweled II can increase mood and decrease stress. These finding have broad implications and include the potential development of prescriptive interventions using Bejeweled II to prevent and treat stress related medical disorders. Finally, these findings demonstrate a method using EEG, HRV and psychological correlates to understand the psychophysiological or cybernetic interconnection between participant and video game.",pmid,19592761,pubmed,Studies in health technology and informatics,"Russoniello, Carmen V; O'Brien, Kevin; Parks, Jennifer M",2016,NA,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Effect Of Court Dimensions On Players' External And Internal Load During Small-Sided Handball Games.,"The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of three different court dimensions on the internal and external load during small-sided handball games. Six male amateur handball players took part in this study and participated in three different 8-min 3vs3 (plus goalkeepers) small-sided handball games (each repeated twice). The three court dimensions were 12×24m, 30×15m and 32×16m. Through Global Positioning System devices (SPI pro elite 15Hz, GPSports) and video analysis, the following parameters were recorded: cyclic and acyclic movements (distance covered and number of technical actions executed), heart rate, and rating of perceived exertion (RPE). Total distance travelled increased with court dimensions (885.2m ± 66.6m in 24×12m; 980.0m ± 73.4m in 30×15m; 1095.0m ± 112.9m in 32×16m, p < 0.05). The analysis of distance covered in the four speed zones (0-1.4 m·s(-1); 1.4-3.4 m·s(-1); 3.4-5.2 m·s(-1); >5.2 m·s(-1)) highlighted substantial differences: playing with the 30×15m court in comparison to the 24×12m, the players covered less distance in the first speed zone (p = 0.012; ES = 0.70) and more distance in the second (p = 0.049; ES = 0.73) and third (p = 0.012; ES = 0.51) speed zones. Statistical differences were also found between the 24×12m and 32×16m courts: the players covered more distance in the second and third speed zones (p = 0.013, ES = 0.76; p = 0.023 ES = 0.69) with the 32×16m court in comparison to the 24×12m. There was no significant effect of court dimensions on the technical parameters (number of team actions, passes, piston movements toward goal and defensive activities), the number of specific handball jumps and changes of direction, and the time spent in the different heart rate zones. Considering the average data of all the experimental conditions together (24×12m, 30×15m, 32×16m), a pronounced statistical difference was highlighted between the values in first two HR zones and the last two (p < 0.05; large ES). The rating of perceived exertion was significantly higher during the drill with the 32×16m court compared with the 24×12m one (p < 0.05; ES = 2.34). Our findings indicate that changing court dimensions during small-sided handball games can be used to manipulate both external and internal loads on the players. Key pointsTo cover the specific game demands, more specific training methodologies have been developed in many sport games.Specific game exercises may provide a useful conditioning stimulus, together with technical and tactical training components.Changing court dimensions during small-sided handball games can be used to manipulate both external and internal loads on the players.The high ratio of cyclic activity per minute and the high HR values recorded during SSHGs make this type of drills extremely useful for aerobic power training.",pmid,24790482,pubmed,Journal of sports science &amp; medicine,"Corvino, Matteo; Tessitore, Antonio; Minganti, Carlo; Sibila, Marko",2014,NA,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Features Of Learning Voluntary Control Of Posture After Pyramidal And Nigrostriatal Lesions,"The study was aimed at investigation of a deficit of learning the center-of-pressure voluntary control in patients with lesions of corticospinal and nigrostriatal systems. Thirty three patients with Parkinson's disease and 20 patients with hemiparesis after cerebrovascular accidents in the MCA participated in the investigation. The subjects stood on a force platform and in the form of a computer game were trained to match the projection of the center of pressure (a cursor) with a target on the screen under the visual feedback control. Two different postural tasks were presented. In the first task the direction of the center-of-pressure shift was not known before, so the subject learned the general strategy of the center-pressure control. In the other task a precise postural coordination should be formed. The voluntary control of the center-of-pressure position was found to be impaired in both groups of patients. In the task of moving the center of pressure in various directions (general strategy), no differences in the initial deficit of the task performance were found between the groups, but the learning was more efficient in the group of hemiparetic patients. However, in the task with precise postural coordination, despite the greater initial deficit in the parkinsonian patients, the learning in this group of patients was substantially more efficient than in hemiparetic patients. The results suggest both common and different features of the involvement of the corticospinal and nigrostriatal systems in learning voluntary control of posture. © 2003.",pmid,12889203,Scopus,Zhurnal Vysshei Nervnoi Deyatelnosti Imeni I.P.

,Gender Differences In Patterns Of Dynamic Cardiovascular Regulation,"The purpose of this research was to examine the role of gender in hemodynamic response patterns to stress.Sixty-four male and 55 female young adults were administered a protocol of rest, mental arithmetic, video game, and anger recall interview while blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac impedance measures were obtained. Men had higher levels of systolic blood pressure and cardiac output and greater reactivity to tasks, indexed by increases in cardiac output and diastolic blood pressure. Extreme groups of myocardial and vascular reactors were formed from cardiac output and total peripheral resistance change scores during mental arithmetic. The myocardial reactors exhibited greater sensitivity to task demands, whereas vascular reactors exhibited comparable total peripheral resistance increases to all tasks. Vascular reactors exhibited greater diastolic blood pressure reactivity than myocardial reactors. Future studies should address the predictive validity of these reactor patterns for the subsequent development of coronary heart disease. © 1995 by American Psychosomatic Society.",pmid,7480565,Scopus,Psychosomatic Medicine,"Lawler K.A., Wilcox Z.C., Anderson S.F.",1995,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Individual Differences In Heart Rate And Peripheral Vascular Responses To An Extended Aversive Task.,"Psychophysiological research on situations requiring active coping has to this point dealt primarily with cardiac responses. Recent studies of vascular responses to such stressors have found conditions in high cardiac reactors that are possible precursors to autoregulatory vasoconstriction. The present study exposed 32 healthy male undergraduates to a one-hour shock avoidance procedure, with avoidance made contingent on video-game performance. Subjects also participated in a separate counterbalanced baseline session. The relationships among individual differences in heart rate, forearm blood flow, forearm vascular resistance, and digital blood volume pulse responses at different points in the stress session were examined. Decreases in forearm vascular resistance were observed only among high and medium heart rate reactors. As the session progressed, however, forearm vascular resistance responses of the medium heart rate reactors were sustained whereas those of the high heart rate reactors habituated despite the fact that heart rate and forearm blood flow responses remained elevated. The potential implications of this pattern of results to an autoregulation theory of hypertension development are discussed. Heart rate reactivity was inversely related to performance on the video-game task but was unrelated to Type A or anxiety.",pmid,2616699,pubmed,Psychophysiology,"Miller, S B; Ditto, B",1990,NA,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Inhibitory Effect Of An Intellectual Task On Breathing After Voluntary Hyperventilation,"We investigated the effects of an intellectual task on posthyperventilation (PHV) breathing by using a video game. Eight normal subjects were placed in a supine position. The game task by itself led to increased ventilation compared with the control tasks via an increase in the average inspiratory flow rate (P < 0.01) and the respiratory frequency (P < 0.001). After hypocapnic voluntary hyperventilation (VHV), the task led to a decrease in the 1-min PHV breathing level compared with the control tasks after VHV [after VHV, first 60 s of average minute ventilation while watching television and while playing a video game are 5.54 ± 2.91 (SD) and 2.05 ± 1.40 l/min, respectively; P < 0.01]. Only one subject showed PHV apnea for at least 10 s during the control protocol, whereas seven of the same eight subjects showed PHV apnea while performing the task. After isocapnic VHV, the task still led to a decrease in PHV breathing compared with the control tasks. However, this decrease was smaller than in the hypocapnic studies and was only significant during the first 15 s of recovery. These results suggest that increased activity in the higher centers of the central nervous system has an inhibitory effect on PHV breathing at a time when the effects of short-term potentiation after VHV, hypocapnia, and perhaps other mechanisms would be expected to be acting on breathing.",pmid,8889777,Scopus,Journal of Applied Physiology,"Chin K., Ohi M., Fukui M., Kita H., Tsuboi T., Noguchi T., Otsuka N., Hirata H., Mishima M., Kuno K.",1996,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Metabolic Demands Of Match Performance In Young Soccer Players.,"The aim of the present study was to determine metabolic responses, movement patterns and distance covered at running speeds corresponding to fixed blood lactate concentrations (FBLs) in young soccer players during a match play. A further aim of the study was to evaluate the relationships between FBLs, maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) and distance covered during a game. A multistage field test was administered to 32 players to determine FBLs and VO2max. Blood lactate (LA), heart rate (HR) and rate of perceived exertion (RPE) responses were obtained from 36 players during tournament matches filmed using six fixed cameras. Images were transferred to a computer, for calibration and synchronization. In all players, values for LA and HR were higher and RPE lower during the 1(st) half compared to the 2(nd) half of the matches (p < 0.01). Players in forward positions had higher LA levels than defenders, but HR and RPE values were similar between playing positions. Total distance and distance covered in jogging, low-moderate-high intensity running and low intensity sprint were higher during the 1(st) half (p < 0.01). In the 1(st) half, players also ran longer distances at FBLs [p<0.01; average running speed at 2mmol·L(-1) (FBL2): 3.32 ± 0.31m·s(-1) and average running speed at 4mmol·L(-1) (FBL4): 3.91 ± 0.25m·s(-1)]. There was a significant difference between playing positions in distance covered at different running speeds (p < 0.05). However, when distance covered was expressed as FBLs, the players ran similar distances. In addition, relationships between FBLs and total distance covered were significant (r = 0.482 to 0.570; p < 0.01). In conclusion, these findings demonstrated that young soccer players experienced higher internal load during the 1(st) half of a game compared to the 2(nd) half. Furthermore, although movement patterns of players differed between playing positions, all players experienced a similar physiological stress throughout the game. Finally, total distance covered was associated to fixed blood lactate concentrations during play. Key pointsBased on LA, HR and RPE responses, young top soccer players experienced a higher physiological stress during the 1(st) half of the matches compared to the 2(nd) half.Movement patterns differed in accordance with the players' positions but that all players experienced a similar physiological stress during match play.Approximately one quarter of total distance was covered at speeds that exceeded the 4 mmol·L(-1) fixed LA threshold.Total distance covered was influenced by running speeds at fixed lactate concentrations in young soccer players during match play.",pmid,24149134,pubmed,Journal of sports science &amp; medicine,"Aslan, Alper; Acikada, Caner; Güvenç, Alpay; Gören, Hasan; Hazir, Tahir; Ozkara, Asaf",2013,NA,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Modernization In The Samoas And Children's Reactivity: A Pilot Study,"This investigation studied the potential effects of societal modernization on Samoan children's blood pressure and heart rate reactivity to a standardized television video game procedure. Ethnic Samoan children were sampled from Western Samoa (N = 72), a relatively underdeveloped country with a largely agricultural economy, and American Samoa (N = 70), a territory of the United States that has undergone substantial modernization due to recent economic aid. Results indicated that Western Samoans demonstrated significantly greater systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate reactivity than American Samoans. These data, in conjunction with previous data, suggest that the hemodynamic effects of an acute stressor are inversely associated with societal modernization and an individual's adoption of a lifestyle reflecting integration into a modernized society. Further work is needed to examine the implications of this hypothesis and the associations among concrete measures of modernization and children's cardiovascular risk.",pmid,7809338,Scopus,Psychosomatic Medicine,"Murphy J.K., McGarvey S.T.",1994,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas

,Social Cognitions As Organizers Of Autonomic And Affective Responses To Social Challenge,"Autonomic and affective responses to children were assessed as a function of adult perceptions of interpersonal control. Women (N = 160) interacted with and provided feedback to computer-simulated children who ""behaved"" responsively or unresponsively on a computer game. Women were categorized as low in perceived control (PC) if they attributed high control to children but low control to self over negative events on the Parent Attribution Test. As predicted, low-PC women were maximally reactive to child characteristics, manifesting peak levels of defensive arousal (increased level of heart rate and electrodermal activity) and negative affect with unresponsive children and minimal levels of arousal and negative affect with responsive children. Intermediate response levels were shown by high-PC Ss. We interpreted results as suggesting mediating factors that may operate in dysfunctional interaction patterns previously found for low-PC caregivers. © 1993 American Psychological Association.",pmid,8421254,Scopus,Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,"Bugental D.B., Blue J., Cortez V., Fleck K., Kopeikin H., Lewis J.C., Lyon J.",1993,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Socioeconomic Status And Blood Pressure Reactivity In Healthy Black Adolescents.,"Adolescents in low-socioeconomic-status environments are more susceptible to illnesses, such as hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. This study examined the influence of both neighborhood- and family-level socioeconomic status (SES) on blood pressure (BP) reactivity in a healthy sample of 76 black adolescents. It was hypothesized that a higher level of parental education and/or income would reduce the elevated BP reactivity associated with living in poorer neighborhoods. Census-derived data were obtained using each participant's address. Neighborhood level of SES was based on percentage of households below the poverty line, female-headed households, owner-occupied housing, percentage vacant housing, and average number of persons per household. Family level of SES was based on self-reported level of parental education and annual family income. Adolescents participated in a competitive video game to establish their BP reactivity scores. As predicted, adolescents who lived in poorer neighborhoods had lower diastolic BPs if their parents were more (versus less) educated (P<0.05; 7+/-8 versus 13+/-6 mm Hg). Adolescents who lived in poorer neighborhoods also had significantly lower diastolic BP reactivity (P<0.05) if their family had a higher (versus lower) annual income (7+/-7 versus 12+/-8 mm Hg). These data are the first to demonstrate the buffering effect of family SES on the negative health consequences of living in low-SES neighborhoods in healthy black adolescents.",pmid,10642348,pubmed,"Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)","Wilson, D K; Kliewer, W; Plybon, L; Sica, D A",2e3,NA,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,The Association Of Race And Sex To The Pressure Natriuresis Response To Stress,"Objective: Sympathetic nervous system activation promoting sodium retention has long been recognized to play a significant role in the development and maintenance of salt-sensitive hypertension. The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of race and sex on the pressure natriuresis response to prolonged behavioral stress in youth. Methods: The 190 subjects included 94 boys (41 African American, 53 Caucasian) and 96 girls (44 African American, 52 Caucasian) of similar age (17-19 years). The stress test was composed of a one hour competitive video game task preceded and followed by two-hour rest periods. Blood pressure (BP) was obtained at 15 minute intervals and sodium excretion (UNaV) was measured hourly. The general linear model was used to model the effects of race, sex, and their interaction on the variables of interest. Results: Caucasians, compared to African Americans, had a greater change in UNaV (F[1,183]=5.28, P=.0227), as did boys compared to girls (F[1,183]=5.72, P=.0178), with no interaction between race and sex. The race-by-sex interaction was significant for the change in systolic BP (F[1,183]=5.66, P=.0184), with Caucasian girls showing a smaller change than the other three race/sex groups. Conclusion: African Americans have a reduced natriuretic response to stress, which may be a marker or mechanism for the development of salt-sensitive hypertension in this population. The race difference within girls is of interest and requires further investigation.",pmid,17985504,Scopus,Ethnicity and Disease,"Harshfield G.A., Hanevold C., Kapuku G.K., Dong Y., Castles M.E., Ludwig D.A.",2007,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,The Design Of The M-Health Service Application Using A Nintendo Ds Game Console.,"In this article, we developed an m-health monitoring system using a Nintendo DS game console to demonstrate its utility. The proposed system consists of a biosignal acquisition device, wireless sensor network, base-station for signal reception from the sensor network and signal conversion according to Internet protocol, personal computer display program, and the Nintendo DS game console. The system collects three-channel electrocardiogram (ECG) signals for cardiac abnormality detection and three-axis accelerometer signals for fall detection of a person. The collected signals are then transmitted to the base-station through the wireless sensor network, where they are transformed according to the transmission control protocol/Internet protocol (TCP/IP) and sent to the destination IP through Internet network. To test the developed system, the collected signals were displayed on a computer located in different building through wired Internet network and also simultaneously displayed on the Nintendo DS game console connected to Internet network wirelessly. The system was able to collect and transmit signals for more than 24h without any interruptions or malfunctions, showing the possibility of integrating healthcare monitoring functions into a small handheld-type electronic device developed for different purposes without significant complications. It is expected that the system can be used in an ambulance, nursing home, or general hospital where efficient patient monitoring from long distance is necessary.",pmid,21214393,Scopus,Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,"Lee S., Kim J., Lee M.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,The Dynamics Of Psychological Momentum In Sport: The Role Of Ongoing History Of Performance Patterns,"Borrowing the dynamical systems perspective, two studies aimed to examine the potential properties of nonlinearity and history dependence of psychological momentum. Male regional-level table tennis players were asked to empathize with players in a very important contest by watching two video scenarios of a table tennis game in two separate sessions. The videos presented two inverted scenarios in which score gaps gradually increased or decreased. Competitive anxiety, selfconfidence (Study 1), and goal involvement states (Study 2) were measured before each point. Cognitive and somatic anxieties decreased linearly during the increasing scenario, but increased nonlinearly in the decreasing scenario. Mastery-avoidance goals decreased nonlinearly in the increasing scenario, increased nonlinearly in the decreasing scenario, and displayed a negative hysteresis pattern. These findings offer new insights into the dynamics of psychological momentum and suggest new avenues of research. © 2010 Human Kinetics, Inc.",pmid,20587824,Scopus,Journal of Sport and Exercise Psychology,"Gernigon C., Briki W., Eykens K.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,The Opponent Matters: Elevated Fmri Reward Responses To Winning Against A Human Versus A Computer Opponent During Interactive Video Game Playing.,"Winning against an opponent in a competitive video game can be expected to be more rewarding than losing, especially when the opponent is a fellow human player rather than a computer. We show that winning versus losing in a first-person video game activates the brain's reward circuit and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) differently depending on the type of the opponent. Participants played a competitive tank shooter game against alleged human and computer opponents while their brain activity was measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Brain responses to wins and losses were contrasted by fitting an event-related model to the hemodynamic data. Stronger activation to winning was observed in ventral and dorsal striatum as well as in vmPFC. Activation in ventral striatum was associated with participants' self-ratings of pleasure. During winning, ventral striatum showed stronger functional coupling with right insula, and weaker coupling with dorsal striatum, sensorimotor pre- and postcentral gyri, and visual association cortices. The vmPFC and dorsal striatum responses were stronger to winning when the subject was playing against a human rather than a computer. These results highlight the importance of social context in the neural encoding of reward value.",pmid,22952277,Scopus,"Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)","Kätsyri J., Hari R., Ravaja N., Nummenmaa L.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,"Using A Virtual Game System To Innovate Pulmonary Rehabilitation: Safety, Adherence And Enjoyment In Severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease","objective: The present pilot study tested the use of a virtual game system (VGS) for exercise training in patients with moderate to very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease undergoing pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). Safety, feasibility, enjoyment and adherence were assessed. Methods: VGS (Wii [2006], Nintendo, USA) games were prescreened and categorized into lower- and upper-body workouts. Patients admitted for a three- to four-week inpatient PR program exercised daily. They were provided an opportunity to individually engage in VGS sessions three times weekly, varying with length of stay. Dyspnea, oxygen saturation and heart rate were measured before, during and after game sessions. Patients were considered to be adherent if they attended at least 50% of VGS sessions. Adverse events and enjoyment were evaluated. Results: Thirty-two patients witha mean (± SD) age of 66±9 years and a mean forced expiratory volume in 1 s of 0.72±0.40 L participated. Among the 25 patients completing the program, adherence was 76%, with a mean attendance rate of 64±35%. Mean dyspnea score was 1.5±1.1 before and 3.2±1.2 after exercise. Mean oxygen saturation changed from 94±3% to 91±5% (P<0.001), while heart rate increased from 88±15 beats/min to 102±18 beats/min (P<0.001). One patient reported chest painrequiring nitroglycerin spray and five experienced transient desaturation below 85% with play. Patients enjoyed the program (visual analogue score 8±2.6/10) and most would highly recommend it to others. Conclusions: Moderate exercise using a VGS was safe, feasible and enjoyed as an adjunct to inpatient PR. This modality may encourage patients to maintain physical activity after PR. © 2013 Pulsus Group Inc.",pmid,24093115,Scopus,Canadian Respiratory Journal,"Wardini R., Dajczman E., Yang N., Baltzan M., Préfontaine D., Stathatos M., Marciano H., Watson S., Wolkove N.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,You Can't Take It With You? Effects Of Handheld Portable Media Consoles On Physiological And Psychological Responses To Video Game And Movie Content.,"Portable media consoles are becoming extremely popular devices for viewing a number of different types of media content, both for entertainment and for educational purposes. Given the increasingly heavy use of portable consoles as an alternative to traditional television-style monitors, it is important to investigate how physiological and psychological effects of portable consoles may differ from those of television-based consoles, because such differences in physiological and psychological responses may precipitate differences in the delivered content's effectiveness. Because portable consoles are popular as a delivery system for multiple types of media content, such as movies and video games, it is also important to investigate whether differences between the effects of portable and television-based consoles are consistent across multiple types of media. This article reports a 2 x 2 (console: portable or television-based x medium: video game or movie) mixed factorial design experiment with physiological arousal and self-reported flow experience as dependent variables, designed to explore whether console type affects media experiences and whether these effects are consistent across different media. Results indicate that portable media consoles evoke lower levels of physiological arousal and flow experience and that this effect is consistent for both video games and movies. These findings suggest that even though portable media consoles are often convenient compared to television-based consoles, the convenience may come at a cost in terms of the user experience.",pmid,19445637,Scopus,"Cyberpsychology & behavior : the impact of the Internet, multimedia and virtual reality on behavior and society","Ivory J.D., Magee R.G.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,A Method To Evaluate Emotions In Educational Video Games For Children,"Although several evaluation analyses have recently been proposed to assess the user or player experience of playing a video game, we found the need for these to be adapted when we wanted to apply them to young children. However, young children are unable to spend a long time grading many attributes or indexes after playing. Thus, selecting the most important aspects to be analyzed is required in order to perform a non-time consuming and significant evaluation method to be used with children. Hence, this work is focused on designing an evaluation method to assess emotions when young children (3-5 years old) play a video game. In particular, we are interested in educational video games because of the importance that emotion has in motivation, which in turn is highly important in education. Although the method presented follows the pre-test, test and post-test classic structure, the activities carried out in each of these phases have been modified to, firstly, include no elements which require reading-writing skills, which are as yet undeveloped at this age and, secondly, to limit the emotional impact that children can suffer when they are aware that they are being evaluated. We have applied the proposed method in a sample of 39 children playing the educational video game ""Ato's Adventure"", which was in its final development phases, obtaining very promising results both for the analysis method and for the video game. © J.UCS.",eid,2-s2.0-84882967322,Scopus,Journal of Universal Computer Science,"Padilla-Zea N., López-Arcos J.R., González Sánchez J.L., Gutiérrez Vela F.L., Abad-Arranz A.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,A Review On Affective Computing,"Emotion plays major role in human life. Based on emotions we are changing our decisions day today life.

,Appraisal Of Emotions From Resources,"There have been tremendous advances in video-game graphics leading to realistic looking characters in many modern AAA titles. Unfortunately, the realistic looks do not always come with believable behavior of non-playable character AI. In particular, AI-driven video-game characters do not show plausible emotional reactions to interactions with the player unless they are hand-scripted for the particular encounter. We propose a light-weight algorithm for automatic generation of NPC emotional reactions at the level of actions and at the level of appearances. To do so adapt a recent resource-driven emotion model to generate NPC actions and extend it with a simple appraisal mechanism to explicitly compute emotional descriptors. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014",eid,2-s2.0-84921388304,Scopus,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),"Manavalan Y.B., Bulitko V.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas

,Cloud Gate: Challenging Reproducibility,"Jessica Litman argues that the basic reproductive unit of U.S. copyright law, the copy, ""no longer serves our needs, and we should jettison it completely"" (180). The challenge posed by modern technologies is central to her argument. Computers routinely produce ""copies"" of program code and data in use. Litman suggests that use-distinguished as commercial or noncommercial- would be a better way of organizing copyright legislation. But use is a complex and nuanced term, especially when applied to one ubiquitous reproductive technology, photography. Photography can be described as a group of technologies with multiple uses. Reproduction, in the sense of making copies, is only one aspect. For the average snapshooter, a photograph of a relative is not used to ""copy"" them, but rather to depict a likeness as a trigger for memories. Industrial uses of photography are different. Large-scale integrated circuits are fabricated using photographic technologies. Dark and light areas in a negative detect if a resistant mask should be deposited; the negative presents a mapped description of circuit pathways. Much like the copies found in computer program code, reproduction occurs without recognizable depiction. The photographic functions of reproduction, depiction, and detection are separate (Maynard, Engine and ""Talbot's Techonologies""). I agree with Litman's contention that the term copy has lost its utility, not merely because of digital technology, but because of technology in the broadest sense. Distinguishing between description and depiction differentiates between the ""copies"" computers use and copies as reproductions. The transitory ""copies"" of data present in digital technology are sets of instructions describing a tangible or ephemeral object-music, pictures, and words. Like the photographic negatives used to manufacture integrated circuits or circuit boards, the copied data tells machines how to reproduce objects. It neither depicts, nor reproduces them. These subtle distinctions are present in U.S. copyright law, but only in regard to architecture. Descriptions of buildings, in the form of plans, can be copyrighted.1 However, 17 U.S.C. §120(a) provides for a right of depiction: (a) Pictorial Representations Permitted.-The copyright in an architectural work that has been constructed does not include the right to prevent the making, distributing, or public display of pictures, paintings, photographs, or other pictorial representations of the work, if the building in which the work is embodied is located in or ordinarily visible from a public place. This right only extends to architecture; no other category in copyright law offers similar exclusions. The statute uses the term ""representation"" rather than depiction and only concerns pictorial representations. Nonetheless, U.S.C. 17 §120(a) differentiates between representation and reproduction and classifies photography among representative technologies. Photography's depictive power is often conflated with the descriptiveness of its reproductions. Its ability to describe physical objects into twodimensional projections is unparalleled. Photographs ""tell"" us things about the subject, but also provide raw material for imagination. A photograph is not a ""copy"" of its subject. I am sympathetic to Kendall L. Walton's controversial assertion that depictive photographs are essentially fictions facilitating imagination. ""To be a depiction is to have the function of serving as a prop in visual games of make believe"" (Walton, Mimesis 296). A depiction does more than ""copy"" reality. Nonetheless, because of the power of its descriptions, photography is more suspect than painting or sketching. A person sketching a public landmark is less likely to be interrogated than a person with a camera. The right to photograph in public does not exist by statute, except in the case of architecture. Following a 2005 controversy regarding Anish Kapoor's sculpture Cloud Gate, this chapter revisits the concept of reproducibility in art. Kapoor's sculpture captured the imagination of Internet users who warned of a new prohibition of photography taking hold. Though Walter Benjamin's ""The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction"" loses some of its prophetic luster in the aftermath of Cloud Gate, most of the mechanisms involved remain relevant. As a monument to capitalism and a ""copyrightable"" property, the sculpture provides a locus for discussing the right to photograph in public spaces and the use of media, both new and old. © 2008 by University of Michigan Press.

,Comparison Of Rates Of Perceived Exertion Between Active Video Games And Traditional Exercise,"Background: Research regarding the Nintendo Wii™ has focused on rehabilitation and balance benefits as well as energy expenditure for games such as boxing and tennis. There is a gap, however, in the literature regarding perceived exertion of the Wii™ compared to other modes of exercise. Research question: The purpose of this laboratory-based study was to compare perceived exertion on the Nintendo Wii™ and two traditional modes of exercise: the treadmill and cycle ergometer. It was expected that the Wii™ would show lower ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) values. Type of study: A repeated measures design was used. Methods: Five healthy males (average age = 21.4 years) and seven females (average age = 22.1 years) completed three 20 minute exercise sessions in random order, one each using the cycle ergometer, the treadmill and the Nintendo Wii Fit Plus™. Exercise intensity was fixed at 65% (± 5 bpm) of each participant's age predicted maximum heart rate. Ratings of perceived exertion and HR were measured every minute. Additionally overall RPE was collected at the end of each trial. Results: Repeated measures analysis of variance confirmed that although exercise intensity was consistent across the three exercise methods, overall RPE was lowest for the Nintendo Wii™ (9.50) followed by the treadmill (9.92) and finally the cycle ergometer (11.08), F (1,11) = 10.17, p&lt;0.01.

,Digital Games And Beyond: What Happens When Players Compete?,"Because digital games are fun, engaging, and popular, organizations are attempting to integrate them within organizational activities as serious components, with the anticipation that they can improve employees' motivation and performance. But in order to do so and to obtain the intended outcomes, it is necessary to first obtain an understanding of how different digital game designs impact players' behaviors and emotional responses. Hence, in this study, we address one key element of popular game designs: competition. Using extant research on tournaments and intrinsic motivation, we model competitive games as a skill-based tournament and conduct an experimental study to understand player behaviors and emotional responses under different competition conditions. When players compete with players of similar skill levels, they apply more effort as indicated by more games played and longer duration of play. But when players compete with players of lower skill levels, they report higher levels of enjoyment and lower levels of arousal after game-playing. We discuss the implications for organizations seeking to introduce games premised on competition and provide a framework to guide information system researchers to embark on a study of games.

,"Eeg, Hrv And Psychological Correlates While Playing Bejeweled Ii: A Randomized Controlled Study","Stress related medical disorders such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, depression, and anxiety are serious medical issues that can cause disability and death. Interventions to prevent their development and exacerbation are needed. Casual video games (CVGs) are fun, easy to play, spontaneous and tremendously popular. People report that they play these games because they decrease their stress and improve their mood. This study tested this theory by comparing people playing Bejeweled II a popular CVG with control subjects measured under similar conditions. Electroencephalographic (EEG) changes after playing Bejeweled II were consistent with increased mood and corroborated with similar findings on psychological reports. Moreover, heart rate variability (HRV) changes consistent with autonomic nervous system relaxation or decreased physical stress were also recorded.

,"Effects Of Violent Versus Nonviolent Video Games On Children's Arousal, Aggressive Mood, And Positive Mood","This study investigated the relationship between violent video games and children's mood. A total of 71 children aged 8 to 12 years played a paper-and-pencil game, a nonviolent video game, and a violent video game. Results indicate that arousal, as measured by heart rate and self-reported arousal, increased significantly after playing the violent video game, as compared with the other two game conditions, with girls reporting more arousal than did boys. There was no significant increase in aggressive mood scores for either boys or girls after playing the violent game. Positive mood, as measured by positive affect, showed no significant increases or decreases after playing either video game. However, positive mood, as measured by general mood, showed a significant increase after playing the violent game for both boys and girls, but only as compared with the paper-and-pencil game. Results are interpreted in terms of social learning and cognitive information processing theories of aggression.",eid,2-s2.0-0035492307,Scopus,Journal of Applied Social Psychology,"Fleming M.J., Rickwood D.J.",2001,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas

,Emotionally Expressive Agents,"The ability to express emotions is important for creating believable interactive characters. To simulate emotional expressions in an interactive environment, an intelligent agent needs both an adaptive model for generating believable responses, and a visualization model for mapping emotions into facial expressions. Recent advances in intelligent agents and in facial modeling have produced effective algorithms for these tasks independently. In this paper, we describe a method for integrating these algorithms to create an interactive simulation of an agent that produces appropriate facial expressions in a dynamic environment. Our approach to combining a model of emotions with a facial model represents a first step towards developing the technology of a truly believable interactive agent, which has a wide range of applications from designing intelligent training systems to video games and animation tools.",eid,2-s2.0-0032591828,Scopus,"Computer Animation, Conference Proceedings","El-Nasr Magy Seif, Ioerger Thomas R., Yen John, House Donald H., Parke Frederic I.",1999,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Facing Facts: Best Practices For Common Uses Of Facial Recognition Technologies,"In the 2002 film Minority Report, Steven Spielberg imagined a world in which companies use biometric technology to identify us and serve us targeted ads. Ten years later, that vision is coming closer to reality. Having overcome the high costs and poor accuracy that once stunted its growth, one form of biometric technology-facial recognition-is quickly moving out of the realm of science fiction and into the commercial marketplace. Today, companies are deploying facial recognition technologies in a wide array of contexts, reflecting a spectrum of increasing technological sophistication. At the simplest level, the technology can be used for facial detection; that is, merely to detect and locate a face in a photo. Current uses of facial detection include refining search engine results to include only those results that contain a face; locating faces in images in order to blur them; ensuring that the frame for a video chat feed actually includes a face; or developing virtual eyeglass fitting systems and virtual makeover tools that allow consumers to upload their photos online and ""try on"" a pair of glasses or a new hairstyle. A more refined version of facial recognition technology allows companies to assess characteristics of facial images. For instance, companies can identify moods or emotions from facial expressions to determine a player's engagement with a video game or a viewer's excitement during a movie. Companies can also place cameras into digital signs to determine the demographic characteristics of a face-such as age range and gender-and deliver targeted advertisements in real-time in retail spaces. In the most advanced application, companies can use the technology to compare individuals' facial characteristics across different images in order to identify them. In this application, an image of an individual is matched with another image of the same individual. If the face in either of the two images is identified-that is, the name of the individual is known-then, in addition to being able to demonstrate a match between two faces, the technology can be used to identify previously anonymous faces. This is the use of facial recognition that potentially raises the most serious privacy concerns because it can identify anonymous individuals in images. One prevalent current use of this application is to enable semi-automated photo tagging or photo organization on social networks and in photo management applications. On social networks this feature typically works by scanning new photos a user uploads against existing ""tagged"" photos. The social network then identifies the user's ""friends"" in the new photos so the user can tag them. On December 8, 2011, the Federal Trade Commission (""FTC"" or ""Commission"") hosted a workshop-""Face Facts: A Forum on Facial Recognition Technology"" (""Face Facts workshop"")-to explore developments in this rapidly evolving field. Panelists discussed a number of issues, including: recent advances in facial recognition technologies; current and possible future commercial uses of facial recognition technologies; ways consumers can benefit from these uses; and privacy and security concerns raised. Following the workshop, the FTC received eighty public comments discussing these issues from private citizens, industry representatives, trade groups, consumer and privacy advocates, think tanks, and members of Congress. In this report, FTC staff has synthesized those discussions and comments in order to develop recommended best practices for protecting consumer privacy in this area, while promoting innovation. To begin, staff recommends that companies using facial recognition technologies design their services with privacy in mind, that is, by implementing ""privacy by design,"" in a number of ways. First, companies should maintain reasonable data security protections for consumers' images and the biometric information collected from those images to enable facial recognition (for example, unique measurements such as size of features or distance between the eyes or the ears). As the increasing public availability of identified images online has been a major factor in the increasing commercial viability of facial recognition technologies, companies that store such images should consider putting protections in place that would prevent unauthorized scraping which can lead to unintended secondary uses. Second, companies should establish and maintain appropriate retention and disposal practices for the consumer images and biometric data that they collect. For example, if a consumer creates an account on a website that allows her to virtually ""try on"" eyeglasses, uploads photos to that website, and then later deletes her account on the website, the photos are no longer necessary and should be discarded. Third, companies should consider the sensitivity of information when developing their facial recognition products and services. For instance, companies developing digital signs equipped with cameras using facial recognition technologies should consider carefully where to place such signs and avoid placing them in sensitive areas, such as bathrooms, locker rooms, health care facilities, or places where children congregate. Staff also recommends several ways for companies using facial recognition technologies to provide consumers with simplified choices and increase the transparency of their practices. For example, companies using digital signs capable of demographic detection-which often look no different than digital signs that do not contain cameras-should provide clear notice to consumers that the technologies are in use, before consumers come into contact with the signs. Similarly, social networks using a facial recognition feature should provide users with a clear notice-outside of a privacy policy-about how the feature works, what data it collects, and how it will use the data. Social networks should also provide consumers with (1) an easy to find, meaningful choice not to have their biometric data collected and used for facial recognition; and (2) the ability to turn off the feature at any time and delete any biometric data previously collected from their tagged photos. Finally, there are at least two scenarios in which companies should obtain consumers' affirmative express consent before collecting or using biometric data from facial images. First, they should obtain a consumer's affirmative express consent before using a consumer's image or any biometric data derived from that image in a materially different manner than they represented when they collected the data. Second, companies should not use facial recognition to identify anonymous images of a consumer to someone who could not otherwise identify him or her, without obtaining the consumer's affirmative express consent. Consider the example of a mobile app that allows users to identify strangers in public places, such as on the street or in a bar. If such an app were to exist, a stranger could surreptitiously use the camera on his mobile phone to take a photo of an individual who is walking to work or meeting a friend for a drink and learn that individual's identity-and possibly more information, such as her address-without the individual even being aware that her photo was taken. Given the significant privacy and safety risks that such an app would raise, only consumers who have affirmatively chosen to participate in such a system should be identified. The recommended best practices contained in this report are intended to provide guidance to commercial entities that are using or plan to use facial recognition technologies in their products and services. However, to the extent the recommended best practices go beyond existing legal requirements, they are not intended to serve as a template for law enforcement actions or regulations under laws currently enforced by the FTC. If companies consider the issues of privacy by design, meaningful choice, and transparency at this early stage, it will help ensure that this industry develops in a way that encourages companies to offer innovative new benefits to consumers and respect their privacy interests. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

,"Faunal Assemblage Structure On The Patton Seamount (Gulf Of Alaska, Usa)","Epibenthic and demersal assemblages of fish and invertebrates on the Patton Seamount in the Gulf of Alaska, U.S.A., were studied in July 1999 using the Deep Sea Research Vehicle Alvin. Faunal associations with depth were described using video analysis of 8 dives from 151 to 3,375 m. A cluster analysis applied to the observations suggests three benthic faunal communities based on depth: 1) a shallow-water community (151-950 m) consisting mainly of rockfishes, flatfishes, sea stars, and attached suspension feeders, 2) a mid-depth community (400-1500 m) also consisting of numerous attached suspension-feeding organisms such as corals, sponges, crinoids, sea anemones, and sea cucumbers and fish such as the sablefish Anoplopoma fimbria and the giant grenadier Albatrossia pectoralis both of which were aggregated over a relatively narrow depth range, and 3) a deep-water community (500-3,375 m) consisting of fewer attached suspension feeders and more highly mobile species such as the Pacific grenadier Coryphaenoides acrolepis, popeye grenadier C. cinereus, Pacific flatnose Antimora microlepis, and large mobile crabs Macroregonia macrochira and Chionoecetes spp. that were less aggregated and covered a much greater depth range. Bottom depth was highly correlated with temperature and bottom substratum type where the upper 1,300 m was primarily a mixed habitat of boulders and large cobbles. The bottom substratum types were less diverse from 1,300 m to 3,300 m, which was composed of gravels and smaller sized particles. The absence of many near shore species on the Patton Seamount suggests this seamount is a unique subset of the near shore fauna but maintains distinct assemblage characteristics.

,Fit For Play: A Proof Of Concept In Computer Games For Health,"One of the biggest problems in today's society is promotion of health. How do we as responsible parents, governments etc promote good health when there appears to be an ever growing tendency away from active sports towards more sedentary entertainments such as TV, Internet and computer games? Indeed some researchers argue that the popularity of computer games can be cited as a contributing factor to the higher percentage in obesity amongst adolescents. There is some evidence that the intrinsic appeal of computer games lures individuals into sedentary game playing as an alternative to other activities of a more physical nature e.g. sport. An alternate view is that the infrastructure of computer games technology presents the individual game player with a wider range of opportunities than those afforded by traditional sports (e.g. control, participation, social constructs etc). An initial study highlights the possible contribution of computer games as physical activity specialists. In order to substantiate this possible avenue of research a series of ad hoc experiments have been carried out utilising fitness metrics such as heart rate and blood pressure in a variety of scenarios. Although the sample tested was small and in no way indicates a rigorous medical field trial, the results indicate that this approach could yield a new paradigm in the battle to combat such conditions as obesity and coronary heart disease.",eid,2-s2.0-24644511811,Scopus,WSEAS Transactions on Computers,"Chandler C., Noriega L.",2005,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Gender Of Opponent And Type A Competitiveness Predict Cardiovascular Responses During Competition,"We investigated associations between components of Type A behavior, assessed with the student version of the Jenkins Activity Survey, and cardiovascular reactivity in young men and women. Men competed on a video game task against the machine or against men or women; women competed against the machine or against men. Reactivity differed Utile between the genders and was generally higher during competition against a man than during competition against the machine, regardless of Type A component scores. Reactivity was greater in men who scored higher on the hard-driving/competitive component when the opponent was a woman. These findings are explained in tenus of arousal associated with competitive engagement and attitudes about competition against men and women. Neither the speed/impatience scale, nor the total Type A measure was consistently related to cardiovascular reactivity. © 1996 Select Press.",eid,2-s2.0-24044546213,Scopus,Journal of Social Behavior and Personality,"Felsten G., Leitten C.L.",1996,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,"In Narrow Heart Vessels, Catheter Device Prevails","Nearly everyone reading this column has used a joystick remote control to play a video game. Weaving a player through a dangerous maze of obstacles and around corners seeking to damage or destroy the enemy in an effort to win the game is a great form of entertainment, but for some of us, a similar technique may one day save our lives. Nearly 90,000 Americans are diagnosed with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) per year. This heart rhythm can drive the heart to beat up to 200 beats per minute and cause shortness of breath, chest pain, and lightheadedness. There are several subclasses of SVT, with the most common being atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT) and atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia (AVRT). Each of these has an abrupt onset and endpoint and when accompanied by unhealthy coronary arteries can cause chest pain and, potentially, an acute cardiac event. SVT is about twice as common in women as it is in men and the condition is generally thought to arise because of a person's anatomy, that is, there is more than one electrical pathway carrying the electrical impulse from the atrium to the ventricle. If a beat occurs at an incorrect time, the two different pathways cause a circular transmission of the impulse that in turn causes the rapid heart beat. ©MediMedia USA.",eid,2-s2.0-70349558544,Scopus,Managed Care,Morrow T.,2009,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Kapean: Understanding Affective States Of Children With Adhd,"Affective computing seeks to create computational systems that adapt content and resources according to the affective states of the users. However, the detection of the user's affection such as motivation and emotion is challenging especially when an attention problem is present. An approach to convey learning resources to children with learning problems is by means of game-based tools. The first step towards building these ludic experiences is to identify the skills and limitations of potential users. In this work we describe a case based study carried out to observe and get understanding of the level of attention, cognition and memory of children with ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder). Fifteen children were invited to play physical and digital versions of the Stroop and Flanker tests as well as memory-based games. The interaction with KAPEAN is allowed with both a mouse and a hand gestures recognition device. To collect data from the user's experiences the system integrates a webcam, a Microsoft Kinect device, a video camera, and an Emotiv EEG headset. Data was analyzed offline in order to study which affective states are present while children with ADHD played with KAPEAN.",eid,2-s2.0-84964543883,Scopus,Educational Technology and Society,"Martínez F., Barraza C., González N., González J.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Limits Of Economic And Strategic Rationality For Agents And Ma Systems,"AI adoption of the game-theoretic paradigm although motivated and productive, suffers from basic limits for modelling autonomous agents and MA systems. First, we briefly restate game-theory's role for DAI and MAS: the introduction of formal prototypical social situations (""games""); the use of formal and sound notions, a self-interested view of autonomous agents, etc. Then, a number of criticisms, that have an impact on modelling intelligent social/individual action, are examined: the economicist interpretation of rationality; its instrumentalist conception, which leaves implicit the ends of agents' choices; the consequent multiple equilibria allowed by the theory; the context-unboundedness of rationality. Some contributions for a more heterarchic, context-bounded, architecture of rational agent are given, and a goal-based strategy, as distinct from a strictly utilitarian principle of decision-making, is proposed. Troubles of game-theory with multi-agent systems and in particular with modelling ""cooperation"" are outlined. Finally, some limits inherent in the notion of ""incentive engineering"" are pointed out. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

,Prediction Of Resting Cardiovascular Functioning In Youth With Family Histories Of Essential Hypertension: A 5-Year Follow-Up,"Two hundred forty-six children (96 Whites, of whom 51 were males; 150 African-Americans, of whom 69 were males) with a familial history of essential hypertension (EH) were re-evaluated 5 years after an initial evaluation. During the initial visit, anthropometric, demographic, and resting cardiovascular (CV) parameters (designated initial baseline levels) were assessed. These CV parameters (systolic and diastolic blood pressure [BP], heart rate, cardiac output index [CI], and total peripheral resistance index [TPRI]) were also measured during postural challenge, a video game challenge, and a cold pressor task. At follow-up, resting CV parameters were again evaluated, and designated as follow-up resting levels. Moderate temporal stability (r range = .43-.56) was observed for all resting CV parameters. Mean stress responses for each CV parameter for all 3 stressors during the initial visit were positively related to the respective CV follow-up resting level. BP stress responses to postural change and video game challenge were found to be significant independent predictors of future resting BP after controlling for standard EH risk factors. Follow-up resting CI was not predicted by any stress responses, whereas follow-up resting TPRI was predicted by TPRI responses to the video game after controlling for standard EH risk factors. These results contrast with those from an earlier 1-year follow-up, where stress responses for neither CI nor TPRI predicted follow-up resting levels. It appears that, as children get older, TPRI stress responses play a stronger role in vasoconstrictive function.",eid,2-s2.0-0000141459,Scopus,International Journal of Behavioral Medicine,"Treiber F.A., Turner J.R., Davis H., Strong W.B.",1997,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Quaternions - Correcting For Geometric Distortion In Dynamic Seismic And Satellite Testing,"Seismic testing sometimes requires significant roll, pitch, and yaw rotations from their MDOF vibration test systems when reproducing certain reference waveform vectors on seismic tables that are associated with particular seismic environments. When these reference waveforms (typically accelerations) are used for such testing, significant rotational motion of the test system's shake table can occur. As a result, the X, Y, and Z control transducers that are mounted on the surface of the table will no longer be aligned with the world (fixed) coordinate system as the table rotates about X, Y, and Z, but rather with respect to the shake table's body (moving) coordinate system. This lack of alignment with respect to the world coordinate system in turn causes geometric distortion in the output of the control accelerometers that are required to control such MDOF tests. These errors can cause further errors in the control system's ability to reproduce the motion specified by the test's reference waveforms with respect to the world coordinate system as required by the seismic test specifications. Similar problems can also occur in other such applications of MDOF testing with reference acceleration waveforms that similarly produces significant roll, pitch, or yaw rotations with their tests. This article presents methods based on the use of quaternions to correct the resulting control transducer measurement distortions. Quaternions are also used widely in physics, guidance and control, kinematics, robotics, autonomous cars, video games, and general graphics applications.",eid,2-s2.0-84950269816,Scopus,Sound and Vibration,Underwood M.A.,2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas

,Single-Switch Control Versus Powered Wheelchair For Training Cause-Effect Relationships: Case Studies,"Objectives. Traditional habilitation recommends the use of single switch control and simple computer games as pre-training of cause-effect relationships and joystick control before training in use of a powered wheelchair. Findings from studies of individuals at an early developmental level driving a powered wheelchair suggest it may be more effective to reverse order. Methods. We studied the outcome of powered wheelchair activity in context (self-directed locomotion). Participants included 40 disabled individuals and 17 typically developed infants functioning at an early developmental level. The activity in the wheelchair was paralleled with the use of single switch controls connected both to toys and to a computer with simple 'press-action' software. Results. The cognitive understanding of the simple cause-effect (use of joystick causes the effect of motion of the wheelchair) developed earlier than the understanding (press on single switch causes activation of toy or apparatus). Conclusion. The recommendation to use single switch controls as pre-training for driving a powered wheelchair corresponds with individuals with quite good cognitive function but not with individuals who function at an early developmental level. For individuals with severe or profound mental retardation the possibilities to understand cause-effect relationships are found in tools that affect all their senses, their whole body. A powered wheelchair is such a tool. When the individual activates the joystick, the wheelchair moves, affecting all senses and the individual's position in space. This event provides arousal, interest and motivation to further manipulate and explore the cause of the effect.",eid,2-s2.0-0033500452,Scopus,Technology and Disability,"Nilsson L., Nyberg P.",1999,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas

Asking the salesperson to set each TV to similar levels of color temperature, brightness, and other picture variables can also prove helpful in determining the HDTV's quality. The quality to be looked at includes picture quality at wide angles, smoothness of motion in action scenes and video games, brightness and contrast, color saturation and accuracy, etc. Local delivery of HDTV is better, as large TV sets can easily be damaged in transit.

,The Integrated Model Of (Dys-) Functionality: Reconstructing Patterns Of Gaming As Self-Medication In Biographical Interviews With Video Game Addicts,"We aim to build a new theory of highly committed problematic video gaming based on rich qualitative data and to compare it to existing theories. To do this, we used hermeneutic analytical methods and grounded theory methodology to analyze 125 hours of recording from 42 biographical interviews, 23 of them with long-term follow-up. Participants were addicted (ex-) gamers according to screening instruments, aged 16 to 44, 29 males and 13 females.The integrated (dys-) functionality model shows in-game behavior of participants to be dysfunctional in that it hinders advancement in several distinguishable real-life biographical quests (for success, for belonging, and for autonomy) and at the same time functional in that it matches these quests. The model integrates two seemingly irreconcilable research traditions: The addiction/disease model in medical-psychological research investigates dysfunctionality of gaming in pathological gamers. Game studies focus on functionality of in-game behavior and establish gamer typologies based on gaming motives. By adding the biographical context to game studies, but keeping the gamer's perspective, we show that gamers whose lives become dominated by gaming may know what they want and “virtually” get it, but still not “really” get it in the long term. “Compensatory” gaming does not, thus, equal unproblematic or “non-addicted” gaming. © 2015, Inst. fur Klinische Psychologie und Gemeindepsychologie.

,Using Reactive And Adaptive Behaviors To Play Soccer,"This work deals with designing simple behaviors to allow quadruped robots to play soccer. The robots are fully autonomous; they cannot exchange messages between each other. They are equipped with a charge-coupled-device camera that allows them to detect objects in the scene. In addition to vision problems such as changing lighting conditions and color confusion, legged robots must cope with 'bouncing images' because of successive legs hitting the ground. When defining task-driven strategies, the designer has to take into account the influences of the locomotion and vision systems on the behavior. Locomotion and vision skills should be made as reliable as possible.

,"Watching Handball Transmissions: Experiences Of Autonomy, Competency And Relatedness","The current article presents a qualitative study of Danish television viewer's reception of Danish handball transmissions. The overall aim of the study has been to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of televised sport as a specific kind of television entertainment. The analysis shows that, due to the dramaturgic structure of handball transmissions, viewers consider such transmissions particularly reliable and effective sources of entertainment. The transmissions' entertainment value derives from their specific ability to give the viewers a complex experience of feeling autonomous and competent when mastering the game and in relation to others. The study shows that entertainment concerns both affective involvement and identity formation, as social and cultural meaning seem to be at the root of involvement. Even though both men and women find great joy in the transmissions, their viewing is embedded in quite diverse patterns regarding additional media use. This points to gendered differences regarding how the entertaining experience is basically received and the qualities sought and pursued in the transmissions.",eid,2-s2.0-77957137393,Scopus,Nordicom Review,Frandsen K.,2010,Article,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,'U Got 2 Move It' Pilot Study: Impact Of An After-School Interactive Video Exertainment Program For Underserved Children.,"Background. The prevalence of childhood overweight in the United States has increased by 50% in the last two decades (Schumann, Nichols X Lingston, 2002) and 25% to 30% of U.S. children between the ages of 6 and 17 are obese (Moran, 1999). Several studies show that sedentary activities such as television viewing, using a computer, and playing video games increase the risk of childhood obesity (Ebbeling, Pawlak & Ludwig, 2002; Dennison, Erb & Jenkins, 2002; Yackel, 2003). An innovative means of reducing sedentary activity in children through the use of video 'exergames' or 'exertainment' is becoming a popular means of increasing physical activity in children. A limited number of studies show that 'exergames' can make a positive contribution to players'stress management, weight management, fitness, and health (Lieberman, 2006). More research is needed to determine if and how these interactive video games improve physical activity and overall health in children at high risk for obesity. Purpose. The purpose of this pilot study was to assess the effects of a four-week interactive video 'exertainment' program in underserved children, as part of an after-school program based on social cognitive theory. Method. Participants consisted of 58 children recruited from an existing after-school program in the San Bernardino City Unified School District. The participants were children ages 7-12 years of lower socioeconomic status living in Southern California. Pre- and post-assessments were made to see if there were improvements in attitude, self-efficacy, outcome expectations, body composition, cardiovascular endurance, body image, physical activity outside the intervention, absenteeism, and academic achievement. Analyses. Results from this study showed that there was a 16% decrease in resting heart rate from baseline to post-intervention for males (p= < =.001) and a 12.9% decrease in resting heart rate for females (p= < =.001). Average active heart rate decreased for all subjects post-intervention representing at 7.16% decrease for males (p=041) and 5.2% decrease for females ( p=053). Absenteeism rates improved significantly for students participating in the intervention. The mean number of days students were absent during the intervention (3.73, p=020) decreased compared to prior to starting the intervention (000, p=000). Academic scores showed significant improvements in the students' mean math performance while participating in the intervention (t=3.63, p=001) compared to non-participants (t=2.16, p=.042). The average percent body fat in males showed a non-significant decrease by less than 1% (-.89, p=.295). There were no significant changes on the other study variables. Application to Health Education. The 'U Got 2 Move It' program focused on promoting healthy lifestyle modifications in America's youth as a means of reducing the risk of obesity in underserved children by introducing an appealing format for activity--interactive video games in after-school programs. The results from this pilot test will serve as a model for health educators to partner with schools and community-based organizations to develop future health-related programs focusing on preventing or reducing the threat of obesity and related health problems in high risk children.",pq_id,33710735,proquest_dt,NA,"Young, Tammy L",2007,THES,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Automated Negotiations Among Autonomous Agents In Negotiation Networks.,"Distributed software systems are a norm in today's computing environment. These systems typically comprise of many autonomous components that interact with each other and negotiate to accomplish joint tasks. Today, we can integrate potentially disparate components such that they act coherently by coordinating their actions via message exchanges. Once this integration issue is resolved, the next big challenge in computing is the automation of the negotiation process between the various system components. In this dissertation, we address this automated negotiation problem in environments where there is a conflict of interest among the system components. We present our negotiation model - a negotiation network - where a software system is a network of agents representing individual components in the system. We analyze the software system as a characteristic form game, one of many concepts in this dissertation borrowed from game theory. The agents in our model preserve the self-interest of the components they represent (their owners), and make decisions that maximize the expected utilities of their owners. These agents accomplish joint tasks by forming coalitions. We show that the problem of computing the optimal solution, where the utilities of all agents are maximized, is hyper-exponential in complexity. We present an approximate algorithm for this hard problem, and evaluate it empirically. The simulation results show that our algorithm has many desirable properties - it is distributed, efficient, stable, scalable, and simple. Our algorithm produces the optimal (social welfare maximizing) solution for 96% of cases, generates maximal global revenue for 97% of cases, converges to 90% of the best found allocation after only 10 rounds of negotiation, and finds a core-stable solution for revenue distribution among the agents for cases with nonempty core. Finally, to ensure stability for all cases, we present a sliding-window algorithm that computes the nucleolus-stable solution under all situations.",pq_id,33938963,proquest_dt,NA,"Goradia, Hrishikesh J",2007,THES,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Hierarchical Goal Networks: Formalisms And Algorithms For Planning And Acting,"In real-world applications of AI and automation such as in robotics, computer game playing and web-services, agents need to make decisions in unstructured environments that are open-world, dynamic and partially observable. In the AI and Robotics research communities in particular, there is much interest in equipping robots to operate with minimal human intervention in diverse scenarios such as in manufacturing plants, homes, hospitals, etc. Enabling agents to operate in these environments requires advanced planning and acting capabilities, some of which are not well supported by the current state of the art automated planning formalisms and algorithms. To address this problem, in my thesis I propose a new planning formalism that addresses some of the inadequacies in current planning frameworks, and a suite of planning and acting algorithms that operate under this planning framework.   The main contributions of this thesis are: - Hierarchical Goal Network (HGN) Planning Formalism. This planning  formalism combines aspects (and therefore harnesses advantages) of Classical Planning and Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) Planning, two of the most prominent planning formalisms currently in use. In particular, HGN planning algorithms, while retaining the efficiency and scalability advantages of HTNs, also allows incorporation of heuristics and other reasoning techniques from Classical Planning. -  Planning Algorithms. Goal Decomposition  Planner (GDP) and the Goal Decomposition with Landmarks (GoDeL) planner are two HGN planning algorithms that combines hierarchical decomposition with classical planning heuristics to outperform state-of-the-art HTN planners like SHOP and SHOP2. -  Integration with Robotics. The Combined HGN and Motion Planning (CHaMP) algorithm integrates GoDeL with low-level motion and manipulation planning algorithms in Robotics to generate plans directly executable by robots.   Given the need for autonomous agents to operate in open, dynamic and unstructured environments and the obvious need for high-level deliberation capabilities to enable intelligent behavior, the planning-and-acting systems that are developed as part of this thesis may provide unique insights into ways to realize these systems in the real world.",pq_id,1708665164,proquest_dt,NA,"Shivashankar, Vikas",2015,THES,Ph.D.,reviewer2,Tamas
,Human Control Of Cooperating Robots,"Advances in robotic technologies and artificial intelligence are allowing robots to emerge from research laboratories into our lives. Experiences with field applications show that we have underestimated the importance of human-robot interaction (HRI) and that new problems arise in HRI as robotic technologies expand. This thesis classifies HRI along four dimensions—human, robot, task, and world and illustrates that previous HRI classifications can be successfully interpreted as either about one of these elements or about the relationship between two or more of these elements. Current HRI studies of single-operator single-robot (SOSR) control and single-operator multiple-robots (SOMR) control are reviewed using this approach.    Human control of multiple robots has been suggested as a way to improve effectiveness in robot control. Unlike previous studies that investigated human interaction either in low-fidelity simulations or based on simple tasks, this thesis investigates human interaction with cooperating robot teams within a realistically complex environment. USARSim, a high-fidelity game-engine-based robot simulator, and MrCS, a distributed multirobot control system, were developed for this purpose. In the pilot experiment, we studied the impact of autonomy level. Mixed initiative control yielded performance superior to fully autonomous and manual control.    To avoid limitation to particular application fields, the present thesis focuses on common HRI evaluations that enable us to analyze HRI effectiveness and guide HRI design independently of the robotic system or application domain. We introduce the interaction episode (IEP), which was inspired by our pilot human-multirobot control experiment, to extend the Neglect Tolerance model to support general multiple robots control for complex tasks. Cooperation Effort (CE), Cooperation Demand (CD), and Team Attention Demand (TAD) are defined to measure the cooperation in SOMR control. Two validation experiments were conducted to validate the CD measurement under tight and weak cooperation conditions in a high-fidelity virtual environment. The results show that CD, as a generic HRI metric, is able to account for the various factors that affect HRI and can be used in HRI evaluation and analysis.",pq_id,304839847,proquest_dt,NA,"Wang, Jijun",2007,THES,Ph.D.,reviewer2,Tamas
,Impact Of Genetic Predisposition And Environmental Stress On Measures Of Preclinical Essential Hypertension,"The main objective of this project was to determine the impact of genetic risk and chronic environmental stress on measures of preclinical essential hypertension (EH) (e.g., exaggerated cardiovascular reactivity, increased resting hemodynamics and increased left ventricular mass [LVM]). A secondary objective was to evaluate the moderating and interactive effects of ethnicity, gender, body mass index [BMI] and anger expression on EH risk indices. Two genes with relevance for blood pressure (BP) control (e.g., beta-2 adrenergic receptor [ADRB2] gene and serotonin transporter [5-HTT] gene) were used to define genetic risk. Chronic environmental stress was assessed by socioeconomic status (SES) and subjective social status (SSS). The project consisted of three sequential studies on a large, multiethnic cohort of young adults (N>500). The first two studies were cross-sectional and based on the analysis of cardiovascular reactivity, resting hemodynamics and LVM data collected at a single visit. The third study was longitudinal and involved the tracking of BP and LVM over a 15-year span from childhood to early adulthood.    In the first study, ADRB2 haplotype significantly interacted with anger suppression in African Americans such that high anger suppressing carriers had the highest resting SBP (p<.05) and TPR reactivity to a cold pressor task (p<.01). In European Americans, ADRB2 haplotype significantly interacted with BMI to predict resting hemodynamics, such that carriers who were high in BMI showed the highest SBP (p<.05). In the second study, a significant interaction between the 5-HTT promoter region polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) and social status was found for cardiovascular reactivity, such that S allele homozygotes who were low in SES and high in SSS exhibited the greatest BP and TPR reactivity to the video game stressor (p-values<.05). No significant interaction was found between 5-HTTLPR and social status in the longitudinal study, however a significant 5-HTTLPR by BMI interaction was determined for LVM, such that obese LL homozygotes had the greatest LVM over time (p<.001). Results from this project expand what is currently known with regard to EH etiology and carry implications for the prevention of EH through the early consideration of genetic, environmental and demographic risk factors.",pq_id,304956392,proquest_dt,NA,"Poole, Joseph Christian",2006,THES,Ph.D.,reviewer2,Tamas
,Isp's Traffic Engineering And Peering Strategy,"The Internet has quickly evolved into a vast global network owned and operated by thousands of interconnected Internet Service Providers. Each of these ISPs, as one autonomous system, has its individual economic interests. ISPs can achieve their objectives through peering strategy  and interdomain traffic engineering. These two issues are important for ISPs' business and have significant implications on the Internet architecture.   Our study on interdomain traffic engineering focuses on AS Path Prepending (ASPP), a popular way for inbound traffic engineering. In order to improve the current situation that ISPs often practise this approach in a trial-and-error basis, we propose a greedy algorithm to help ISPs perform this approach systematically and efficiently. Then we demonstrate two fundamental issues of decentralized selfish traffic engineering, routing instability and  global network performance degradation, based on an abstract model where ISPs perform traffic engineering for their individual load balance. We also present a real-world pathologic case of prepending instability from our measurement study. Some simple guidelines are given for ISPs to avoid such routing instability.   Over the past several years, numerous types of “overlay” networks change the interdomain traffic pattern and ISPs lose the routing control of some interdomain traffic flows due to the application layer routing. As a result, some ISPs may provide unintended transit service for other local ISPs. It upsets the traditional business model and makes ISPs' peering strategies more complicated.   Our work on peering strategy is to help ISPs understand the economic implications of various traffic patterns and make proper decisions to optimize their business. We first conduct an economic analysis for an overlay streaming network to gain some insights on the free ride phenomenon. We further improve the analysis by taking the response of subscribers into consideration and formulate the dynamic market as a multi-leader-follower game to capture the Nash Equilibrium of the routing tussle among the major players of the Internet marketplace. Based on this framework together with a gravity traffic model, we present some important observations on the implications of overlays on ISPs' peering strategy.",pq_id,304719335,proquest_dt,NA,"Wang, Hui",2007,THES,Ph.D.,reviewer2,Tamas
,Motivation And Discourse In A Literate Environment: A Case Study Of A Young Adult Library,"This case study of the Young Adult section of a public library employed the Self-Determination Theory and discourse analysis to determine the elements of the social context that contribute to adolescents’ motivation to read and write, and how the needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness are met as expressed through three adolescents’ literate identities. The two key elements for motivation were found—access to preferred genre and social interaction--while the adolescents demonstrated different needs satisfaction independently and in relationship to the Young Adult section and school contexts. Adolescents’ use of online text was dominated by three types of text—social networking, gaming, and other sites. Teens were found to use the text in their live discourse in five ways: reference, authority, experience, expression, and instrument. This discourse at the computers built friendships and explored sexual identities. The author questions whether incorporation of out-of-school literacies is possible on a broad scale if they are to maintain their attached discourses and meet the teens’ expectations to be prepared for the workplace.",pq_id,304918628,proquest_dt,NA,"Berg, Margaret A.",2009,THES,Ph.D.,reviewer2,Tamas
,On Fundamental Performance Limits Of Delay-Sensitive Wireless Communications,"Mobile traffic is expected to grow at an annual compound rate of 57% from 2014 to 2019, while among the data types that account for this growth mobile video has the highest growth rate. Since a significant portion of mobile video traffic is delay-sensitive, delay-sensitive traffic will play a critical role in future wireless communications. Consequently, future mobile wireless systems will face the dual challenge of supporting large traffic volume while providing reliable service for various kinds of delay-sensitive applications (e.g. real-time conversational video, voice-over-IP (VoIP), and online gaming). Past work on delay-sensitive wireless communications has generally overlooked physical-layer considerations such as modulation and coding scheme (MCS), probability of decoding error, and code blocklength (or coding delay) by employing oversimplified models for the physical-layer. In this dissertation we aim to bridge information theory, communication theory and queueing theory by jointly considering the queueing delay violation probability and the probability of decoding error to identify fundamental trade-offs among wireless system parameters such as MCS, code blocklength, user perceived quality of service, channel fading speed, and average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).    Throughout this dissertation we focus on wireless communication systems where the channel state information (CSI) is available only at the receiver. We model the underlying wireless channel by a finite-state Markov chain (FSMC) where state transitions happen at each transport block (TB) transmission (i.e. TB-based FSMC). First, we focus on communication schemes without feedback and derive the dispersion of the TB-based FSMC model of the Rayleigh fading channel. The TB-based FSMC dispersion is used to characterize the maximum achievable throughput under probability of decoding error and coding delay constraints for a given modulation scheme. Second, we focus on communication schemes with one bit decision-feedback (e.g. acknowledge (ACK)). We introduce a communication scheme, namely early decoding, where the receiver determines the decoding time based on the available CSI. We characterize the maximum achievable throughput of the early decoding scheme under probability of decoding error and coding delay constraints for a given modulation scheme. Then, we derive the dispersion of parallel additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels with finite discrete input alphabets (e.g. pulse amplitude modulation (PAM)). The dispersion of parallel AWGN channels is used to track the operation of incremental redundancy type hybrid automatic repeat request (IR-HARQ) over the Rayleigh fading channel through the HARQ Markov model (HARQ-MM), introduced here. We use the HARQ-MM to characterize the maximum achievable (average) throughput of IR-HARQ under probability of decoding error and coding delay constraints for a given MCS. Third, we focus on a queueing system where data packets arrive at the transmitter, wait in the queue, and are transmitted over the Rayleigh fading channel with IR-HARQ. We invoke a two-dimensional discrete-time Markov process and develop a recursive algorithm to characterize the maximum achievable (average) system throughput for a given MCS under queueing delay violation probability, and probability of decoding error constraints.",pq_id,1753889566,proquest_dt,NA,"Sahin, Cenk",2015,THES,Ph.D.,reviewer2,Tamas
,Physiological Responding In A Two-Dimensional Social Interaction Simulation.,"Although there were no observed effects, several suggestions were made to inform researchers in designing a study of fluid interaction. With the increasing usage of computers in the conduct of research, there is ample evidence to suggest that some emotional or physiological responses may be reliably measured using two-dimensional computer simulations. It was predicted in accordance with the previous aggression literature that when the participant was in the role of aggressor that autonomic nervous system (ANS) responses would decrease as a function of concentration or cognitive load. It was also predicted that when the participant was in the role of virtual victim, a significant increase in ANS function would be observed as a manifestation of the so termed 'flight'response were recruited. A two-dimensional virtual challenge arena was programmed using a video game interface. Fourty-two college students with no prior history of pathology alternatively attacked and defended against an attacker during which, SCL and HR were measured. General recreational data and computer usage as well as valence information was also collected. Results showed that the interaction was rated as 'somewhat pleasant'regardless of which role the participant played. They also rated the conflict as 'somewhat excited' and felt 'mostly in control' of the interaction. Overall the interaction was rated as being, 'slightly unrealistic'. Physiological measurements were made during five discrete phases. Although statistically significant differences were observed between the measurement phases verifying that the phases are likely to be meaningful, there were no reliably significant differences between the different conflict conditions in measuring heart rate and skin conductance. It was proposed that several possibilities, including too complex a measurement design, non-discrete measurement phases and individual variances in acclimation and perceived novelty of the task may have resulted in the failure to find meaningful group differences among conditions.",pq_id,33388310,proquest_dt,NA,"Brannon, Sean",2007,THES,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Rain In Vision And Graphics.,"Rain produces sharp intensity fluctuations in images and videos which severely degrade the performance of outdoor vision systems. Removing the visual effects of rain is therefore important in order to make outdoor vision robust to rain. In contrast, in graphics, rain effects are desirable as they are often used to convey scene emotions in movies and in other graphics applications, such as games, to enhance realism. Developing efficient algorithms for realistic rendering of rain effects is however challenging. This thesis, studies rain from the perspective of vision and graphics. We have two main goals - (1)to understand the visual appearance of rain and (2)to develop efficient algorithms both for handling its effects in vision and for its realistic rendering in graphics. We begin by modeling the visual appearance of rain. We describe the appearance by modeling the photometric intensities produced by individual raindrops and the space-time correlation produced by the motion of a large number of rain drops. We then use these appearance models to develop two complementary approaches to handle the effects of rain on vision systems. The first approach uses a post-processing algorithm for detection and removal of rain from videos that have already been captured. In the second approach we use our appearance model to show that the unique physical properties of rain--its small size, high velocity and spatial distribution--makes its visibility depend strongly on camera parameters. This dependence is used to reduce the visibility of rain during image acquisition by judiciously selecting camera parameters. Conversely, camera parameters can also be chosen to enhance the visibility of rain. This ability can be used to develop an inexpensive and portable camera-based rain gauge that provides instantaneous rain-rate measurements. In graphics, we have developed two models for realistic rendering of rain. In the first model we consider the complex appearance patterns produced by close by raindrops. We show that these patterns are produced due to the rapid shape distortions (i.e. oscillations) that a raindrop undergoes as it falls and develop a physics-based model to faithfully render these complex appearance patterns. This model is then used to develop an efficient algorithm for rendering rain in images and videos. In the second work, we focus on realistic rendering of material-dependent splashing of raindrops. Here we measure raindrop splashes for 22 different realworld materials. These measurements are then used to build a compact stochastic model that accurately captures the material and inclination dependent splashing behavior of raindrops. Additionally, it allows a user to render physically plausible splashes for novel materials that have not been measured. These two methods have advanced the state of the art algorithms for rendering rain. We believe that this thesis presents a new approach for modeling dynamic weather effects and has opened new avenues for research in vision and graphics.",pq_id,33473591,proquest_dt,NA,"Garg, Kshitiz",2008,THES,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,Real-Time Smooth Surface Construction On The Graphics Processing Unit,"Increased realism in interactive graphics and gaming requires complex smooth surfaces to be rendered at ever higher frame rates. In particular, representations used to model surfaces offline, such as spline and subdivision surfaces, have to be modified or reorganized to allow for efficient usage of the graphics processing unit and its SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) parallelism. This dissertation presents a novel algorithm for converting quad meshes on the GPU to smooth, water-tight surfaces at the highest speed documented so far. The conversion reproduces bi-cubic splines wherever possible and closely mimics the shape of the Catmull-Clark subdivision surface by c-patches where a vertex has a valence different from 4. The smooth surface is piecewise polynomial and has well-defined normals everywhere.",pq_id,304655498,proquest_dt,NA,"Ni, Tianyun",2008,THES,Ph.D.,reviewer2,Tamas
,The Interplay Between Networks And Robotics: Networked Robots And Robotic Routers,"In this work, we explore the interplay between robotics and networks. Robots can benefit from an embedded network and also the network can benefit from the mobility of the robots.   We investigate the design space where the application is oriented towards robotics or networking, considering how much information about the environment is provided and what the sensing capabilities are.   At one end, the robots can benefit from the resources of an environment-embedded network, in which robot sensing and communication is enhanced by the network. We consider the design and implementation of practical pursuit-evasion games with networked robots, where a communication network provides sensing-at-a-distance as well as a communication backbone that enables tighter coordination between pursuers. Using the theory of zero-sum games, we develop an algorithm that computes the minimal completion time strategy for multi-pursuit multi-evasion when all players make optimal decisions based on complete knowledge. We then describe the design of a real-world mobile robot-based pursuit evasion game. We validate our algorithms by experiments in a moderate-scale testbed in a challenging office environment.   We then show that the network can also benefit from Robotics by taking advance of micro and macro motion. Robots can mitigate multi-path fading. We design a system that allows robots to cooperate and improve the real-world network throughput via a distributed cooperation framework. A mobile wireless network can also be quickly and autonomously deployed in urban search and rescue efforts, forming a communication substrate. We study the problem of determining the minimum number of mobile robots and how to position them so all clients are connected. Our approach to the problem is based on virtual potential fields where we treat each client as a virtual charged particle. We validate our algorithm with physical robots in an indoor environment and demonstrate that we are able to get feasible solutions.",pq_id,847028622,proquest_dt,NA,"Vieira, Marcos Augusto Menezes",2010,THES,Ph.D.,reviewer2,Tamas
,The Large Scale Peer-To-Peer (P2p) Live Streaming In The Internet,"A large number of emerging applications such as IPTV, event broadcast, online games and distance learning require the support of live video streaming, yet, this is perhaps the greatest unfulfilled promise of the Internet. The root of the problem is that the Internet by nature, i.e., autonomous, heterogeneous, best-effort, can not provide the services required by streaming applications. The recent development in Peer-to-Peer (P2P) technologies brings new momentum in live video streaming due to the inherent self-scaling property and easy deployment. In spite of its popularity, there is no consensus on how a large-scale P2P live streaming system works. There are two fundamental problems in the design space: topology formulation that relates to how a peer locates the video content from one another and content delivery. Further, there has been little study on the design trade-offs and large-scale measurements. This thesis fills this gap.    We leverage our earlier system, Coolstreaming, which was arguably the earliest large-scale P2P video streaming experiment and was widely referenced in the community as the benchmark (Google entries top 400,000). We have designed and implemented comprehensive logging tools to collect and analyze large sets of traces from real-world broadcasts, from which we establish a theoretical framework that (1) concretely demonstrate the fundamental system design trade-offs and further identify the main performance bottlenecks and key factors behind them. Specifically, we show (1) random topology formulation can lead to convergence and stability; (2) video streaming performance is critically affected by system dynamics, in particular churns; (3) the system exhibits excellent scaling property yet the uploading capacity contributions from peers are highly skewed, in which a small percentage of peers conbtribute most; (4) the scale and streaming performance is largely determined by how well the system can handle the flash crowd in live streaming event.",pq_id,304812003,proquest_dt,NA,"Xie, Susu",2008,THES,Ph.D.,reviewer2,Tamas

,Cortisol Fluctuates With Increases And Decreases In Negative Affect.,"Prior studies have reported cortisol secretion to be primarily influenced by negative affect, but less is known about cortisol activity during states of activation involving increased positive affect and decreased negative affect. On separate days, 30 healthy young men experienced: an activating and humorous video; a speech stressor; and a resting control period. Cortisol was measured in saliva before and after each 30-min mood induction. Positive affect (activation) was increased similarly by both the video and the speech compared to rest (p < .0001). Negative affect increased during the speech and decreased during the video (p < .001). Cortisol increased only during the speech (p < .0001). Following the video, however, cortisol was decreased significantly (p < .0001). Rest day cortisol revealed no differences across periods (p > .1). These results suggest that the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis is a dynamic system influenced by changes in negative affect irrespective of the experience of generalized activation.",no_id,nagy2015_7,nagy2015,Psychoneuroendocrinology,"Buchanan, T.

,Effects Of Videogame Play In Boys: An Examination Of Adrenocortical Activity And Behavior. Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B.,"This study sought to extend the literature on the effects of videogame play in young children, as well as extend and support the developmental psychobiological literature on cortisol-stress response in young children, including its relation to age and temperament. Cortisol levels, aggression, attention, and compliance were measured before and after play with a non-violent videogame for the treatment group, and before and after a children''s television program for the control group. Participants were 75 typically developing 5 to 7 year-old boys with videogame play experience, and their families. Children participated in a 1-½ hour laboratory session that included pre and posttest measures of salivary cortisol, free-play, and attention. A posttest interview was also administered to measure levels of interpersonal aggression. Parents completed three surveys: The Child Behavior Questionnaire (Ahadi, Rothbart, & Ye, 1993); The Child Behavior Checklist (Achenbach, & Edelbrock, 1981); and a demographic questionnaire. Parents also completed a posttest phone interview to assess child non-compliance. Data reported here confirm that boys who played routine, non-violent videogames demonstrated a significant increase in observable levels of object aggression immediately after videogame play, as well as an increase in non-compliance to parental requests for several hours after videogame play. In support of previous research (e.g., Davis, Donzella, Krueger, & Gunnar, 1999), children who scored higher on the temperamental dimension of surgency/extraversion exhibited significantly higher levels of cortisol two hours-posttest than non-surgent children. Boys in the videogame condition had higher levels of cortisol than boys in the control condition two hours posttest, but this effect was independent of temperamental profile, and did not reflect a within subject increase in cortisol. Contrary to expectations, older, not younger, children demonstrated increased levels of aggression, younger boys did not differ from older boys on levels of cortisol, and attention was not compromised by videogame play. The behavioral effects of videogame play warrant precautionary measures for surgent and non-surgent children with regard to routine videogame exposure. Suggestions for future researchers include longer-term follow-up, expansion of age ranges, and greater numbers of cortisol collections.",no_id,anderson2010_104,anderson2010,"Fulgham, L. M. (2003).

Exclusion criteria of physical load creatine kinase, CK-MB and myoglobin were hematocrit, used. The video game began 60 minutes after puncture of a forearm vein with an indwelling. Blood samples were taken 30 and 60 min after venipuncture during the Playtime in Intervals of 20 min and 30, 60 and 120 minute intervals after the game.  When cortisol occurred after an initial rise to a continuous significant decrease in plasma (alpha = 1%). The HGH levels fell initially, got on during the game and stayed after the game for a long time at a high level. However, the variations were not significant. The three tested free Fettsäueren myristic (C14), palmitic acid (C16) and stearic acid (C18) demonstrated a similar curve for the entire duration of the experiment. In the first 20 minutes of the game, the FFS concentrations rose, while the stearic acid reacted quantitatively with the largest increase (52%). As the game progresses, the levels decreased from FFS. The AbfalI proved to be significant in the palmitic acid (alpha = 1%). Remained therefore the other parameters, apart from strong, but difficult to interpret variations in CK-MB, the entire Versucbsdauer relatively constant.",no_id,nagy2015_1,nagy2015,Zeitschrift Für Psychosomatische Medizin Und Psychoanalyse,"Abdulla, W., Ludes, H., Frey, R.",1985,NA,NA,reviewer2,Tamas
,"Janey, B. A. (1999). Masculine Ideology, Television Viewing, And Father Availability As Risk Factors In The Development Of Aggression In Preadolescent Males (Unpublished Doctoral Dissertation). Kansas State University.","The purpose of this study was to examine how masculine ideology, father availability, and exposure to media violence may predict aggressive behavior in fifth and sixth grade boys. Two hundred and one preadolescent boys age 10-13 from six rural school districts completed a questionnaire containing items measuring the variables of interest and were rated on physical and verbal aggression by classroom teachers. Correlational analysis determined general relationships between criterion and predictor variables. Multivariate regression analysis revealed a significant overall relationship between predictor and criterion variables. There were no relationships between any predictor variables and teacher ratings of verbal and physical aggression. Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that self-reported measures were the only criterion variables that demonstrated significance. High levels of masculine ideology endorsement were significantly correlated with higher scores on self-reported aggression, and lower scores on aggression control, indicating that masculine ideology plays a significant role in the early formation of behavioral norms more approving of aggression. Full model regression indicated that endorsement of traditional beliefs about the male role was a more significant predictor of self-reported aggression than exposure to media violence or time spent playing video games. Also, boys who spent more time with fathers, scored significantly lower on self-reported aggression and were less inclined to endorse traditional male attitudes. The present study indicates that endorsement of traditional beliefs about the male role is a more significant predictor of self-reported aggressive behavior than exposure to media violence and time spent playing video games. It also indicates that boys who spend more time with an adult male in the role of parent, report lower levels of aggression and lower levels of endorsement of traditional male attitudes.",no_id,anderson2010_119,anderson2010,"Janey, B.

,Trait Aggression And Style Of Video Game Play: The Effects Of Violent Video Game Play On Aggressive Thoughts. Dissertation Abstracts International: Section A.,"This study examined whether males (N = 66) who play a violent video game (24: The Game) are more likely to form aggressive thoughts than males who play a nonviolent game (Tetris), and furthermore, whether this tendency to form aggressive thoughts is moderated by trait aggression, such that those with high levels of this personality trait would reliably report more aggressive thoughts. Players’ style of video game play (very aggressive versus less aggressive) was considered as well. Results indicated that, as predicted, participants who played the violent video game produced more aggressive thoughts than those who played the nonviolent game; however, contrary to our hypothesis, trait aggression did not moderate this relationship; i.e., the effects on playing the violent video game on aggressive cognitions were not statistically larger (or smaller) for those participants who scored high on the trait aggression index than for those who scored low. Using data obtained by measuring participants’ playing style during while playing 24: The Game, the results reveal that individuals do, indeed, tend to play video games, at least violent video games, in relatively different ways; in fact, the number of inPREVIEW vi game violent acts committed by players varied substantially (from a low of 57 acts to a high of 255 acts). Subsequent analyses indicated that participants’ level of trait aggression did not influence the style of video game play used (more aggressive versus less aggressive). However, results also indicated that a more aggressive playing style did, in fact, predict aggressive thoughts. Drawing on the theories of neo-associationism and GAM, this study offers an innovative approach to gaming research by considering one’s in-game aggressive playing style as well as individual difference variables (i.e. trait aggressiveness) in investigating the aggressive outcomes of violent video game play",no_id,anderson2010_57,anderson2010,"Paradise, A.

,"Violent Video Games: Aggression, Arousal, And Desensitization In Young Adolescent Boys (Unpublished Doctoral Dissertation).","Video games pervade the lives of today''s children and adolescents. With video games becoming increasingly violent and realistic, it is important to assess their impact. Thus, the purpose of this study was to test the effect of playing violent video games on children''s aggression, arousal, and desensitization to violence. One hundred and twenty-four male sixth- through eighth-graders were randomly assigned to play either a violent video game, a nonviolent video game, or to a control condition where subjects played a simple puzzle. The independent measures consisted of game played, past video game experience, and baseline aggression. The dependent measures consisted of aggression, arousal, and desensitization. Baseline levels of projective aggression were measured with the Child Hostility Inventory (CHI) and post-treatment levels of projective aggression were measured with the Multiple Adjective Check List (MACL). Post-treatment behavioral aggression was measured by the intensity of noxious noise delivered to an opponent in a competitive game. Physiological arousal (heart rate) was monitored with a pulse meter at designated times throughout the experimental conditions. Desensitization did demonstrate that past play experience was related to post-treatment behavioral aggression even when initial levels of aggression were controlled, but was not related to arousal or desensitization. Also demonstrated was that baseline aggression was related to behavioral and projective aggression.
The results are discussed within the context of some of the prominent theories of the transmission of aggressive behavior via violent media, specifically social learning theory and drive theory. Social learning theory was found to be a valuable framework for understanding the effect of video games on children and adolescents. Implications for research on video games are discussed.",no_id,anderson2010_87,anderson2010,"Cohn, L. B. (1995).

,Young Offenders And The Media: Viewing Habits And Preferences.,"In 1993, the British Board of Film Classification commissioned the Policy Studies Institute to initiate the first independent research study in more than 20 years into the television and video viewing habits of juvenile offenders. A representative sample was chosen, based on three or more arrests in 1992 of offenders aged between 10 and 17. They were asked to say what they watch, where and how they watch it, and what attracts them to it. The study also aimed to know to what extent young people who have been involved in crime actively seek out and enjoy representations of crime or violence. The book provides information on which to base a more balanced discussion of the viewing of crime and violence by young offenders. Because of the lack of consensus over possible links between violence on the screen and aggressive behaviour in viewers, debate about young offenders and their media use is frequently conducted at the level of assertion and assumption. The study reports the findings of research that compares the viewing habits and preferences of young offenders and schoolchildren of the same age. It examines what young people read, what they watch on television, on video and at the cinema, and the extent of their video game playing.",no_id,anderson2010_114,anderson2010,"Hagell, A., & Newburn, T.
