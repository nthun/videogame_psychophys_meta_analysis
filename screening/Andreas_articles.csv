,"""Games Are Made For Fun"": Lessons On The Effects Of Concept Maps In The Classroom Use Of Computer Games","Does using a computer game improve students' motivation to learn classroom material? The current study examined students' motivation to learn history concepts while playing a commercial, off-the-shelf computer game, Civilization III. The study examined the effect of using conceptual scaffolds to accompany game play. Students from three ninth-grade classrooms were assigned to one of three groups: one group used an expert generated concept map, one group constructed their own concept maps, and a control group used no map. It was predicted that the use of concept maps would enhance the educational value of the game playing activity, in particular students' motivational levels; however, the opposite happened. Students who used a concept map showed lower motivation on the task relative to their baseline motivation for regular classroom instruction. In contrast, the levels of motivation in playing the game, for students in the control group, met or exceeded their levels of motivation during regular classroom instruction. These results suggest that using a conceptual scaffold can decrease students' motivation to learn classroom material through game play, perhaps because conceptual maps can (a) focus students' attention on the difficulty of learning the concepts and on the extrinsic rewards for playing the game and (b) make game play less autonomous, less creative, and less active. All of these can negate the primary property that provides playing its principal potential pedagogical power: fun. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

,"""If You Can't Be With The One You Love, Love The One You're With"": How Individual Habituation Of Agent Interactions Improves Global Utility","Simple distributed strategies that modify the behavior of selfish individuals in a manner that enhances cooperation or global efficiency have proved difficult to identify. We consider a network of selfish agents who each optimize their individual utilities by coordinating (or anticoordinating) with their neighbors, to maximize the payoffs from randomly weighted pairwise games. In general, agents will opt for the behavior that is the best compromise (for them) of the many conflicting constraints created by their neighbors, but the attractors of the system as a whole will not maximize total utility. We then consider agents that act as creatures of habit by increasing their preference to coordinate (anticoordinate) with whichever neighbors they are coordinated (anticoordinated) with at present. These preferences change slowly while the system is repeatedly perturbed, so that it settles to many different local attractors. We find that under these conditions, with each perturbation there is a progressively higher chance of the system settling to a configuration with high total utility. Eventually, only one attractor remains, and that attractor is very likely to maximize (or almost maximize) global utility. This counterintuitive result can be understood using theory from computational neuroscience; we show that this simple form of habituation is equivalent to Hebbian learning, and the improved optimization of global utility that is observed results from well-known generalization capabilities of associative memory acting at the network scale. This causes the system of selfish agents, each acting individually but habitually, to collectively identify configurations that maximize total utility. © 2011 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",doi,10.1162/artl_a_00030,Scopus,Artificial Life,"Davies A.P., Watson R.A., Mills R., Buckley C.L., Noble J.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,"""Just Dance"": The Effects Of Exergame Feedback And Controller Use On Physical Activity And Psychological Outcomes","Objective: In Asia, dance games are among the most popular types of exergames. Whereas traditional dance-based games emphasize step movements on a dance pad, more recent dance games emphasize intuitive dance movements using simple controllers or players' own bodies to ""just dance."" However, because of limited space and access, young adults in Taiwan often do not use these games. Popular dance videos on YouTube are more readily available to students because these videos can be accessed on a computer. Therefore, the current study examines the effects of interactivity (the role of feedback) and controller use on participants' physiological and psychological outcomes during exergames. Materials and Methods: The dance game ""Just Dance 3"" (Ubisoft, Montreuil, France) was chosen as the stimulus for this study. Participants danced through one song for rehearsal and warm-up, followed by three songs for the experiment, which lasted approximately 12 minutes. One hundred twenty-nine college students participated in a 2×2×2 (interactivity, feedback versus no feedback; controller, with versus without; sex, male versus female) between-subject factorial design. Results: A series of 2×2×2 (interactivity, controller, and sex) analyses of variance showed no significant differences in interaction effects on participants' heart rates, blood pressures, body movements, step counts, or perceived psychological outcomes. Conclusions: Dance game videos without feedback are also effective tools for achieving moderate-level exercise intensity. These videos can supplement the limited access to games in Asian countries, such as Taiwan. © Copyright 2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2015.",doi,10.1089/g4h.2014.0092,Scopus,Games for Health Journal,Lin J.-H.,2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,A Behavioral Test Of Accepting Benefits That Cost Others: Associations With Conduct Problems And Callous-Unemotionality,"Background: Youth with conduct problems (CP) often make decisions which value self-interest over the interests of others. Self-benefiting behavior despite loss to others is especially common among youth with CP and callous-unemotional traits (CU). Such behavioral tendencies are generally measured using self- or observer-report. We are unaware of attempts to measure this tendency with a behavioral paradigm. Methods/Principal Findings: In our AlAn's (altruism-antisocial) game a computer program presents subjects with a series of offers in which they will receive money but a planned actual charity donation will be reduced; subjects decide to accept or reject each offer. We tested (1) whether adolescent patients with CP (n = 20) compared with adolescent controls (n = 19) differed on AlAn's game outcomes, (2) whether youths with CP and CU differed significantly from controls without CP or CU, and (3) whether AlAn's game outcomes correlated significantly with CP and separately, CU severity. Patients with CP and CU compared with controls without these problems took significantly more money for themselves and left significantly less money in the charity donation; AlAn's game outcomes were significantly correlated with CU, but not CP. Conclusions/Significance: In the AlAn's game adolescents with conduct problems and CU traits, compared with controls without CP/CU, are disposed to benefit themselves while costing others even in a novel situation, devoid of peer influences, where anonymity is assured, reciprocity or retribution are impossible, intoxication is absent and when the ""other"" to be harmed is considered beneficent. AlAn's game outcomes are associated with measures of CU. Results suggest that the AlAn's game provides an objective means of capturing information about CU traits. The AlAn's game, which was designed for future use in the MRI environment, may be used in studies attempting to identify the neural correlates of self-benefiting decision-making. © 2012 Sakai et al.",doi,10.1371/journal.pone.0036158,Scopus,PLoS ONE,"Sakai J.T., Dalwani M.S., Gelhorn H.L., Mikulich-Gilbertson S.K., Crowley T.J.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,A Brief Survey On Secure Multi-Party Computing In The Presence Of Rational Parties,"Intelligent agents (IA) are autonomous entities which observe through sensors and act upon an environment using actuators to adjust their activities towards achieving certain goals. The architectures of agents have enormous potentials when they are applied into critical systems, where agents choose actions between working with their own and cooperating with others. Rational utility-based agents choose actions to maximize their expected utilities. Rational secure multi-party computing (RSMPC) means secure multi-party computing (SMPC) in the presence of rational utility-based agents. Here, we call them rational parties. In this paper certain goals of rational parties are maximizing their utilities. The introduction of rational parties considers the incentives in executing protocols. The security definitions under rational framework can better demonstrate the executing environment of real protocols. Furthermore, rational two-party computing removes some impossibility in traditional two-party computing, such as fairness. This paper represents the research status of RSMPC and some typical protocols. The advantages and disadvantages of previous rational SMPC protocols are discussed here. As an emerging field, there are still lots of open problems in RSMPC, such as communication channels, utility assumptions and equilibrium notions etc. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",doi,10.1007/s12652-015-0299-2,Scopus,Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing,"Wang Y., Li T., Qin H., Li J., Gao W., Liu Z., Xu Q.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,A Computer Based System To Design Expressive Avatars,"Avatars are used in different contexts and situations: e-commerce, e-therapy, virtual worlds, videogames, collaborative online design... In this context, a good design of an avatar may improve the user experience. The ability of controlling the way an avatar convey messages and emotions is capital. In this work, a procedure to design avatar faces capable of conveying to the observer the most suitable sensations according to a given context is developed. The proposed system is based on a combination of genetic algorithms and artificial neural networks whose training is based on perceptual human responses to a set of faces. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

,A Framework For Adaptive Game Presenters With Emotions And Social Comments,"More and more games today try to adjust their gameplay to fit individual players; however, little work has been carried out in the same direction towards game presenter characters. Game commentary should take into account players' personalities along with game progress in order to achieve social player-adapted comment delivery that boosts the overall gameplay, engages the players, and stimulates the audience. In our work, we discuss a framework for implementing artificial game presenter characters that are based on game actions and players' social profiles in order to deliver knowledgeable, socially oriented comments. Moreover, the presented framework supports emotional facial expressions for the presenters, allowing them to convey their emotions and thus be more expressive than the majority of the commentary systems today. We prove our concept by developing a presenter character for multiplayer tabletop board games which we further put under usability evaluation with 9 players. The results showed that game sessions with presenter characters are preferred over the plain version of the game and that the majority of the players enjoy personalized social-oriented comments expressed via multimedia and emotions. © 2012 Effie Karouzaki and Anthony Savidis.",doi,10.1155/2012/929814,Scopus,International Journal of Computer Games Technology,"Karouzaki E., Savidis A.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,A Game-Theoretic Framework For Landmark-Based Image Segmentation,"A novel game-theoretic framework for landmark- based image segmentation is presented. Landmark detection is formulated as a game, in which landmarks are players, landmark candidate points are strategies, and likelihoods that candidate points represent landmarks are payoffs, determined according to the similarity of image intensities and spatial relationships between the candidate points in the target image and their corresponding landmarks in images from the training set. The solution of the formulated game-theoretic problem is the equilibrium of candidate points that represent landmarks in the target image and is obtained by a novel iterative scheme that solves the segmentation problem in polynomial time. The object boundaries are finally extracted by applying dynamic programming to the optimal path searching problem between the obtained adjacent landmarks. The performance of the proposed framework was evaluated for segmentation of lung fields from chest radiographs and heart ventricles from cardiac magnetic resonance cross sections. The comparison to other landmark-based segmentation techniques shows that the results obtained by the proposed game-theoretic framework are highly accurate and precise in terms of mean boundary distance and area overlap. Moreover, the framework overcomes several shortcomings of the existing techniques, such as sensitivity to initialization and convergence to local optima. © 2012 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TMI.2012.2202915,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,"Ibragimov B., Likar B., Pernuš F., Vrtovec T.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,A Meta-Analysis Of Active Video Games On Health Outcomes Among Children And Adolescents,"This meta-analysis synthesizes current literature concerning the effects of active video games (AVGs) on children/adolescents' health-related outcomes. A total of 512 published studies on AVGs were located, and 35 articles were included based on the following criteria: (i) data-based research articles published in English between 1985 and 2015; (ii) studied some types of AVGs and related outcomes among children/adolescents and (iii) had at least one comparison within each study. Data were extracted to conduct comparisons for outcome measures in three separate categories: AVGs and sedentary behaviours, AVGs and laboratory-based exercise, and AVGs and field-based physical activity. Effect size for each entry was calculated with the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software in 2015. Mean effect size (Hedge's g) and standard deviation were calculated for each comparison. Compared with sedentary behaviours, AVGs had a large effect on health outcomes. The effect sizes for physiological outcomes were marginal when comparing AVGs with laboratory-based exercises. The comparison between AVGs and field-based physical activity had null to moderate effect sizes. AVGs could yield equivalent health benefits to children/adolescents as laboratory-based exercise or field-based physical activity. Therefore, AVGs can be a good alternative for sedentary behaviour and addition to traditional physical activity and sports in children/adolescents. © 2015 World Obesity.",doi,10.1111/obr.12287,Scopus,Obesity Reviews,"Gao Z., Chen S., Pasco D., Pope Z.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,A Multi-Component Social Skills Intervention For Children With Asperger Syndrome: The Junior Detective Training Program,"Background: The study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a new multi-component social skills intervention for children with Asperger syndrome (AS): The Junior Detective Training Program. This 7-week program included a computer game, small group sessions, parent training sessions and teacher handouts. Method: Forty-nine children with AS were recruited to participate and randomly assigned to intervention (n = 26) or wait-list control (n = 23) conditions. Results: Relative to children in the wait-list group, program participants showed greater improvements in social skills over the course of the intervention, as indicated by parent-report measures. Teacher-report data also confirmed that children receiving the intervention made significant improvements in social functioning from pre- to post-treatment. Treatment group participants were better able to suggest appropriate emotion-management strategies for story characters at post-intervention than at pre-intervention, whereas control participants were not. However, there was no difference in the improvements made by children in the intervention and control conditions on facial expression and body-posture recognition measures. Follow-up data suggested that treatment gains were maintained by children at 5-months post-intervention. Conclusions: The Junior Detective Training Program appeared to be effective in enhancing the social skills and emotional understanding of children with AS. Limitations and suggestions for future research are discussed. © 2008 The Authors.",doi,10.1111/j.1469-7610.2008.01920.x,Scopus,Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry and Allied Disciplines,"Beaumont R., Sofronoff K.",2008,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,A Personal Approach: An Empirical Study Of The Process Of Studying My Son’s Problem With Computer Games,"This study explored the process of taking a personal approach to my son’s problems with computer games. As a psychology student, I should have been in a good position to explore the paradoxical emotions and this situation of conflict. Yet I was also aware that relating closely to the people we are studying has long been a taboo even in qualitative research. I nevertheless adopted a collaborative methodology in which I balanced a dual role of parent and researcher. Taking a personal approach, allowing intimate, reciprocal negotiation, I was not only able to put this taboo to the rare empirical test but also achieved an insight that would otherwise have not been available to me. By engaging in dialogue and encouraging the ability to object, a first-person plural (We), position was achieved in which an understanding of this situation developed and has transferred to our everyday lives. © The Author(s) 2015.",doi,10.1177/1609406915618048,Scopus,International Journal of Qualitative Methods,"Weir K., Costall A.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,"A Pilot Study Evaluating ""Dojo,"" A Videogame Intervention For Youths With Externalizing And Anxiety Problems","Objective: Externalizing problems, which are the main reason for youth referrals to mental health agencies, are highly persistent and predict a range of negative outcomes. Youths with externalizing problems are also frequently comorbid with anxiety. Among the most widely recognized evidence-based treatments is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Although CBT principles seem to be sound, effect sizes remain moderate, suggesting improvements could be made to this conventional treatment approach. The main premise of the current pilot study is to investigate the feasibility of implementing a videogame intervention (""Dojo"" [Gamedesk, Los Angeles, CA]) that incorporates CBT principles and aims to address the limitations of conventional CBT delivery models, with the ultimate goal of improving outcomes for this difficult-to-treat population. Materials and Methods: ""Dojo"" is an emotion management game that helps youths to recognize and control their physiological and emotional arousal. We explored the implementation and user experience of ""Dojo"" in a sample of eight adolescents in residential treatment for both externalizing and anxiety problems. Results: Participants attended all sessions without complaints. They evaluated ""Dojo"" very positively and exhibited high compliance during the training sessions. We encountered some problems with session scheduling and obtaining mentor reports. Quantitative data show the predicted decrease in three out of four measurements. Conclusions: The smooth implementation, high user satisfaction, high self-reported compliance during training sessions, and initial outcome results all indicate the high potential ""Dojo"" holds as an innovative intervention. If additional rigorously designed randomized controlled trials prove to be successful, ""Dojo"" can be a cost-effective way to engage high-risk youths in effective intervention. © Copyright 2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2015.",doi,10.1089/g4h.2014.0138,Scopus,Games for Health Journal,"Schuurmans A.A.T., Nijhof K.S., Vermaes I.P.R., Engels R.C.M.E., Granic I.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,A Pricing Mechanism For Resource Allocation In Wireless Multimedia Applications,"We consider the problem of multiuser resource allocation for wireless multimedia applications deployed by autonomous and noncollaborative wireless stations (WSTAs). Existing resource allocation solutions for WLANs are not network-aware and do not take into account the selfish behavior of individual WSTAs. Specifically, the selfish WSTAs can manipulate the network by untruthfully representing their private information (i.e., video characteristics, experienced channel conditions, and deployed streaming strategies). This often results in inefficient resource allocations. To overcome this obstacle, we present a pricing mechanism for message exchanges between the WSTAs and the Central Spectrum Moderator (CSM). The messages represent network-aware resource demands and corresponding prices. We prove that the message exchanges reach the Nash equilibrium and that the resulting equilibrium messages generate allocations which are efficient, budget balanced, and satisfy voluntary participation. The simulation results verify that these properties hold when the WSTAs behave strategically. Additionally, we evaluate the impact of initial prices and network congestion level on the convergence rate of message exchanges. © 2007 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/JSTSP.2007.901519,Scopus,IEEE Journal on Selected Topics in Signal Processing,"Fu F., Stoenescu T.M., van der Schaar M.",2007,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,A Randomized Controlled Trial Of Dance Exergaming For Exercise Training In Overweight And Obese Adolescent Girls,"Background: Structured exergaming with prescribed moderate intensity physical activity has reduced adiposity among adolescents. The extent to which adolescents reduce adiposity when allowed to self-select intensity level is not known. Objective: The objective of the study was to examine the influence of exergaming on adolescent girls' body composition and cardiovascular risk factors. Methods: This randomized controlled trial assigned 41 overweight and obese girls aged 14 to 18 years to group-based dance exergaming (36 h over 3 months) or to a self-directed care control condition. Body size and composition were measured by anthropometry, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry [%fat and bone mineral density {BMD}] and magnetic resonance imaging. Cardiovascular risk factors included blood pressure, cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose and insulin. Results: Attrition was 5%. Using analysis of covariance controlling for baseline value, age and race, there were no significant condition differences. Per protocol (attended >75%), the intervention group significantly decreased abdominal subcutaneous adiposity and increased trunk and spine BMD (ps < 0.05). Per protocol (>2600 steps/session), the intervention group significantly decreased leg %fat and decreased abdominal subcutaneous and total adiposity (ps < 0.05). Conclusion: Exergaming reduced body fat and increased BMD among those adolescent girls who adhered. Further research is required before exergaming is recommended in clinical settings. © 2016 World Obesity Federation",doi,10.1111/ijpo.12117,Scopus,Pediatric Obesity,"Staiano A.E., Marker A.M., Beyl R.A., Hsia D.S., Katzmarzyk P.T., Newton R.L.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas

,A Twin Study Of Cardiac Reactivity And Its Relationship To Parental Blood Pressure,"The cardiac reactivity of 40 monozygotic and 40 dizygotic pairs of young male twins was monitored during psychological challenge, as afforded by a video game. The observed pattern of variation could not be accounted for solely by environmental factors. In fact, a simple genetic model that implicated additive genetic effects, along with those stemming from individual environments, best fitted the data. In addition, cardiac reactions were substantially greater for subjects whose parents both had relatively elevated blood pressure. Overall, these data suggest individual differences in cardiac reactivity have a heritable component, and that high reactivity may be a precursor of elevated blood pressure. © 1985.",doi,10.1016/0031-9384(85)90085-X,Scopus,Physiology and Behavior,"Carroll D., Hewitt J.K., Last K.A., Turner J.R., Sims J.",1985,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Acceptability Of Video Games Technology For Medical Emergency Training,"Using the technology acceptance model (TAM), this study aimed to investigate the acceptability of video game technologies (serious games) for medical emergency procedure and decision making training. Using the Triage Trainer, a prototype serious game for the triage sieve process, differences between gamers and non-gamers, males and females, and the effects of ratings of computer self efficacy (i.e. computer skill and gaming skill) and attitudes towards computers (i.e. enthusiasm and anxiety) on the acceptance model were also investigated. The results show significant correlations for computer self-efficacy and attitude variables with the perceived ease of use (PEOU), perceived usefulness (PU) and attitudes towards use (ATU) of the game. Multiple regression showed that 52% of the variance in ATU was explained by the PU and PEOU. However, none of the secondary variables (self efficacy or emotions) had a significant effect on the ATU, PU and PEOU over and above each other.

,Active Video Games To Promote Physical Activity In Children And Youth: A Systematic Review.,"To systematically review levels of metabolic expenditure and changes in activity patterns associated with active video game (AVG) play in children and to provide directions for future research efforts. A review of the English-language literature (January 1, 1998, to January 1, 2010) via ISI Web of Knowledge, PubMed, and Scholars Portal using the following keywords: video game, exergame, physical activity, fitness, exercise, energy metabolism, energy expenditure, heart rate, disability, injury, musculoskeletal, enjoyment, adherence, and motivation. Only studies involving youth (< or = 21 years) and reporting measures of energy expenditure, activity patterns, physiological risks and benefits, and enjoyment and motivation associated with mainstream AVGs were included. Eighteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Articles were reviewed and data were extracted and synthesized by 2 independent reviewers. MAIN OUTCOME EXPOSURES: Energy expenditure during AVG play compared with rest (12 studies) and activity associated with AVG exposure (6 studies). Percentage increase in energy expenditure and heart rate (from rest). Activity levels during AVG play were highly variable, with mean (SD) percentage increases of 222% (100%) in energy expenditure and 64% (20%) in heart rate. Energy expenditure was significantly lower for games played primarily through upper body movements compared with those that engaged the lower body (difference, -148%; 95% confidence interval, -231% to -66%; P = .001). The AVGs enable light to moderate physical activity. Limited evidence is available to draw conclusions on the long-term efficacy of AVGs for physical activity promotion.",doi,10.1001/archpediatrics.2010.104,pubmed,Archives of pediatrics &amp; adolescent medicine,"Biddiss, Elaine; Irwin, Jennifer",2010,NA,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Activity Profile And Physiological Demands Of Top-Class Soccer Assistant Refereeing In Relation To Training Status,"To determine the movement patterns and physiological demands of top-class soccer assistant referees, we performed computerized time-motion analysis and measured heart rate and blood lactate concentration in 15 assistant referees during 22 competitive matches in the top Danish league. To relate match performance to the physical capability of the assistant referees, they performed a 3 × 30 m sprint protocol before and after matches and a laboratory treadmill test within 3 weeks of the games. The mean total distance covered by the top-class assistant referees was 7.28 (range 5.78-8.16) km, of which 1.15 (0.86-1.44) km was high-intensity running and 1.16 (0.12-2.34) km was sideways running. The amount of high-intensity running during a game was correlated with performance of repeated sprints (r = 0.80, P &lt; 0.05). Mean heart rate was 137 (117-159) beats.min-1, corresponding to 73% (60-88%) of maximal heart rate and 65% (53-80%) of maximal oxygen uptake. Blood lactate concentration was 4.7 (1.6-11.0) and 4.8 (1.1-13.7) mmol.l-1 after the first and second half, respectively. Sprinting performance was poorer (P &lt; 0.05) after than before the games. The peak distance to the offside line was greater (P &lt; 0.05) in the second than the first half (7 ± 1 vs 5 ± 0 m). Our results show that: (1) top-class assistant soccer refereeing is characterized by brief intense bouts of forward and sideways running interspersed with long periods of low activity; (2) top-class soccer assistant referees have moderate aerobic energy production during games with episodes of high aerobic and anaerobic energy turnover; (3) assistant referees' performance of repeated sprints correlates with the amount of high-intensity running performed in a game; and (4) sprint performance decreases towards the end of a game, which appears to affect assistant referees' ability to keep up with play.",doi,10.1080/026404102320761778,Scopus,Journal of Sports Sciences,"Krustrup P., Mohr M., Bangsbo J.",2002,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Adaptation In Affective Video Games: A Literature Review,"Playing computer games is a predominantly emotional than rational process. Video games with affect-based adaptation measure player's behavior signals and recognize player's emotional states in order to adapt specific game features in a dynamic manner and to improve player's engagement, immersion, excitement, and challenge. The present review deals with models for the presentation of emotions, techniques for measuring behavioral signals, emotion recognition and adaptation mechanisms applied in video games with affective feedback including methods for their assessment and validation. Studies using self-reports, observational methods and psychophysiological measurements of both autonomic and central nervous systems including processing and interpretation of signals are systematically reviewed with regard to their results concerning emotional adaptation in games. Next, the article provides a comparative analysis of affect-based adaptation methods and techniques applied in 14 adaptive video games developed in last ten years.

,Affective Level Design For A Role-Playing Videogame Evaluated By A Brain–Computer Interface And Machine Learning Methods,"Game science has become a research field, which attracts industry attention due to a worldwide rich sell-market. To understand the player experience, concepts like flow or boredom mental states require formalization and empirical investigation, taking advantage of the objective data that psychophysiological methods like electroencephalography (EEG) can provide. This work studies the affective ludology and shows two different game levels for Neverwinter Nights 2 developed with the aim to manipulate emotions; two sets of affective design guidelines are presented, with a rigorous formalization that considers the characteristics of role-playing genre and its specific gameplay. An empirical investigation with a brain–computer interface headset has been conducted: by extracting numerical data features, machine learning techniques classify the different activities of the gaming sessions (task and events) to verify if their design differentiation coincides with the affective one. The observed results, also supported by subjective questionnaires data, confirm the goodness of the proposed guidelines, suggesting that this evaluation methodology could be extended to other evaluation tasks. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",doi,10.1007/s00371-016-1320-2,Scopus,Visual Computer,"Balducci F., Grana C., Cucchiara R.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Aggressive Political Opinions And Exposure To Violent Media.,"This study examines the relationship between young people's exposure to media violence and their aggressive political opinions (APO), which were defined as support for positions that involve forceful resolution to social or political issues. Students from 2 U.S. universities completed surveys assessing their APO, exposure to violent media, authoritarianism, trait aggressiveness, political leaning, personal experience with crime, and demographics. Results revealed that violent television exposure significantly predicted several forms of APO above and beyond the control variables. Playing violent video games, however, predicted only a few aggressive political opinions. The results of this study support the reliability and validity of the APO measure, shed light on the relationship between exposure to violent media content and political opinions, and suggest some important differences between television and video game content in the effects process.",doi,10.1207/s15327825mcs0904_2,anderson2010,Mass Communication and Society,"Eyal, K., Metzger, M.

,Alternative Options For Prescribing Physical Activity Among Obese Children And Adolescents: Brisk Walking Supported By An Exergaming Platform [Opciones Alternativas Para Prescribir Actividad Física Entre Niños Y Adolescentes Obesos: Marcha Rápida Con El Apoyo De Videojuegos Activos],"Background: Physical inactivity has been identified as an important public health concern for children. An increasing sedentary way of life is directly related to obesity; hence, prevention and management of childhood obesity are commonly based on lifestyle interventions wherein increasing physical activity is one of the main targets. The use of exergames can be useful in promoting physical activity, but it is necessary more research. This study analyzes the effects of an exergaming platform that involves brisk walking, on perceived exertion, self-efficacy, positive expectations and satisfaction in a sample of clinically obese children, as compared with normal weight children. Physiological variables like heart rate, oxygen consumption and energy expenditure were also measured. Method: A total sample of 42 children was recruited. Children were randomized into those walking on a treadmill and those using a treadmill with the support of the exergaming platform (Wii-Fit). Results: The obese children scored significantly higher in expectations and satisfaction in the exergame condition but not in self-efficacy, perceived exertion or physiological measures. Conclusions: These results suggest that this exergaming platform could be a tool to assist obese children in the practice of brisk walking as part of a programme designed to treat obesity. © 2015, Grupo Aula Medica S.A.

,An Analysis Of Physiological Signals As A Measure Of Task Engagement In A Multi-Limb-Coordination Motor-Learning Task.,"There is widespread agreement in the physical rehabilitation community that task engagement is essential to effective neuromuscular recovery. Despite this, there are no clear measures of such task engagement. This paper assesses the extent to which certain physiological measurements might provide a measure of task engagement. In previous studies, correlations between mental focus and certain physiological measurements have been observed in subjects performing tasks requiring mental effort. In this study, the authors analyzed whether these signals showed similar correlation when subjects performed a multi-limb-coordination motor-learning task. Subjects played a video game which required the use of both arms and one leg to play a simplified electronic drum set with varying difficulty. Heart rate (HR), skin conductance level (SCL), and facial electromyogram (EMG) were recorded while the subjects played. Analysis of the recordings showed statistically significant correlations relating task difficulty to SCL, HR and EMG amplitude in corrugator supercilii. No statistically significant correlation was observed between task difficulty and EMG in frontalis.",doi,10.1109/EMBC.2015.7318803,pubmed,Conference proceedings : ...

,An Empirical Study About The Use Of The Internet And Computer Games Among Croatian Children,"This book chapter is dedicated to theoretical and empirical review of media among children. Empirical results about computer presence in family homes, IT literacy with different computer programmes among parents, as well children are described. In addition, attitudes of parents and preschool and school-aged children about using Internet and computer games as well as attitudes toward the Internet violence are analysed. The results of games types that children play as well as frequency of playing and children's emotions evoked by them are shown. Finally, the results about presence of significant others as well as their conversation with children are shown. All of the above are interestingly studied in the frame of correlation analysis to research relations between some socio-demographic variables (sex, age, the level of education, and presence of computer in family home), so certain future research guidelines can be established. © 2015, IGI Global.

,An Evaluation Of The Physiological Demands Of Elite Rugby Union Using Global Positioning System Tracking Software,"Cunniffe, B, Practor, W, Baker, JS, and Davies, B. An evaluation of the physiological demands of elite rugby union using GPS tracking software. J Strength Cond Res 23(4): 1195-1203, 2009-The current case study attempted to document the contemporary demands of elite rugby union. Players (n = 2) were tracked continuously during a competitive team selection game using Global Positioning System (GPS) software. Data revealed that players covered on average 6,953 m during play (83 minutes). Of this distance, 37% (2,800 m) was spent standing and walking, 27% (1,900 m) jogging, 10% (700 m) cruising, 14% (990 m) striding, 5% (320 m) high-intensity running, and 6% (420 m) sprinting. Greater running distances were observed for both players (6.7% back; 10% forward) in the second half of the game. Positional data revealed that the back performed a greater number of sprints (&gt;20 km.h-1) than the forward (34 vs. 19) during the game. Conversely, the forward entered the lower speed zone (6-12 km.h-1) on a greater number of occasions than the back (315 vs. 229) but spent less time standing and walking (66.5 vs. 77.8%). Players were found to perform 87 moderate-intensity runs (&gt;14 km.h-1) covering an average distance of 19.7 m (SD = 14.6). Average distances of 15.3 m (back) and 17.3 m (forward) were recorded for each sprint burst (&gt;20 km.h-1), respectively. Players exercised at -80 to 85% Vo2max during the course of the game with a mean heart rate of 172 b.min-1 (∼88% HRmax). This corresponded to an estimated energy expenditure of 6.9 and 8.2 MJ, back and forward, respectively. The current study provides insight into the intense and physical nature of elite rugby using ""on the field"" assessment of physical exertion. Future use of this technology may help practitioners in design and implementation of individual position-specific training programs with appropriate management of player exercise load. © 2009 National Strength and Conditioning Association.",doi,10.1519/JSC.0b013e3181a3928b,Scopus,Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research,"Cunniffe B., Proctor W., Baker J.S., Davies B.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,An Exploratory Study Examining The Appropriateness And Potential Benefit Of The Nintendo Wii As A Physical Activity Tool In Adults Aged ≥ 55 Years,"This study investigates the physical exertion of playing the Nintendo Wii® (Wii) and determines the appropriateness and potential benefit of it as a physical activity tool for older adults. Twenty healthy adults (aged 61±6 years) took part in a single session using a selection of the Wii Sports and Wii Fit games. During the gameplay session, heart rate and perceived exertion were measured. Pre-and post-session, we investigated mood using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) and cognitive function (i.e. aptitude, abstract reasoning and problem solving) using the test of non-verbal intelligence (TONI-IQ) and trail B tests. We also gathered subjective feedback from participants using semi-structured interviews and questionnaires. Three of the game activities (hula-hoop, rowing squat and leg extension) were identified to reach a moderate level of heart rate intensity, with one activity (jogging) corresponding to a vigorous level. We identified that post-session PANAS-positive subscale scores were greater than pre-session scores (P&lt;0.01). There was a reduction in the time to complete the TONI-IQ test from pre-to post-session (P&lt;0.05). Findings from these data identify that some Wii activities were of an intensity required for health benefits; a single Wii activity session can result in positive mood changes and the Wii interface is generally acceptable and appropriate for this older age adult group. Further randomized controlled and longer term intervention trials are needed to determine the effectiveness of exergame activity programmes. © 2013 The Author.",doi,10.1093/iwc/iws004,Scopus,Interacting with Computers,"Kirk A., MacMillan F., Rice M., Carmichael A.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,An Institutional Case Study: Emotion Regulation With Heartmath At Santa Cruz County Children's Mental Health.,"This case study from Santa Cruz County Children's Mental Health Agency (CMH), California, reviews the use of measurement of heart rate variability (HRV) to enhance emotional regulation of patients. CMH serves seriously emotionally disturbed youths, many of whom have been separated from their parents for a prolonged period or have been vulnerable without the consistent presence of their caregivers. In this study, the HRV pattern was calculated as high coherence, medium coherence, or low coherence. According to Thurber et al, heart rhythm coherence ""is experienced as a calm, balanced, yet energized and responsive state that is conducive to everyday functioning and interaction, including the performance of tasks requiring mental acuity, focus, problem solving and decision making, as well as physical activity and coordination.""(1(p39)) In the HeartMath program, there was a game in which high coherence was rewarded with a rainbow that dropped coins into a vessel. When coherence was low, the rainbow and coins disappeared until coherence was reached again. We measured HRV using a finger or ear sensor in individual sessions using a computer-based program from HeartMath Institute, Boulder Creek, California. After juvenile offenders overcame their initial fear of being hooked up to a potential lie detector, I instructed them in ""Quick Coherence""(1) and asked them to imagine breathing into the area of their heart. The participants created a library of positive feelings, thoughts, and memories on which they could focus. After a period of positive focus and rhythmic breathing, the clients were often able to move into medium or high coherence. In this state, they noticed that they felt calmer. I explained that they could use this tool to improve their mood. I also practiced alongside the youths in order to demonstrate the technique. The detained youths learned quickly, requested repeated sessions, and learned to combine breathing with recalling the good people, places, foods, and feelings in their lives that sustained them. We could also decrease coherence through the use of negative words such as ""loss of privileges"" on their side or ""pay cut"" on mine and then move back to coherence with suggestions of positive mental images.",doi,10.7453/gahmj.2014.007,pubmed,Global advances in health and medicine,"Lutz, Barbara",2014,NA,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,An Overview Of Virtual Humans,"Virtual Humans simulations are becoming more and more popular. Nowadays many systems are available to animate Virtual Humans. Such systems encompass several different domains: autonomous agents in Virtual Environments, human factors analysis, training, education, virtual prototyping, simulation-based design, and entertainment. Virtual Humans are commonly used nowadays in the entertainment industry, and most specifically in movies and video games. If the quality of pictures has been dramatically improved during the last years, the animation is still a major bottleneck in production. In this chapter, we first emphasize the role of Virtual Humans, then we present a history and the numerous applications of Virtual Humans. We conclude with a presentation of the main challenges of Virtual Humans that are discussed in this book. © 2004 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

,Anaerobic Work Capacity In Elite Wheelchair Athletes,"To study the anaerobic work capacity in wheelchair athletes, 67 elite wheelchair athletes (50 male) were studied in a 30-second sprint test on a computer-controlled wheelchair ergometer during the World Championships and Games for the Disabled in Assen (1990). The experimental set-up (ergometer, protocol) proved to be adequate in terms of power output (P30, P5) velocity and heart rate. Male and female athletes were comparable with respect to personal characteristics (age, body weight, training hours). Track athletes (classified in 4 different functional classes) showed a class-related mean power output (P30: mean power produced during the 30-second sprint period) of 23, 68, 100, and 138 W for the male athletes (n = 38) and 38, 77, and 76 W for females in the upper three classes (n = 10). Sprint power was low for the group of subjects with cerebral palsy (35 W; mixed, n = 6) and relatively high for the amputee group (121 W; mixed, n = 6), female basketball players (81 W; n = 5), and two male field athletes (110 W). Significant differences between male and female athletes were found for P30 and P5 (highest mean power output over any of the six 5-second periods). As was to be expected, mean maximum heart rate in the sprint test varied significantly between the track groups from 112 (high lesion group) to 171 beats/minute-1 (low lesion group) but not for both genders. The lower P30 in the T1 and T2 groups must be explained not only by the reduced functional muscle mass and impaired coordination but also by phenomena of cardiovascular dysfunction. Based on the performance parameters, the functional classification of the track athletes into four groups seems adequate. P30 was significantly associated with the personal characteristics of gender and hours of training. A significant correlation was found between P30 and sprint performance times for 200 meters (r = -0.79). No correlation was found between either of the forms of power output and the marathon times. Anaerobic wheelchair work capacity can be adequately studied with the 30-second sprint test that was used in this study. Anaerobic work capacity is highly variable among elite wheelchair athletes with different disabilities and from different sports disciplines and appeared quite strongly influenced by functionality, hours of training, and gender.To study the anaerobic work capacity in wheelchair athletes, 67 elite wheelchair athletes were studied in a 30-second sprint test on a computer-controlled wheelchair ergometer. Male and female athletes were comparable with respect to personal characteristics. Track athletes showed a class-related mean power output of 23, 68, 100, and 138 W for male athletes and 38, 77, and 76 W for female in the upper three classes.

,Analysis Of Biosignals During Immersion In Computer Games.,"The number of computer game users is increasing as computers and various IT devices in connection with the Internet are commonplace in all ages. In this research, in order to find the relevance of behavioral activity and its associated biosignal, biosignal changes before and after as well as during computer games were measured and analyzed for 31 subjects. For this purpose, a device to measure electrocardiogram, photoplethysmogram and skin temperature was developed such that the effect of motion artifacts could be minimized. The device was made wearable for convenient measurement. The game selected for the experiments was League of Legends™. Analysis on the pulse transit time, heart rate variability and skin temperature showed increased sympathetic nerve activities during computer game, while the parasympathetic nerves became less active. Interestingly, the sympathetic predominance group showed less change in the heart rate variability as compared to the normal group. The results can be valuable for studying internet gaming disorder.",doi,10.1007/s10916-017-0860-y,pubmed,Journal of medical systems,"Yeo, Mina; Lim, Seokbeen; Yoon, Gilwon",2017,NA,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Anger Suppression And Adiposity Modulate Association Between Adrb2 Haplotype And Cardiovascular Stress Reactivity,"Objectives: The purpose of this study was to examine how variation in the beta-2 adrenergic receptor gene (ADRB2), in combination with the moderating influences of race, body mass index (BMI), and anger expression style (anger-in, anger-out), affects blood pressure (BP) at rest and in response to acute laboratory stress. Methods: Four hundred fifty adolescents (mean age = 18.5 ± 2.7 years; 228 [124 males] whites and 222 [110 males] blacks completed two stressors (video game challenge, forehead cold pressor). Hemodynamic measures were taken before, during, and after each stressor. Stressors were separated by a 20-minute rest period. Results: Frequency of detrimental haplotype (Gly16/Glu27) carrier status was greater among whites than blacks (p < .05). A significant three-way interaction among haplotype, BMI, and race for resting systolic blood pressure (SBP) found the highest BP level to be among high BMI carriers, but only for whites. A separate three-way interaction was found to be significant for haplotype, anger-in and race such that high anger-in carriers showed the highest level of resting SBP (p < .05) and total peripheral resistance (TPR) (p < .05) and the greatest TPR reactivity to the cold pressor task (p < .01). Post hoc analyses revealed these interactions with anger-in were only present among blacks. No significant interactions with anger-out for either ethnic group were observed. Conclusions: This study demonstrates modulating influences of BMI and anger expression styles on ADRB2 gene associations with hemodynamic function at rest and in response to laboratory stress. These findings support the hypothesis that consideration of gene-environment interactions may better characterize the role of ADRB2 variation in the development of stress-induced essential hypertension.

,Anxiety And Presence During Vr Immersion: A Comparative Study Of The Reactions Of Phobic And Non-Phobic Participants In Therapeutic Virtual Environments Derived From Computer Games,"Virtual reality can be used to provide phobic clients with therapeutic exposure to phobogenic stimuli. However, purpose-built therapeutic VR hardware and software can be expensive and difficult to adapt to individual client needs. In this study, inexpensive and readily adaptable PC computer games were used to provide exposure therapy to 13 phobic participants and 13 non-phobic control participants. It was found that anxiety could be induced in phobic participants by exposing them to phobogenic stimuli in therapeutic virtual environments derived from computer games (TVEDG). Assessments were made of the impact of simulator sickness and of sense of presence on the phobogenic effectiveness of TVEDGs. Participants reported low levels of simulator sickness, and the results indicate that simulator sickness had no significant impact on either anxiety or sense of presence. Group differences, correlations, and regression analyses indicate a synergistic relationship between presence and anxiety. These results do not support Slater's contention that presence and emotion are orthogonal.",doi,10.1089/109493103769710497,Scopus,Cyberpsychology and Behavior,"Robillard G., Bouchard S., Fournier T., Renaud P.",2003,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Art Video Games: Ritual Communication Of Feelings In The Digital Era,"This study conducted analytical and semiexperimental research with the purpose of testing if art video games serve as a form of transmission of social representations and feelings. Accordingly, a free-association questionnaire was used after participants played the game The Graveyard. The associative method was paired with item hierarchization and clustering techniques using a structural approach. The data were analyzed using mixed methods (frequency analysis, semantic weight, and categorical clustering). Additionally, a cluster analysis was conducted to determine connections between representations. Afterward, categories were compared with the representations the game designers wanted to transmit to the players. The results of the research confirmed the possibility of accessing people's social representations using a video game as stimulus. Cluster analyses depicted that these representations were emotionally linked and socially shared among the players without regard to age or gender. The relation with the designers' representations about the game was found to be not significant. © SAGE Publications 2014.",doi,10.1177/1555412014557543,Scopus,Games and Culture,"Díaz C.M.C., Tungtjitcharoen W.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Artificial Time Constraints On The Iowa Gambling Task: The Effects On Behavioural Performance And Subjective Experience,"In the last decade, the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) has become a widely employed neuropsychological research instrument for the investigation of executive function. The task has been employed in a wide range of formats, from 'manual' procedures to more recently introduced computerised versions. Computer-based formats often require that responses on the task should be artificially delayed by a number of seconds between trials to collect skin-conductance data. Participants, however, may become frustrated when they want to select from a particular deck in the time-limited versions-so that an unintended emotional experience of frustration might well disrupt a task presumed to be reliant on emotion-based learning. We investigated the effect of the various types of Iowa Gambling Task format on performance, using three types of task: the classic manual administration, with no time limitations; a computerised administration with a 6-s enforced delay; and a control computerised version which had no time constraints. We also evaluated the subjective experience of participants on each task. There were no significant differences in performance, between formats, in behavioural terms. Subjective experience measures on the task also showed consistent effects across all three formats-with substantial, and rapidly developing, awareness of which decks were 'good' and 'bad.' © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

,Ascending Aortic Tear With Severe Aortic Regurgitation Following Rugby Injury,Blunt ascending aortic injuries are rare in clinical practice. Aortic valve regurgitation is an uncommon consequence of closed chest injury. It is caused by either ruptured valve cusp or when subadventitial rupture of the ascending aorta causes prolapse of subjacent valve cusp. Most of the blunt aortic injuries are secondary to high speed motor vehicle accident or falls from significant height. We report on a 33-year-old man who sustained an injury during a rugby game and presented with severe aortic regurgitation secondary to subadventitial rupture of ascending aorta on a background of asymptomatic dilated aortic root. He underwent emergency operation for torrential aortic regurgitation and severe left ventricular failure. © 2007 Australasian Society of Cardiac and Thoracic Surgeons and the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand.,doi,10.1016/j.hlc.2007.10.015,Scopus,Heart Lung and Circulation,"Singhal P., Kejriwal N.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Assessing Users’ Emotion At Interaction Time: A Multimodal Approach With Multiple Sensors,"Users’ emotional states influence decision making and are essential for the knowledge and explanation of users’ behavior with computer applications. However, collecting emotional states during the interaction time with users is a onerous task because it requires very careful handling of the empirical observation, leading researchers to carry out assessments of emotional responses only at the end of the interaction. This paper reports our research in assessing users’ behavior at interaction time and also describes the results of a case study which analyzed users’ emotional responses while interacting with a game. We argue that capturing emotions during interaction time can help us in making changes on users’ behavior (e.g., changing from stressed to a less stressed state) or even suggesting an user to have a break. This can be all possible if both (1) emotions are captured during interaction and (2) changes are suggested at runtime (e.g., through persuasion). The results of this study suggest that there are significant differences between emotional responses captured during the interaction and those declared at the end. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",doi,10.1007/s00500-016-2115-0,Scopus,Soft Computing,"Gonçalves V.P., Giancristofaro G.T., Filho G.P.R., Johnson T., Carvalho V., Pessin G., Neris V.P.A., Ueyama J.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Assessment And Training In A 3-Dimensional Virtual Environment With Haptics: A Report On 5 Cases Of Motor Rehabilitation In The Chronic Stage After Stroke,"Objective. This exploratory study assessed the possible effectiveness of hemiparetic upper extremity training in subjects with chronic stroke with computer instrumentation (haptic force feedback) and 3-dimensional visualization applied to computer games, as well as to evaluate concurrent computer-assisted assessment of the kinematics of movements and test whether any improvement detected in the computer environment was reflected in activities of daily living (ADLs). Methods. A single-subject repeated-measures experimental design (AB) was used. After baseline testing, 5 patients were assigned to the therapy 3 times a week for 45 min for 5 weeks. Velocity, time needed to reach, and hand path ratio (reflecting superfluous movements) were the outcome measures, along with the Assessment of Motor and Process Skills and the Box and Block test. The follow-up phase (C) occurred 12 weeks later. Results. Improvements were noted in velocity, time, and hand path ratio. One patient showed improvement in occupational performance in ADLs. Conclusions.The application of this strategy of using virtual reality (VR) technologies may be useful in assessing and training stroke patients. The results of this study must be reproduced in further studies. The VR systems can be placed in homes or other nonclinical settings.

,Associated Factors Of Obesity In Spanish Representative Samples [Factores Asociados Al Padecimiento De Obesidad En Muestras Representativas De La Población Española],"Given the dramatic increase in the prevalence of obe - sity and the serious health and economic consequences, the scientific community, health professionals and health agencies are looking for the best strategies to prevent/ fight this trend. In order to plan the most appropriate intervention mea sures the first step is to identify the associated factors of obesity. This paper presents the results of research conducted/coordinated by our research team and promo - ted by the Spanish Food Safety Agency (AESAN), in the last five years. These studies were focussed on representative samples of the Spanish population, paying attention to the condition of overweight/obesity and their associated factors. The first study, FANPE (""Fuentes alimentarias de nu - trientes de la población española"") (2009), was centered in 418 adults (18-60 years) from 15 provinces (30 sam - pling points). Its aim was to analyze the dietary sources of nutrients, paying particular attention to sodium. This research showed that the risk of overweight/obesity in - crea ses with age, in people who have follow weight con - trol diets, in ex-smokers, married people and those who slept less than 8.5 hours per day, while the risk is lower in women, people who make sport and those with an University degree. It was also found that overweight people had higher sodium intake and urine excretion. Therefore, and having in mind that 88.2% of the subjects took more than 2 g/day of sodium (the maximum recommended), it is advised to lower the sodium intake not only from the health point of view but also as a probably strategy against obesity. The study ALADINO (Estudio de Alimentación, Acti - vidad física, Desarrollo Infantil y Obesidad- Study of the Diet, Physical Activity, Child Development and Obesity) (2010-2011) was focused on 7659 children (6-9 years) from 19 autonomous communities. We founded a higher percentage of overweight/obesity in boys than in girls, and a significant increase in the figures from the age of 7. Being overweight is more evident in offspring of parents with low educational level or low income, or if parents are smokers (especially when both parents smoke). The pro - blem increases in those children who skip breakfast, have in those with sports facilities far from their home, those who have a personal computer, video game or TV in their room, or those who sleep less than 8 hours per day. All these factors, either by themselves or because they influence eating habits and/or activity patterns, are associated with a higher risk of being overweight, so it must be monitored and modified in a more favourable direction, within the health policies of each country, as part of stra - tegies to halt the rise in obesity condition.",doi,10.3305/nh.2013.28.sup5.6918,Scopus,Nutricion Hospitalaria,"Ortega Anta R.M., López-Sobaler A.M., Pérez-Farinós N.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Associations Of Blood Pressure With Self-Report Measures Of Anger And Hostility Among Black And White Men And Women.,"This study examined associations between blood pressure (BP) and dispositional variables pertaining to anger and hostility. Black and White 25- to 44-year old male and female normotensives and unmedicated mild to moderate hypertensives completed four reliable self-report scales--the Cook-Medley Hostility (Ho) Scale, the Trait Anger subscale of the State-Trait Anger Scale (STAS-T), and the Cognitive Anger and Somatic Anger subscales of the Cognitive-Somatic Anger Scale--plus the Framingham Anger Scale and the Harburg Anger Scale. They also engaged in three laboratory tasks--Type A Structured Interview (SI), a video game, and a cold pressor task--that elicit cardiovascular reactivity. Ambulatory BP readings at home and at work were also obtained from most subjects. Blacks had significantly higher Ho and lower STAS-T scores than did Whites. Women reported higher levels of somatic anger than did men. White women showed significant positive correlations between STAS-T and systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) both at rest in the laboratory and during the SI. Black women revealed significant positive relationships between STAS-T and SBP and DBP at rest in the laboratory and at work as well as with DBP during the cold pressor test. For Black men, cognitive anger and DBP at rest were positively related. In contrast, White men revealed significant negative correlations between Ho scores and SBP at rest and during the video game; these men also showed significant negative relationships between somatic anger and SBP and DBP reactivity during the cold pressor test. Women, but not men, showed significant positive relationships between all four anger measures and ambulatory BP at work. Whereas main effects relating anger and cardiovascular measures were not apparent as a function of race, Blacks demonstrated significantly greater SBP and DBP reactivity than Whites during the cold pressor test, with the converse occurring during the SI. Men demonstrated significantly greater DBP reactivity than women during the video game. The present findings indicate that self-reports on anger/hostility measures and cardiovascular responses to behavioral tasks differ as a function of race but that relationships between anger and BP regulation need to take into account possible race-sex interactions and selection of anger/hostility measures.",doi,10.1037//0278-6133.8.5.557,Scopus,Health Psychology,"Durel L.A., Carver C.S., Spitzer S.B., Llabre M.M., Weintraub J.K., Saab P.G., Schneiderman N.",1989,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Automated Physical Activity Monitoring: Validation And Comparison With Physiological And Self‐Report Measures,"Physical activity can be assessed via self‐report, via physiological measures such as heart rate and oxygen uptake, or via automated monitor. An electronic accelerometer‐based physical activity device (Actigraph) has been reported as an improvement over other activity measurement techniques in terms of utility and accuracy. Four studies provide systematic validation and reliability testing for this device and comparisons with other techniques for assessing daily activities. In the first study, the sensitivity of the Actigraph was determined for differentiating physical activities (walking, running, stair climbing, knee bends) versus sedentary activities (reading, typing, playing video games, and performing a mental arithmetic task). Fifteen healthy adults wore the Actigraph on their wrist during activities; oxygen uptake and heart rate were simultaneously recorded. Results revealed that the Actigraph significantly differentiated between the physical activities (p < .0001) and the sedentary activities (p < .0001). Actigraph counts also correlated significantly with oxygen uptake (r= .73) and heart rate (r= .71) during physical activities (r= .46) and sedentary activities (r= .35), respectively. Test‐retest reliability was very high for 12 activities (r= .98). The high level of activity differentiation and strong relationship to oxygen uptake and heart rate suggest the usefulness of this device for behavioral and biomedical studies. However, these studies also indicate that the wrist may not always be the most adequate placement for indexing rate and intensity of daily activities and that further studies are needed to determine the optimal site of monitor attachment. Advantages and disadvantages of self‐report, physiological, and automated measures of activity are discussed. Copyright © 1993, Wiley Blackwell.

,Autonomic Microcell Assignment In Massively Distributed Online Virtual Environments,"Distributed virtual environments and massively multiplayer online games in particular have been on the rise for several years now. They offer huge digital environments characterized by tens of thousands of users interacting with each other. Efficiently managing these online worlds requires scalable architectures to distribute the load over multiple servers and maintain a high Quality of Experience (QoE). This need will only increase as online virtual worlds become more and more popular. A traditional approach to improve the scalability of this type of system is to statically partition the virtual world in smaller segments called cells, each assigned to a dedicated server. In this paper a novel approach of dividing the virtual world into even smaller parts called microcells is introduced. Critical in this approach are the algorithms that manage the microcell allocation over the available servers. These algorithms must face a number of challenges and have as a central goal to keep the load experienced by the servers below a given threshold. On one hand, clustering interacting microcells on one server allows to limit the overall load by minimizing the communication overhead. On the other hand, locating too many microcells on one server may cause the load to violate the threshold value, resulting in an overload situation. In this paper we present a number of algorithms that determine the microcell allocation and runtime adaptations of the microcell allocation to optimize the deployment. We evaluate the microcell approach by studying the impact of the microcell size and the number of servers. The efficiency of the algorithms in terms of their ability to decrease the maximum server load and their capability to maintain an ideal deployment in dynamic environments is also studied. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

,Bargaining Models Of Depression And Evolution Of Cooperation,"This paper presents a model for evolutionary origins of unipolar depressive disorders and reviews empirical evidence in support of the ""nonparticipation hypothesis of depression"" suggested by the model. In line with previous theory, depression is interpreted to provide means for not participating in joint enterprises that would otherwise be difficult to avoid ('bargaining' model); therefore, it provides an additional alternative strategy to social-imitation dynamics occurring in Public Good Games. Average income from joint enterprises modeled with a Public Good Game is interpreted to drive group-level genetic selection. Based on these assumptions, it is shown that if a joint enterprise is sufficiently important for both the between-individual and the between-groups competition, then a nonparticipation strategy (or gene for depression vulnerability) will be present in total population almost surely (i.e., with probability one). The modeling framework serves to explain several other seemingly unrelated empirical observations, such as association between income inequality and depression, co-morbidity and proximal biological mechanisms for negative emotions, and mechanisms for the social network-dynamics of emotion. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.jtbi.2013.04.012,Scopus,Journal of Theoretical Biology,Rosenström T.,2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Blend Shape Interpolation And Facs For Realistic Avatar,"Abstract: The quest of developing realistic facial animation is ever-growing. The emergence of sophisticated algorithms, new graphical user interfaces, laser scans and advanced 3D tools imparted further impetus towards the rapid advancement of complex virtual human facial model. Face-to-face communication being the most natural way of human interaction, the facial animation systems became more attractive in the information technology era for sundry applications. The production of computer-animated movies using synthetic actors are still challenging issues. Proposed facial expression carries the signature of happiness, sadness, angry or cheerful, etc. The mood of a particular person in the midst of a large group can immediately be identified via very subtle changes in facial expressions. Facial expressions being very complex as well as important nonverbal communication channel are tricky to synthesize realistically using computer graphics. Computer synthesis of practical facial expressions must deal with the geometric representation of the human face and the control of the facial animation. We developed a new approach by integrating blend shape interpolation (BSI) and facial action coding system (FACS) to create a realistic and expressive computer facial animation design. The BSI is used to generate the natural face while the FACS is employed to reflect the exact facial muscle movements for four basic natural emotional expressions such as angry, happy, sad and fear with high fidelity. The results in perceiving the realistic facial expression for virtual human emotions based on facial skin color and texture may contribute towards the development of virtual reality and game environment of computer aided graphics animation systems.Graphical Abstract: Realistic facial expressions of avatar. © 2015, 3D Research Center, Kwangwoon University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",doi,10.1007/s13319-015-0038-7,Scopus,3D Research,"Alkawaz M.H., Mohamad D., Basori A.H., Saba T.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Brain-Computer Interface Game Applications For Combined Neurofeedback And Biofeedback Treatment For Children On The Autism Spectrum,"Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) show deficits in social and communicative skills, including imitation, empathy, and shared attention, as well as restricted interests and repetitive patterns of behaviors. Evidence for and against the idea that dysfunctions in the mirror neuron system are involved in imitation and could be one underlying cause for ASD is discussed in this review. Neurofeedback interventions have reduced symptoms in children with ASD by self-regulation of brain rhythms. However, cortical deficiencies are not the only cause of these symptoms. Peripheral physiological activity, such as the heart rate and its variability, is closely linked to neurophysiological signals and associated with social engagement. Therefore, a combined approach targeting the interplay between brain, body, and behavior could be more effective. Brain-computer interface applications for combined neurofeedback and biofeedback treatment for children with ASD are currently nonexistent. To facilitate their use, we have designed an innovative game that includes social interactions and provides neural- and body-based feedback that corresponds directly to the underlying significance of the trained signals as well as to the behavior that is reinforced. © 2014 Friedrich, Suttie, Sivanathan, Lim, Louchart and Pineda.",doi,10.3389/fneng.2014.00021,Scopus,Frontiers in Neuroengineering,"Friedrich E.V.C., Suttie N., Sivanathan A., Lim T., Louchart S., Pineda J.A.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Brave New World Of Warcraft: A Conceptual Framework For Active Escapism,"Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the phenomenon of active escapism – a unique form of experiential consumption that engages fantasy and role-play as a means of coping. In contrast with passive forms of escapism, whereby consumers act as observers (e.g. watching a movie), active escapism provides consumers with the opportunity to directly interact with mediated realities, whether constructed in a virtual space (e.g. a video game) or the real world. Design/methodology/approach: Within the context of video game consumption, a conceptual framework for active escapism comprised antecedents, processes and consequences is established through literature review, depth interviews and naturalistic inquiry. Findings: The findings suggest that active escapism functions as a coping mechanism when consumers are confronted with external stressors that threaten either their sense of identity or control. While other forms of emotion-focused coping relieve stress through psychological avoidance (i.e. refocusing of attention away from stressors), active escapism provides the benefits of affirmation and empowerment through projective fantasy (i.e. role-play) and presence (i.e. immersion into a mediated reality). Originality/value: The conceptual framework established by this analysis gives insight into the structure of active escapism as a theoretical construct, providing a foundation for future research. Managerial implications for consumer escapism (e.g. branded in-game content) are discussed. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",doi,10.1108/JCM-04-2016-1775,Scopus,Journal of Consumer Marketing,"Kuo A., Lutz R.J., Hiler J.L.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Calculation Of Additional Heart Rates Using Oxygen Consumption And Carbon Dioxide Production: A Comparative Analysis,"Research, to date, on the occurrence of additional heart rates during behavioral stressors has employed oxygen consumption as the index of metabolic activity. Although this is the obvious first choice, in certain situations measures of carbon dioxide production may be more readily obtained. The analysis presented in this paper explored the intuitively appealing notion that, since oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production are themselves intimately related, carbon-dioxide-production measures may also be appropriate in the ""additional heart rate"" methodology. Data from the most recent additional-heart-rate paper by Turner and colleagues were thus reexamined, and additional heart rates during mental arithmetic and a video game were separately calculated for the 24 subjects by first using oxygen consumption and then by using carbon dioxide production. The values obtained were very highly correlated; the coefficients for the task: periods themselves were 0.99 and 0.96, respectively. Use of carbon-dioxide-production data-in this manner would, therefore, seem to be appropriate. © 1991 Psychonomic Society, Inc.",doi,10.3758/BF03203327,Scopus,"Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, & Computers","Thayer J.F., van Doornen L.J.P., Turner J.R.",1991,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Can Brain Games Help Smokers Quit?: Results Of A Randomized Clinical Trial,"Background and aims Deficits in cognitive function are observed during nicotine withdrawal and present a challenge to successful smoking cessation. This clinical trial evaluated a cognitive exercise training (CT) program to improve smoking cessation rates. Methods Adult treatment-seeking smokers (n = 213) were randomized to receive nicotine patch therapy and 12 weeks of either computerized CT or computerized relaxation (control) training. Smoking status was biochemically verified at the end of treatment and 6-month follow-up. Results Quit rates did not differ by treatment arm at either time-point, nor were there effects on withdrawal symptoms or smoking urges. Reaction time for emotion recognition and verbal interference tasks showed improvement in the CT group. When including only successful quitters, improvements in recognition memory, verbal interference accuracy, and attention switching error rate were also observed in the CT group, while commission errors on the continuous performance task decreased in the control group. Conclusions Despite modest changes in cognitive performance, these results do not support the efficacy of computerized cognitive training as an adjunctive therapy for smoking cessation. © 2016",doi,10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2016.08.621,Scopus,Drug and Alcohol Dependence,"Loughead J., Falcone M., Wileyto E.P., Albelda B., Audrain-McGovern J., Cao W., Kurtz M.M., Gur R.C., Lerman C.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Cardiac And Metabolic Activity In Mild Hypertensive And Normotensive Subjects,"Heart rate, respiration, and metabolic activity were monitored at rest and during the mental challenge of a video game in 22 mild hypertensive and 53 normotensive young men. Subjects also completed the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire and the Jenkins Activity Survey. The mild hypertensive subjects displayed higher resting heart rates than the normotensives and larger magnitude heart rate increases to the video game. Although groups did not differ in resting respiratory activity, the metabolic rates tended to be higher in the mild hypertensives and they showed reliably greater increases in oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production during mental challenge. These data were subjected to a variety of interpretations. However, in the absence of psychophysiological assessment during physical exertion, and without direct measurement of cardiao output and arteriovenous oxygen differences, the present results did not permit a choice to be made between rival explanations, and they certainly cannot discount the hypothesis that some borderline hypertensives display excessive cardiac activity and tissue overperfusion during stress. The personality measures did not differentiate groups. However, correlational analyses within each group revealed that whereas systolic blood pressure was positively and significantly related to neuroticism in the mild hypertensive group, for the normotensive subjects the direction of correlation was reversed. In addition, scores on the Jenkins Activity Survey correlated positively with heart rate reactivity to the video game for the mild hypertensives, but not for the normotensives.

,Cardiovascular And Affective Outcomes Of Active Gaming: Using The Nintendo Wii As A Cardiovascular Training Tool,"Naugle, KE, Naugle, KM, and Wikstrom, EA. Cardiovascular and affective outcomes of active gaming: Using the Nintendo Wii as a cardiovascular training tool. J Strength Cond Res 28(2): 443-451, 2014-Active-video gaming is purported to produce similar cardiovascular responses as aerobic fitness activities. This study compared the emotional and cardiovascular effects of Wii games with those of traditional exercise in college-aged adults with different exercise backgrounds. Specifically, the percentage of heart rate reserve, rate of perceived exertion (RPE), level of enjoyment, and Positive and Negative Affect Schedule scores were compared between subjects who reported exercising frequently at high intensities (high-intensity exerciser group: age = 20.18 years [0.87]; Height = 165.23 cm [9.97]; Mass = 62.37 kg [11.61]), N = 11 and those who exercise more often at lower intensities (low-intensity exercisers group: age = 20.72 years [1.19]; Height = 164.39 cm [8.05]; Mass = 68.04 kg [10.71]), N = 11. The subjects completed six 20-minute exercises sessions: treadmill walking, stationary cycling, and Wii's Tennis, Boxing, Cycling, and Step. The low-intensity exerciser group achieved a greater percentage of heart rate reserve (a) during traditional exercise compared with that during Wii boxing, (b) playing Wii boxing compared with that for Wii tennis, and (c) playing Wii boxing compared with that when the high-intensity exercisers group played any Wii games (p > 0.05). The RPE was greater for boxing and cycling compared with that for tennis and step (p > 0.05). Ratings of enjoyment and the increase in positive emotion were greater for boxing and for tennis compared with those for traditional exercises (p > 0.05). Results suggest that Wii boxing shows the greatest potential as a cardiovascular fitness tool among the Wii games, particularly for individuals who typically exercise at lower intensities. © 2014 National Strength and Conditioning Association.",doi,10.1519/JSC.0b1J13e3l829999c3,Scopus,Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research,"Naugle K.E., Naugle K.M., Wikstrom E.A.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Cardiovascular Effects In Adolescents While They Are Playing Video Games: A Potential Health Risk Factor?,"We analyzed heart rate (HR), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), oxygen consumption, and carbon dioxide production in 17 male adolescents during a racing simulation video game (VG) and compared to resting state (RS) and exercise testing (ET) measures. We were able to demonstrate a significant (p<.005) increase from RS to VG concerning HR (+13.1 bpm), SBP (+20.8 mmHg), and DBP (+12.1 mmHg) with SBP and DBP elevations exceeding 2 SD in all children and 14/17 children, respectively. The energy consumption during VG (max 1.71 kcal/min) was unaltered compared to RS and significantly lower compared to ET even at the starting strain of 25 W (1.94 kcal/min). Hemodynamic parameters tested demonstrated lower HR, unchanged SBP, and higher DBP during the VG compared with ET. Comparing all measured parameters it can be said that the relation of blood pressure and energy consumption during VG might not be favorable.

,Cardiovascular Reactivity In Anger-Defensive Individuals: The Influence Of Task Demands,"This study examined whether the elevated cardiovascular response to stressful stimuli previously suggested for individuals who are defensive in their reporting of anger might be moderated by the demands of the stressor task. Forty male undergraduates were exposed to four tasks: shock avoidance video game, handgrip, film, and cold pressor. Employing cluster analysis, defensive/low anger subjects were identified by high scores on the Marlowe- Crowne Social Desirability scale and low scores on the Spielberger Anger Expression and Trait Anger questionnaires. These individuals exhibited elevated heart rate and systolic blood pressure responses as compared with other subjects, but only to the shock avoidance task. Defensive/low anger subjects also reported less state anger to all tasks. It is proposed that an anger defensive style results in elevated cardiovascular activity only in interaction with stressors that elicit a sympathetic nervous system response and/or involve evaluation threat.",doi,10.1097/00006842-199301000-00013,Scopus,Psychosomatic Medicine,Miller S.B.,1993,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Cardiovascular Reactivity In Black And White Siblings Versus Matched Controls,"Elevated cardiovascular (CV) reactivity may be a marker or mechanism for the early development of essential hypertension (EH) and may contribute to the greater prevalence of EH observed in Black adults. Previous research has demonstrated that Black children show greater CV reactivity than White children to psychological stressors, however, the role of heritability in understanding these racial differences is still unknown. Evidence which supports a genetic influence on CV reactivity comes from animal studies, research on family history of EH, and from twin and sibling studies. The present study expands on previous findings by examining racial differences in CV reactivity in 15 pairs of Black siblings, 15 pairs of age-and sex-matched unrelated Black control subjects, 17 pairs of White siblings, and 17 pairs of age-and sex-matched unrelated White control subjects. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and heart rate (HR) measurements were obtained at rest and during a stress task (competitive video game). Black siblings demonstrated a significantly higher intraclass correlation for DBP reactivity than Black controls or White siblings (r=0.73, versus 0.16, 0.14, respectively). Additionally, Black siblings demonstrated a steeper rise and then a plateau in DBP and HR reactivity to the video game task, while White siblings showed a more gradual increase in these measures over the course of playing three video games. The results for DBP and HR reactivity, however, were not consistent among either of the matched control groups. These results expand on previous research by suggesting a stronger genetic influence of CV reactivity in Black than in White children. © 1995 The Society of Behavioral Medicine.",doi,10.1007/BF02903914,Scopus,Annals of Behavioral Medicine,"Wilson D.K., Holmes S.D., Arheart K., Alpert B.S.",1995,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Cardiovascular Reactivity To A New Mental Stress Test: The Maze Test,"The response to the maze test was studied in 31 subjects on no medication, including seven subjects with mild essential hypertension. Beat-by-beat finger blood pressure (BP) was measured with a Finapres device. Pulse interval from which heart rate (HR) was derived was obtained from the BP signal. A period of 5 min baseline was used to define resting levels of systolic BP and HR using 20-s averaged values for the calculation of the 95% confidence limit of the two variables. The average test duration was 10 min. During this period a series of video-displayed mazes had to be solved with easy mazes preceding difficult ones. No subject had been exposed to the test before. The maximal BP elevation associated with the test was 27 mmHg. The HR response averaged 11 beats/min. Significant elevations were observed for half the test duration. No significant relationship between these two responses was observed and some subjects exhibited isolated systolic BP or HR responses. When indices obtained during this active mental stress were compared to resting values, positive correlations were observed. When the resting standard deviation (SD) of systolic BP was higher the systolic response was greater. A similar relationship was observed for HR. In addition, when the systolic BP level at rest was higher, the systolic BP reactivity index was greater. However, systolic BP or HR at baseline were not predictive of the systolic BP or HR responses. This study demonstrates the applicability of a new test to assess cardiovascular reactivity. The main advantage of non-invasive continuous BP measurement with the Finapres is the ability to provide variability indices in addition to the peak responses. © 1995 Rapid Science Publishers.",doi,10.1007/BF01826196,Scopus,Clinical Autonomic Research,"Mounier-Vehier C., Girard A., Consoli S., Laude D., Vacheron A., Elghozi J.-L.",1995,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Cardiovascular Reactivity To Video Game Predicts Subsequent Blood Pressure Increases In Young Men: The Cardia Study,"Objective: This study was undertaken to determine the relationship between heightened reactivity of blood pressure (BP) during stress and 5- year changes in blood pressure and hypertensive status, using the CARDIA study. Method: A total of 3364 participants (910 white men, 909 white women, 678 black men, and 867 black women), initially 20 to 32 years old and normotensive, were included. Cardiovascular reactivity to psychological stressors (video game and star-tracing tasks for 3 minutes, cold pressor test for 1 minute) was measured in 1987-1988. We then examined reactivity as a predictor of significant BP change (≤8 mm Hg, thought to represent a clinically significant increase) over the next 5 years. Logistic regression models were used to control for potential covariates. Significant BP change and the development of hypertension (BP greater than 140/90 or taking medication for hypertension) over the 5-year follow-up were examined in separate analyses. Results: Increased systolic blood pressure (SBP) reactivity to the video game was associated with a significant 5-year SBP increase among the entire cohort, independent of resting SBP (p < .0001). Subsequent analyses showed that this relationship held for men but not for women. Reactivity to the star-tracing task or the cold pressor test did not predict significant BP change. Among black men only, new hypertensives (N = 36) had greater diastolic blood pressure (DBP) reactivity to the video game (p = .01). Conclusions: Although BP reactivity to all physical and mental stressors used in this study did not consistently predict 5-year change in BP in this young cohort, the results indicate that reactivity to a video game stressor predicts 5-year change in BP and early hypertension among young adult men. These findings are consistent with other studies showing the usefulness of stressors producing a primarily β-adrenergic response in predicting BP change and hypertension. The results may be limited by the shortened initial rest and recovery periods used in the CARDIA protocol.",doi,10.1097/00006842-199803000-00014,Scopus,Psychosomatic Medicine,"Markovitz J.H., Raczynski J.M., Wallace D., Chettur V., Chesney M.A.",1998,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Cardiovascular Responses To An Extended Aversive Video Game Task,"Active coping stressors, which tend to produce increases in cardiac output disproportionate to metabolic need, may elicit compensatory autoregulatory responses elevating peripheral resistance if exposure is prolonged. Two studies (total N=24) were conducted in which healthy male undergraduates participated in both one‐hour shock avoidance and separate counterbalanced baseline sessions. In an attempt to maximize subject involvement, a somewhat unconventional, complex shock avoidance procedure was employed. The subject could avoid mild electric shocks depending on video game performance. The primary dependent measures were heart rate, digital blood volume pulse (DBVP), and blood pressure. In both studies, most subjects exhibited immediate and pronounced increases in heart rate in response to the stressor, followed by some habituation. In contrast, DBVP responses did not usually habituate. Similarly, blood pressure was more or less constantly elevated by the stressor. The results of multiple regression analyses indicated that individual differences in mean arterial blood pressure response to the stressor were significantly related to individual differences in heart rate response to the first 15 minutes, but increasingly unrelated to heart rate response, and more related to DBVP response, as the session progressed.

,Changes In Hemodynamic Response To Mental Stress With Heart Rate Feedback Training,"This study was designed to examine underlying hemodynamic changes that accompany observed reductions in heart rate (HR) response to mental stress following HR feedback training. Twenty-five college males, assigned to either a HR feedback training group (FB+) or a control group (FB-), were presented with a videogame and mental arithmetic challenge, as HR, blood pressure, and impedance cardiography-derived measures of hemodynamic functioning were recorded. During training, the FB+ group received HR feedback and the FB- group was not provided with HR feedback while playing a videogame. At posttraining, results revealed that the FB+ group exhibited significantly lower HR, systolic blood pressure, stroke volume, and total peripheral resistance responses to the videogame compared to that at pretraining. There was no evidence that the acquired skills generalized to a mental arithmetic task. These results suggest that HR feedback training is an effective method for reducing cardiovascular and hemodynamic responses to a mental stressor; however, the generalizability of this effect remains questionable.",doi,10.1023/A:1013101820240,Scopus,Applied Psychophysiology Biofeedback,"Goodie J.L., Larkin K.T.",2001,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Changes In Sympathetic Tone During Cooperative Game Play,"We investigated the relationship between stress (specifically, sympathetic tone) and effective and efficient cooperation between partners using a cooperative version of a Tetris game as a model of limited resources in a shared environment. Participants were recruited from 2 distinct sociocultural orientations: individualism (Americans) and collectivism (Japanese). We compared the frequency domain of heart rate variability (HRV) and average scores on the short form of the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (I-PANAS-SF) for individuals and dyad partners. Japanese players cooperated more effectively and their scores on the positive subscale of the I-PANAS-SF for both self and partner were higher than those of American players. However, Japanese participants experienced more stress, as indicated by an increased low-to-high HRV frequency ratio. Our results suggest that sociocultural orientation affects the motivation to promote prosocial interactions that result in efficiency and effectiveness of cooperation. © Society for Personality Research.",doi,10.2224/sbp.2015.43.7.1123,Scopus,Social Behavior and Personality,"Adam Noah J., Ono Y., Shimada S., Tachibana A., Bronner S.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,"Children, Video Games And Physical Activity: An Exploratory Study","Media consumption and video gameplay can contribute to a sedentary lifestyle. Nevertheless, video games may have the potential to actually enhance children's physical activity. Objective: To explore the potential of video games to contribute to children's health and physical activity. Study Group: Twelve British children (seven female, five male) aged 8-11 years. Methods'. Th children participated in daily video-game play during school lunch times for one week. Focus group interviews were employed, pre and post the game play week, to examine children's perceptions of video games in relation to physical activity and health. Physical activity was assessed during all game play periods using pedometry and heart rate monitoring. Results: Pre the game play period, all children reported that video games had a negative impact on health and physical activity. Post game play, children reported that active video gameplay was an attractive alternative to traditional forms of physical activity that might be more attractive to nonexercisers. The results during the gameplay period revealed that boys and girls accumulated 10% and 11% of the recommended number of steps/day for health and also engaged in an average of 11 minutes (or 46% of the monitoring period) sustained moderate to vigorous physical activity through active video gaming each day. Conclusions: Although video games have traditionally been regarded as a negative influence on children's physical activity, active video games may provide a viable alternative to traditional physical activity. Even a short duration of daily active video-game play can contribute significantly to children achieving the recommended daily volume of physical activity. © 2011, Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co.

,Chill-Inducing Music Enhances Altruism In Humans,"Music is a universal feature of human cultures, and it has both fascinated and troubled many researchers. In this paper we show through the Dictator Game that an individual's listening to preferred ""chill-inducing"" music may promote altruistic behavior that extends beyond the bounds of kin selection or reciprocal altruism. Participants were 22 undergraduate and postgraduate students who were divided into two groups, the In-group (IG) and the Out-group (OG), and they acted as dictators. The dictators listened to their own preferred ""chill-inducing"" music, to music they disliked, or to silence, and then played the Dictator Game. In this hypothetical experiment, the dictators were given real money (which they did not keep) and were asked to distribute it to the recipients, who were presented as stylized images of men and women displayed on a computer screen. The dictators played the Dictator Game both before and after listening to the music. Both male and female dictators gave more money after listening to their preferred music and less after listening to the music they disliked, whereas silence had no effect on the allocated amounts. The group to which the recipient belonged did not influence these trends. The results suggest that listening to preferred ""chill-inducing"" music promotes altruistic behavior. © 2014 Fukui and Toyoshima.",doi,10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01215,Scopus,Frontiers in Psychology,"Fukui H., Toyoshima K.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Choosing To Be Afraid: Preferences For Fear As A Function Of Goal Pursuit,"According to an instrumental approach to emotion regulation (M. Tamir, in press), people may not always prefer to feel pleasant emotions and avoid unpleasant ones. Instead, they may be motivated to experience even unpleasant emotions when they might be useful for goal attainment. Given that fear serves to promote successful avoidance, these studies tested this hypothesis by examining preferences for fear in preparation for avoidance goal pursuits. Consistent with the predictions of the instrumental approach, participants preferred to increase their level of fear as they prepared to pursue an avoidance goal. Such preferences were higher than preferences for either excitement or anger and were unique to avoidance (vs. approach or confrontational) goal pursuits. Given the aversive nature of fear, these findings clearly demonstrate that people may sometimes prefer to feel bad if doing so can lead to instrumental benefits. © 2009 American Psychological Association.",doi,10.1037/a0015882,Scopus,Emotion,"Tamir M., Ford B.Q.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas

Because input data was in free-text format, we used a natural language processing text classifier to automatically classify free-text triage chief complaints into syndromic categories used by the biosurveillance system. The classifier was trained on 4700 chief complaints from Pennsylvania. We evaluated the ability of the classifier to classify free-text chief complaints into syndromic categories with a test set of 800 chief complaints from Utah. Results: The classifier produced the following areas under the ROC curve: Constitutional = 0.95; Gastrointestinal = 0.97; Hemorrhagic = 0.99; Neurological = 0.96; Rash = 1.0; Respiratory = 0.99; Other = 0.96. Using information stored in the system's semantic model, we extracted from the Respiratory classifications lower respiratory complaints and lower respiratory complaints with fever with a precision of 0.97 and 0.96, respectively. Conclusion: Results suggest that a trainable natural language processing text classifier can accurately extract data from free-text chief complaints for biosurveillance. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

,Co-Constructing An Agent-Based Model To Mediate Land Use Conflict Between Herders And Foresters In Northern Thailand,"In conservation areas, land use conflicts frequently occur due to the increasing number of land resource managers and users who usually have different interests, objectives and perceptions. Sharing all these a priori legitimate differences is a prerequisite for better collective management of the land. The companion modelling approach is used to build a shared representation of interactions between vegetation dynamics, reforestation efforts and livestock grazing in a forest conservation area of northern Thailand. This article focuses on the participatory modelling process that led to the co-construction of an agent-based model. Sensitizing exercises on vegetation dynamics and an agent-based simulator associated with a role-playing game were the main tools used. The social interactions and decision-making processes observed during the gaming and simulation sessions were used to construct a set of rules implemented in a subsequent autonomous agent-based model. It will be used to simulate future land management scenarios with local stakeholders. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.",doi,10.1080/1747423X.2011.558596,Scopus,Journal of Land Use Science,"Dumrongrojwatthana P., Le Page C., Gajaseni N., Trébuil G.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Cognitive Improvement Of Schizophrenia Patients: Enhancing Cognition While Enjoying Computer-Aided Cognitive Training,"Cognitive deficits are a core symptom in schizophrenia, but until now controlled efficacy studies of cognitive training methods have shown inconclusive results. This study examined the effects of computer-aided cognitive training using motivational software that evokes positive emotions in patients suffering from schizophrenia. Forty patients were included: twenty of them received cognitive training; twenty received occupational therapy. Both before and after treatment, all patients were assessed with a battery of neuropsychological tests measuring executive functions, attention and verbal memory. Enhancing effects on executive functioning level and verbal memory could be found. At the same time, effects on positive and negative symptom levels could be observed. Changes in symptom levels and cognitive improvement were uncorrelated. Our findings imply that cognitive achievement of schizophrenia patients can be improved using pleasant and ""game-like"" cognitive training tasks. This may be due to a motivating effect and, to a greater extent, because these tasks cause enhanced processing.",doi,10.3371/CSRP.1.4.2,Scopus,Clinical Schizophrenia and Related Psychoses,"Trapp W., Hasmann A., Gallhofer B., Schwerdtner J., Guenther W., Dobmeier M.",2008,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Collaborative Sub-Channel Allocation In Cognitive Lte Femto-Cells: A Cooperative Game-Theoretic Approach,"In this paper, formation of stable coalitions of users, each exploiting resources in a femto-cell, and the resource allocation in each femto-cell is investigated in a UMTS long term evolution (LTE) network. We study a downlink scenario where users collaborate to increase network throughput and, simultaneously, attempt to increase their own payoffs. Payoffs to the users are defined as the monetary equivalent of the individual users' achievable throughput in the specified coalition structure. A distributed game-theoretic resource allocation mechanism is developed whereby users autonomously decide which sub-channel in which coalition to join. If each user operates according to the proposed algorithm, the sum throughput of all links converges with probability one to its maximum feasible value. © 1972-2012 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TCOMM.2012.100312.110480,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Communications,"Gharehshiran O.N., Attar A., Krishnamurthy V.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Combining Computer Game-Based Behavioural Experiments With High-Density Eeg And Infrared Gaze Tracking,"Experimental paradigms are valuable insofar as the timing and other parameters of their stimuli are well specified and controlled, and insofar as they yield data relevant to the cognitive processing that occurs under ecologically valid conditions. These two goals often are at odds, since well controlled stimuli often are too repetitive to sustain subjects' motivation. Studies employing electroencephalography (EEG) are often especially sensitive to this dilemma between ecological validity and experimental control: attaining sufficient signal-to-noise in physiological averages demands large numbers of repeated trials within lengthy recording sessions, limiting the subject pool to individuals with the ability and patience to perform a set task over and over again. This constraint severely limits researchers' ability to investigate younger populations as well as clinical populations associated with heightened anxiety or attentional abnormalities. Even adult, non-clinical subjects may not be able to achieve their typical levels of performance or cognitive engagement: an unmotivated subject for whom an experimental task is little more than a chore is not the same, behaviourally, cognitively, or neurally, as a subject who is intrinsically motivated and engaged with the task. A growing body of literature demonstrates that embedding experiments within video games may provide a way between the horns of this dilemma between experimental control and ecological validity. The narrative of a game provides a more realistic context in which tasks occur, enhancing their ecological validity (Chaytor & Schmitter-Edgecombe, 2003). Moreover, this context provides motivation to complete tasks. In our game, subjects perform various missions to collect resources, fend off pirates, intercept communications or facilitate diplomatic relations. In so doing, they also perform an array of cognitive tasks, including a Posner attention-shifting paradigm (Posner, 1980), a go/no-go test of motor inhibition, a psychophysical motion coherence threshold task, the Embedded Figures Test (Witkin, 1950, 1954) and a theory-of-mind (Wimmer & Perner, 1983) task. The game software automatically registers game stimuli and subjects' actions and responses in a log file, and sends event codes to synchronise with physiological data recorders. Thus the game can be combined with physiological measures such as EEG or fMRI, and with moment-to-moment tracking of gaze. Gaze tracking can verify subjects' compliance with behavioural tasks (e.g. fixation) and overt attention to experimental stimuli, and also physiological arousal as reflected in pupil dilation (Bradley et al., 2008). At great enough sampling frequencies, gaze tracking may also help assess covert attention as reflected in microsaccades - eye movements that are too small to foveate a new object, but are as rapid in onset and have the same relationship between angular distance and peak velocity as do saccades that traverse greater distances. The distribution of directions of microsaccades correlates with the (otherwise) covert direction of attention (Hafed & Clark, 2002). © JoVE 2006-2011.

,Comfortably Numb: Desensitizing Effects Of Violent Media On Helping Others.,"Two studies tested the hypothesis that exposure to violent media reduces aid offered to people in pain. In Study 1, participants played a violent or nonviolent video game for 20 min. After game play, while completing a lengthy questionnaire, they heard a loud fight, in which one person was injured, outside the lab. Participants who played violent games took longer to help the injured victim, rated the fight as less serious, and were less likely to “hear” the fight in comparison to participants who played nonviolent games. In Study 2, violent- and nonviolent-movie attendees witnessed a young woman with an injured ankle struggle to pick up her crutches outside the theater either before or after the movie. Participants who had just watched a violent movie took longer to help than participants in the other three conditions.

,Comparing Expert Driving Behavior In Real World And Simulator Contexts,"Computer games are increasingly used for purposes beyond mere entertainment, and current hi-tech simulators can provide quite, naturalistic contexts for purposes such as traffic education. One of the critical concerns in this area is the validity or transferability of acquired skills from a simulator to the real world context. In this paper, we present our work in which we compared driving in the real world with that in the simulator at two levels, that is, by using performance measures alone, and by combining psychophysiological measures with performance measures. For our study, we gathered data using questionnaires as well as by logging vehicle dynamics, environmental conditions, video data, and users' psychophysiological measurements. For the analysis, we used several novel approaches such as scatter plots to visualize driving tasks of different contexts and to obtain vigilance estimators from electroencephalographic (EEG) data in order to obtain important results about the differences between the driving in the two contexts. Our belief is that both experimental procedures and findings of our experiment are very important to the field of serious games concerning how to evaluate the fitness of driving simulators and measure driving performance. © 2013 Hiran B.

,Comparison Between Nintendo Wii Fit Aerobics And Traditional Aerobic Exercise In Sedentary Young Adults.,"Exergaming is becoming a popular recreational activity for young adults. The purpose was to compare the physiologic and psychological responses of college students playing Nintendo Wii Fit, an active video game console, vs. an equal duration of moderate-intensity brisk walking. Twenty-one healthy sedentary college-age students (mean age 23.2 ± 1.8 years) participated in a randomized, double cross-over study, which compared physiologic and psychological responses to 30 minutes of brisk walking exercise on a treadmill vs. 30 minutes playing Nintendo Wii Fit ""Free Run"" program. Physiologic parameters measured included heart rate, rate pressure product, respiratory rate, and rating of perceived exertion. Participants' positive well-being, psychological distress, and level of fatigue associated with each exercise modality were quantified using the Subjective Exercise Experience Scale. The mean maximum heart rate (HRmax) achieved when exercising with Wii Fit (142.4 ± 20.5 b·min(-1)) was significantly greater (p = 0.001) compared with exercising on the treadmill (123.2 ± 13.7 b·min(-1)). Rate pressure product was also significantly greater (p = 0.001) during exercise on the Wii Fit. Participants' rating of perceived exertion when playing Wii Fit (12.7 ± 3.0) was significantly greater (p = 0.014) when compared with brisk walking on the treadmill (10.1 ± 3.3). However, psychologically when playing Wii Fit, participants' positive well-being decreased significantly (p = 0.018) from preexercise to postexercise when compared with exercising on the treadmill. College students have the potential to surpass exercise intensities achieved when performing a conventional standard for moderate-intensity exercise when playing Nintendo Wii Fit ""Free Run"" with a self-selected intensity. We concluded that Nintendo Wii Fit ""Free Run"" may act as an alternative to traditional moderate-intensity aerobic exercise in fulfilling the American College of Sports Medicine requirements for physical activity.",doi,10.1519/JSC.0b013e31822e5967,pubmed,Journal of strength and conditioning research,"Douris, Peter C; McDonald, Brittany; Vespi, Frank; Kelley, Nancy C; Herman, Lawrence",2012,NA,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Components Of Type A Behavior Pattern As Predictors Of Neuroendocrine And Cardiovascular Reactivity In Challenging Tasks,"This study was designed to test the association between (a) components of the Type A behavior pattern, measured by survey and structured interview (SI), and (b) sympatho-adrenal activation, indexed by urinary catecholamines, pituitary-adrenal responsiveness measured by salivary cortisol, cardiovascular activation measured by heart rate (HR) and pulse transit time (PTT), and renal sodium excretion. Sixteen subjects, balanced for gender, were recruited from a random sample of 100 university students. They presented a stratified distribution of responses to the Jenkins Activity Survey (JAS) for Type A behavior assessment. The subjects volunteered in a challenging laboratory session that included the performance of a video game (Video) and the SI for Type A behavior assessment. Generally, Reactivity and Recovery scores for dopamine (D) and adrenaline (A) were positively correlated with such scores for sodium in particular, and were negatively correlated with salivary changes of cortisol (Table 1). The highest levels of significance for univariate F-tests were obtained from Cardiovascular Reactivity and Recovery measures and for dopamine and adrenaline measures when groups were formed by a median criterion to Global Type A assessed by the SI: Hostility plus Time Urgency. Discriminant analyses of Reactivity variables were most successful in classification of Type A and Type B groups when (a) D, A, noradrenaline (NA), HR, and PTT scores were combined as a discriminant model with SI-scores for Global Type A (Table 2), whereas Recovery scores for cardiovascular, or cardiovascular plus catecholamine variables, related to the Global Type A criterion (Table 3). The factor identified as Hard-Driving and Competitive (JAS) yielded 100% correct classification provided cortisol was added to these variables. High and low Dysphoria groups were perfectly identified by a model incorporating catecholamines, cardiovascular, and cortisol Recovery measures (Table 4), and Dysphoric Type As showed high Reactivity scores to challenge (Table 5). The results lent support to an association between the Hostile/Irritable components of the Type A construct and cardio-sympatho-adrenal activation including dopamine. Salivary cortisol Reactivity scores were associated with Type A Dysphoria. © 1992.",doi,10.1016/0191-8869(92)90244-J,Scopus,Personality and Individual Differences,"Svebak S., Knardahl S., Nordby H., Aakvaag A.",1992,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Compromised Prefrontal Cognitive Control Over Emotional Interference In Adolescents With Internet Gaming Disorder,"Increased reports of impulsivity and aggression in male adolescents with Internet gaming might reflect their dysfunction in emotion regulation, particularly in suppression of negative emotions, which should affect the various stages of Internet gaming disorder. This study tested the hypothesis that adolescents with Internet gaming disorder would be more disturbed by the emotional interference and demonstrate compromised dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) activation during a Stroop Match-to-Sample task. In addition, functional connectivity analysis was conducted to examine the interplays between neural correlates involved in emotional processing and how they were altered in adolescents with Internet gaming disorder. The Internet gaming disorder group demonstrated weaker dACC activation and stronger insular activations to interfering angry facial stimuli compared with the healthy control group. Negative functional connectivity between stronger insular activation and weaker dorsolateral prefrontal activation correlated with higher cognitive impulsivity in adolescents with Internet gaming disorder. These findings provide evidence of the compromised prefrontal cognitive control over emotional interference in adolescents with Internet gaming disorder. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2015.",doi,10.1089/cyber.2015.0231,Scopus,"Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking","Lee J., Lee S., Chun J.W., Cho H., Kim D.-J., Jung Y.-C.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Compulsivity Across The Pathological Misuse Of Drug And Non-Drug Rewards,"Behavioral adaptation is required for the successful navigation of a constantly changing environment. Impairments in behavioral flexibility are commonly observed in psychiatric disorders including those of addiction. This study investigates two distinct facets of compulsivity, namely reversal learning and attentional set shifting, implicating orbitofrontal and lateral prefrontal regions respectively, across disorders of primary and secondary rewards. Obese subjects with and without binge eating disorder (BED), individuals with compulsive sexual behaviors (CSB), alcohol dependence (AD) and pathological video-gaming (VG) were tested with two computerized tasks: the probabilistic reversal task (trials to criterion and win-stay/lose-shift errors) and the intra/extra-dimensional set shift task (IED). Individuals with AD and pathological VG were slower at reversal learning irrespective of valence, with AD subjects more likely to perseverate after losses. Compared to obese subjects without BED, BED subjects were worse at reversal learning to wins but better at losses highlighting valence effects as a function of binge eating. CSB subjects demonstrated enhanced sensitivity to reward outcomes with faster acquisition and greater perseveration with higher magnitude rewards. We further show an impairment in attentional set shifting in individuals with BED and AD relative to healthy volunteers (HV). This study provides evidence for commonalities and differences in two distinct dimensions of behavioral inflexibility across disorders of compulsivity. We summarize studies on compulsivity subtypes within this same patient population. We emphasize commonalities in AD and BED with impairments across a range of compulsivity indices, perhaps supporting pathological binge eating as a form of behavioral addiction. We further emphasize commonalities in reversal learning across disorders and the crucial role of valence effects. These findings highlight the role of behavioral inflexibility and compulsivity as a relevant domain in defining dimensional psychiatry and the identification of relevant cognitive endophenotypes as targets for therapeutic modulation. © 2016 Banca, Harrison and Voon.",doi,10.3389/fnbeh.2016.00154,Scopus,Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience,"Banca P., Harrison N.A., Voon V.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Computational Substrates Of Norms And Their Violations During Social Exchange,"Social norms in humans constrain individual behaviors to establish shared expectations within a social group. Previous work has probed social norm violations and the feelings that such violations engender; however, a computational rendering of the underlying neural and emotional responses has been lacking. We probed norm violations using a two-party, repeated fairness game (ultimatum game) where proposers offer a split of a monetary resource to a responder who either accepts or rejects the offer. Using a norm-training paradigm where subject groups are preadapted to either high or low offers, we demonstrate that unpredictable shifts in expected offers creates a difference in rejection rates exhibited by the two responder groups for otherwise identical offers. We constructed an ideal observer model that identified neural correlates of norm prediction errors in the ventral striatum and anterior insula, regions that also showed strong responses to variance-prediction errors generated by the same model. Subjective feelings about offers correlated with these norm prediction errors, and the two signals displayed overlapping, but not identical, neural correlates in striatum, insula, and medial orbito-frontal cortex. These results provide evidence for the hypothesis that responses in anterior insula can encode information about social norm violations that correlate with changes in overt behavior (changes in rejection rates). Together, these results demonstrate that the brain regions involved in reward prediction and risk prediction are also recruited in signaling social norm violations. © 2013 the authors.",doi,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1642-12.2013,Scopus,Journal of Neuroscience,"Xiang T., Lohrenz T., Montague P.R.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Computer-Assisted Design For Scaling Up Systems Based On Dna Reaction Networks,"In the past few years, there have been many exciting advances in the field of molecular programming, reaching a point where implementation of non-trivial systems, such as neural networks or switchable bistable networks, is a reality. Such systems require nonlinearity, be it through signal amplification, digitalization or the generation of autonomous dynamics such as oscillations. The biochemistry of DNA systems provides such mechanisms, but assembling them in a constructive manner is still a difficult and sometimes counterintuitive process. Moreover, realistic prediction of the actual evolution of concentrations over time requires a number of side reactions, such as leaks, cross-talks or competitive interactions, to be taken into account. In this case, the design of a system targeting a given function takes much trial and error before the correct architecture can be found. To speed up this process, we have created DNA Artificial Circuits Computer-Assisted Design (DACCAD), a computer-assisted design software that supports the construction of systems for the DNA toolbox. DACCAD is ultimately aimed to design actual in vitro implementations, which is made possible by building on the experimental knowledge available on the DNA toolbox. We illustrate its effectiveness by designing various systems, from Montagne et al.'s Oligator or Padirac et al.'s bistable system to new and complex networks, including a two-bit counter or a frequency divider as well as an example of very large system encoding the game Mastermind. In the process, we highlight a variety of behaviours, such as enzymatic saturation and load effect, which would be hard to handle or even predict with a simpler model. We also show that those mechanisms, while generally seen as detrimental, can be used in a positive way, as functional part of a design. Additionally, the number of parameters included in these simulations can be large, especially in the case of complex systems. For this reason, we included the possibility to use CMA-ES, a state-of-the-art optimization algorithm that will automatically evolve parameters chosen by the user to try to match a specified behaviour. Finally, because all possible functionality cannot be captured by a single software, DACCAD includes the possibility to export a system in the synthetic biology markup language, a widely used language for describing biological reaction systems.

,Computer Poker: A Review,"The game of poker has been identified as a beneficial domain for current AI research because of the properties it possesses such as the need to deal with hidden information and stochasticity. The identification of poker as a useful research domain has inevitably resulted in increased attention from academic researchers who have pursued many separate avenues of research in the area of computer poker. The poker domain has often featured in previous review papers that focus on games in general, however a comprehensive review paper with a specific focus on computer poker has so far been lacking in the literature. In this paper, we present a review of recent algorithms and approaches in the area of computer poker, along with a survey of the autonomous poker agents that have resulted from this research. We begin with the first serious attempts to create strong computerised poker players by constructing knowledge-based and simulation-based systems. This is followed by the use of computational game theory to construct robust poker agents and the advances that have been made in this area. Approaches to constructing exploitive agents are reviewed and the challenging problems of creating accurate and dynamic opponent models are addressed. Finally, we conclude with a selection of alternative approaches that have received attention in previously published material and the interesting problems that they pose. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Autonomic response also reflected the degree of interruption/discrepancy produced by an event. Negatively toned (discrepant) events tended to produce significant intensity and higher overall autonomic arousal.

,Content And Task-Based View Selection From Multiple Video Streams,"We present a content-aware multi-camera selection technique that uses object- and frame-level features. First objects are detected using a color-based change detector. Next trajectory information for each object is generated using multi-frame graph matching. Finally, multiple features including size and location are used to generate an object score. At frame-level, we consider total activity, event score, number of objects and cumulative object score. These features are used to generate score information using a multivariate Gaussian distribution. The algorithm. The best view is selected using a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN), which utilizes camera network information. DBN employs previous view information to select the current view thus increasing resilience to frequent switching. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated on three multi-camera setups with semi-overlapping fields of view: a basketball game, an indoor airport surveillance scenario and a synthetic outdoor pedestrian dataset. We compare the proposed view selection approach with a maximum score based camera selection criterion and demonstrate a significant decrease in camera flickering. The performance of the proposed approach is also validated through subjective testing. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",doi,10.1007/s11042-009-0355-z,Scopus,Multimedia Tools and Applications,"Daniyal F., Taj M., Cavallaro A.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Context-Sensitive Affect Recognition For A Robotic Game Companion,"Social perception abilities are among the most important skills necessary for robots to engage humans in natural forms of interaction. Affect-sensitive robots are more likely to be able to establish and maintain believable interactions over extended periods of time. Nevertheless, the integration of affect recognition frameworks in real-time human-robot interaction scenarios is still underexplored. In this article, we propose and evaluate a context-sensitive affect recognition framework for a robotic game companion for children. The robot can automatically detect affective states experienced by children in an interactive chess game scenario. The affect recognition framework is based on the automatic extraction of task features and social interaction-based features. Vision-based indicators of the children's nonverbal behaviour are merged with contextual features related to the game and the interaction and given as input to support vector machines to create a context-sensitive multimodal system for affect recognition. The affect recognition framework is fully integrated in an architecture for adaptive human-robot interaction. Experimental evaluation showed that children's affect can be successfully predicted using a combination of behavioural and contextual data related to the game and the interaction with the robot. It was found that contextual data alone can be used to successfully predict a subset of affective dimensions, such as interest toward the robot. Experiments also showed that engagement with the robot can be predicted using information about the user's valence, interest and anticipatory behaviour. These results provide evidence that social engagement can be modelled as a state consisting of affect and attention components in the context of the interaction. © 2014 ACM.",doi,10.1145/2622615,Scopus,ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems,"Castellano G., Leite I., Pereira A., Martinho C., Paiva A., McOwan P.W.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Context Conditioning In Humans Using Commercially Available Immersive Virtual Reality,"Despite a wealth of knowledge on how humans and nonhuman animals learn to associate meaningful events with cues in the environment, far less is known about how humans learn to associate these events with the environment itself. Progress on understanding spatiotemporal contextual processes in humans has been slow in large measure by the methodological constraint of generating and manipulating immersive spatial environments in well-controlled laboratory settings. Fortunately, immersive Virtual Reality (iVR) technology has improved appreciably and affords a relatively straightforward methodology to investigate the role of context on learning, memory, and emotion while maintaining experimental control. Here, we review context conditioning literature in humans and describe challenges to study contextual learning in humans. We then provide details for a novel context threat (fear) conditioning paradigm in humans using a commercially available VR headset and a cross-platform game engine. This paradigm resulted in the acquisition of subjective threat, threat-conditioned defensive responses, and explicit threat memory. We make the paradigm publicly available and describe obstacles and solutions to optimize future studies of context conditioning using iVR. As computer technology advances to replicate the sensation of realistic environments, there are increasing opportunities to bridge the translational gap between rodent and human research on how context modulates cognition, which may ultimately lead to more optimal treatment strategies for anxiety- and stress-related disorders. © 2017 The Author(s).",doi,10.1038/s41598-017-08184-7,Scopus,Scientific Reports,"Kroes M.C.W., Dunsmoor J.E., Mackey W.E., McClay M., Phelps E.A.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas

,Cooperation Dynamics On Collaborative Social Networks Of Heterogeneous Population,"In collaborative social networks (CSNs), autonomous individuals cooperate for their common reciprocity interests. The intrinsic heterogeneity of individuals' capability and willingness makes significant impact on the promotion of cooperation rate. In this paper, we propose a two-phase Heterogeneous Public Goods Game (HPGG) model to study the cooperation dynamics in CSNs. We introduce two factors to represent the heterogeneity of individual behaviors and the benefit-to-cost enhancement of population, respectively. Based on HPGG CSN model, we quantitatively investigate the relationship between cooperation rate and individuals' heterogeneous behaviors from an evolutionary game perspective. Simulations on the population structure of scale-free networks show the evolution of cooperation in CSNs has no-trivial dependence on the individuals' heterogeneous behaviors. Compared with standard PGG and single-phase heterogeneous PGG, HPGG provides a more precise mechanism to promote cooperation rate of CSNs. Finally, data traces collected from real experiments also demonstrate the preciseness of HPGG in formulating the cooperation dynamics on CSNs. © 1983-2012 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/JSAC.2013.130615,Scopus,IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications,"Wei G., Zhu P., Vasilakos A.V., Mao Y., Luo J., Ling Y.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,"Correlates And Consequences Of Exposure To Videogame Violence: Hostile Personality, Empathy, And Aggressive Behavior.","Research has shown that exposure to violent video games causes increases in aggression, but the mechanisms of this effect have remained elusive. Also, potential differences in short-term and long-term exposure are not well understood. An initial correlational study shows that video game violence exposure (VVE) is positively correlated with self-reports of aggressive behavior and that this relation is robust to controlling for multiple aspects of personality. A lab experiment showed that individuals low in VVE behave more aggressively after playing a violent video game than after a nonviolent game but that those high in VVE display relatively high levels of aggression regardless of game content. Mediational analyses show that trait hostility, empathy, and hostile perceptions partially account for the VVE effect on aggression. These findings suggest that repeated exposure to video game violence increases aggressive behavior in part via changes in cognitive and personality factors associated with desensitization.",doi,10.1177/0146167205277205,anderson2010,Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin,"Bartholow, B.

,Cortisol Effects On Flow-Experience,"Rationale: Stress affects flow-experience, but the mediating psychobiological mechanisms remain unknown. Previous studies showed an association between flow-experience and endogenous cortisol levels, suggesting an inverted, u-shaped relation between flow-experience and cortisol. However, these studies could not exclude effects of other stress factors. Objectives: The aim of this experiment was, therefore, to test the isolated effect of cortisol on flow-experience, independent of concomitant physiological and psychological stress responses, via controlled administration of exogenous cortisol. Methods: Sixty-four young healthy subjects (32 males, 32 females) participated in the experiment. According to a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over design, they received 20 mg oral cortisol on 1 day and placebo on the other day, respectively, with a time distance of 1 week between the experimental days. One hour after cortisol administration, participants engaged in the computer game Pacman. Pacman was delivered in five blocks of randomly differing difficulty levels. One block lasted 5 min. At the end of each block, participants rated flow-experience by the Flow Short Scale. Data was analyzed with hierarchical linear modeling. Subjects were not able to predict whether the pill they received contained cortisol or placebo. Results: Overall, results revealed a negative effect of oral 20 mg cortisol on flow-experience, with no differences between males and females. Conclusions: This study is the first to show that exogenous cortisol in a dose corresponding to a severe stressor impairs flow-experience. The observed negative effect of high cortisol dosage on experienced flow underlines recent findings of an inverted u-shaped relationship between cortisol and flow. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",doi,10.1007/s00213-014-3753-5,Scopus,Psychopharmacology,"Peifer C., Schächinger H., Engeser S., Antoni C.H.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,"Critical Decision-Speed And Information Transfer In The ""Graz Brain-Computer Interface""","The ""Graz Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) "" transforms changes in oscillatory EEG activity into control signals for external devices and feedback. These changes are induced by various motor imageries performed by the user. For this study, 2 different types of motor imagery (movement of the right vs. left hand or both feet) were classified by processing 2 bipolar EEG-channels (derived at electrode positions C3 and C4). After a few sessions, within some weeks, 4 young paraplegic patients learned to control the BCI. In accordance with the participants, decision-speed (trial length) was varied and the information transfer rate (ITR) was calculated for each run. All experimental runs have been feedback-runs employing a simple computer-game-like paradigm. A falling ball had to be led into a randomly marked target halfway down the screen. The horizontal position was controlled by the BCI-output signal and the trial length was varied by the investigator across runs. The goal was to find values for trial length enabling a maximum ITR. Three out of 4 participants had good results after a few runs. Analysis of their last 2 experimental sessions, each containing between 10 and 16 runs, showed that the trial length can be reduced to values around 2 s to obtain the highest possible information transfer. Attainable ITRs were between 5 and 17 bit/min depending on the participant's performance and condition.",doi,10.1023/A:1024637331493,Scopus,Applied Psychophysiology Biofeedback,"Krausz G., Scherer R., Korisek G., Pfurtscheller G.",2003,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Damage To Insula Abolishes Cognitive Distortions During Simulated Gambling,"Gambling is a naturalistic example of risky decision-making. During gambling, players typically display an array of cognitive biases that create a distorted expectancy of winning. This study investigated brain regions underpinning gambling-related cognitive distortions, contrasting patients with focal brain lesions to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), insula, or amygdala (""target patients"") against healthy comparison participants and lesion comparison patients (i.e., with lesions that spare the target regions). A slot machine task was used to deliver near-miss outcomes (i.e., nonwins that fall spatially close to a jackpot), and a roulette game was used to examine the gambler's fallacy (color decisions following outcome runs). Comparison groups displayed a heightened motivation to play following near misses (compared with full misses), and manifested a classic gambler's fallacy effect. Both effects were also observed in patients with vmPFC and amygdala damage, but were absent in patients with insula damage. Our findings indicate that the distorted cognitive processing of near-miss outcomes and event sequences may be ordinarily supported by the recruitment of the insula. Interventions to reduce insula reactivity could show promise in the treatment of disordered gambling.",doi,10.1073/pnas.1322295111,Scopus,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,"Clark L., Studer B., Bruss J., Tranel D., Bechara A.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Desensitization To Portrayals Of Real-Life Aggression As A Function Of Television Violence,"Tested in 2 separate experiments, the hypothesis that exposure to violence in the context of TV drama decreases Ss' emotional responsivity to portrayals of real-life aggression. Ss were shown either an excerpt from a violent police drama or a segment of an exciting but nonviolent volley-ball game before watching a videotaped scene of real aggression. Emotionality was measured by changes in skin resistance which was measured continuously throughout the session. In Exp I, Ss were 28 8-10 yr olds, and the real aggression was a film of an argument and fight between 2 preschoolers. In Exp II, 59 college students participated, and reactions to real aggression were measured while Ss watched scenes from news films of the riots at the 1968 Democratic National Convention. With the exception of adult females, Ss who previously had viewed the aggression drama were less aroused by the scenes of real aggression than were Ss who had seen the control film. The hypothesis is further supported by the finding that for most groups of Ss, the amount of TV violence normally viewed was negatively related to responsivity while viewing aggression.

,Design And Implementation Of An Autonomous Robot Soccer System,"A design and implementation method of a robot soccer system with three vision-based autonomous robots is proposed in this paper. A hierarchical architecture with four independent layers: (a) information layer, (b) strategy layer, (c) tactics layer, and (d) execution layer, is proposed to construct a flexible and robust vision-based autonomous robot soccer system efficiently. Five mechanisms, including (a) a two-dimensional neck mechanism, (b) dribbling mechanism, (c) shooting mechanism, (d) aiming mechanism, and (e) flexible movement mechanism, are proposed to mean the robot with multiple functions can win the game. A method based on data obtained from a compass and a vision sensor is proposed to determine the location of the robot on the field. In the strategy design, a hierarchical architecture of decision based on the finite-state transition mechanism for the field players and the goalkeeper is proposed to solve varied situations in the robot soccer game. Three vision-based robots are implemented and some real competition results in the FIRA Cup are presented to illustrate the validity and feasibility of the proposed method in autonomous robot soccer system design. © 2013 Cheng et al.",doi,10.5772/56189,Scopus,International Journal of Advanced Robotic Systems,"Wong C.-C., Cheng C.-T., Chan H.-M.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Designing Play For Dark Times,"This article reports on a knowledge-exchange network project that had the core aim of informing the development of a video game for hospitalized children. In order to do this, it brought together hospital play specialists, academics and representatives from the digital games industry to co-produce knowledge that could be used in the future production of such a product. The project came about in relation to having identified a lack of research about and actual physical-digital games designed specifically for children living in adverse (‘dark’) times. This is despite the fact that there is a substantial body of research that has shown how play is beneficial for helping children make sense of what is happening to them, and thus results in better mental, emotional and physical well-being. The article describes a selection of the knowledge-exchange presentations and activities that were used throughout the project. Specifically, these activities used art-and-design-based methods as a means of knowing through making. The methods are discussed in relation to how they generated knowledge that responded to the objectives of the project. These were, firstly, to allow children to express emotions about their illness and/or being in hospital; secondly, to offer information on the hospital experience; and, finally, to develop a design that could cross physical and digital platforms with a space for open-ended child-directed play. As the overarching intention of the project was to generate knowledge across the stakeholders, the project ended by materializing the core findings from the project into a paper prototype of a game on which a hypothetical digital-physical version could be based. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",doi,10.1177/1463949117714081,Scopus,Contemporary Issues in Early Childhood,Yamada-Rice D.,2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Designing Serious Game Interventions For Individuals With Autism,"The design of “Serious games” that use game components (e.g., storyline, long-term goals, rewards) to create engaging learning experiences has increased in recent years. We examine of the core principles of serious game design and examine the current use of these principles in computer-based interventions for individuals with autism. Participants who undergo these computer-based interventions often show little evidence of the ability to generalize such learning to novel, everyday social communicative interactions. This lack of generalized learning may result, in part, from the limited use of fundamental elements of serious game design that are known to maximize learning. We suggest that future computer-based interventions should consider the full range of serious game design principles that promote generalization of learning. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",doi,10.1007/s10803-014-2333-1,Scopus,Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders,"Whyte E.M., Smyth J.M., Scherf K.S.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Determining Factors In Choice Of Arcade Games And Their Consequences Upon Young Male Players.,"Two experiments, one conducted with male university students and the other with male high school and junior high school students, investigated (a) determinants of preferences for driving-type games widely available in public game arcades, and (b) the effects of extended play upon mood and motivation to continue playing. Four games were investigated: these were Death Race and Demolition Derby, which simulate violent, antisocial driving behavior; and Night Driver and Le Mans, which simulate skilled prosocial driving behavior. Preference for arcade games simulating aggressive behavior was found to be independent of personality and mood. However, preferences were closely related to the performers' c]apabilities. Players who exhibited higher levels of skill preferred the more skilldemanding games and those who showed less skill preferred aggression games, suggesting the operation of competency motivation in that the players preferred games appropriate to their level of skill. Subjects reported that the games were exciting, but extended play produced discomfort or an increase in negatively toned moods (fatigue, anxiety, and depression) and a decrease in positively toned moods (social affection, surgency, skepticism, concentration and vigor). However, these effects were not found to be a function of the anti- or prosocial content in the specific games studied and may well be effects accompanying activities that are subjectively fatiguing.",doi,10.1111/j.1559-1816.1985.tb02339.x,anderson2010,Journal of Applied Social Psychology,"Nelson, T.

,Development And Validation Of A Smartphone Heart Rate Acquisition Application For Health Promotion And Wellness Telehealth Applications,"Objective. Current generation smartphones' video camera technologies enable photoplethysmographic (PPG) acquisition and heart rate (HR) measurement. The study objective was to develop an Android application and compare HRs derived from a Motorola Droid to electrocardiograph (ECG) and Nonin 9560BT pulse oximeter readings during various movement-free tasks. Materials and Methods. HRs were collected simultaneously from 14 subjects, ages 20 to 58, healthy or with clinical conditions, using the 3 devices during 5-minute periods while at rest, reading aloud under observation, and playing a video game. Correlation between the 3 devices was determined, and Bland-Altman plots for all possible pairs of devices across all conditions assessed agreement. Results. Across conditions, all device pairs showed high correlations. Bland-Altman plots further revealed the Droid as a valid measure for HR acquisition. Across all conditions, the Droid compared to ECG, 95 of the data points (differences between devices) fell within the limits of agreement. Conclusion. The Android application provides valid HRs at varying levels of movement free mental/perceptual motor exertion. Lack of electrode patches or wireless sensor telemetric straps make it advantageous for use in mobile-cell-phone-delivered health promotion and wellness programs. Further validation is needed to determine its applicability while engaging in physical movement-related activities. Copyright © 2012 Mathew J.

,Did The Super Bowl Kill The Internet?,"Given the rapid increase in Internet streaming services to access multimedia content, to the detriment of traditional cable, satellite, and terrestrial, it is to be expected that this traffic will affect the performance of the Internet at several levels. One such level is the communication between autonomous systems that is primarily based on border gateway protocol (BGP). In order to understand this impact, a tool was developed to detect the problems that occur during a specific time period. This tool is able to identify and classify flapping events providing information about the networks potentially involved in the disruptions. The main focus of this paper is the analysis of the BGP updates registered during Super Bowl 2016 in order to understand how a large streaming event affects the Internet at the BGP level. Those results show that an increase in the number of updates happened during key times when a large number of concurrent viewers connected to the game. Many dampening and flapping events were observed accordingly. From those events, networks potentially affected were detected and categorized. The results of our study suggest that the Internet is not prepared to accommodate the potential streaming traffic generated during major events. This is of utmost importance for content providers and content delivery networks in designing their broadcast strategies which should take into consideration not only the scalability of their own servers but also the way in which data reaches the viewer. © 2013 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2703980,Scopus,IEEE Access,"Morales N., Bergstrom M.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Digital Posturography Games Correlate With Gross Motor Function In Children With Cerebral Palsy,"Objective: This pilot study aimed to assess whether performance on posturography games correlates with the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM) in children with cerebral palsy. Materials and Methods: Simple games using static posturography technology allowed subjects to control screen events via postural sway. Game performance was compared with GMFMs using correlation analysis in a convenience sample of nine girls and six boys with cerebral palsy. Likert scales were used to obtain subjective responses to the balance games. Results: GMFM scores correlated with game performance, especially measures emphasizing rhythmic sway. Twelve of the 15 subjects enjoyed the game and asserted an interest in playing again. Conclusions: Digital posturography games engage children with cerebral palsy in balance tasks, provide visual feedback in a balance control task, and have the potential to increase autonomy in balance control training among pediatric patients with cerebral palsy. This approach can support the relationship between child and therapist. The potential for interactive posturography to complement the assessment and treatment of balance in cerebral palsy bears continuing study. © Copyright 2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",doi,10.1089/g4h.2014.0096,Scopus,Games for Health Journal,"Bingham P.M., Calhoun B.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Diminished Pulse Pressure Response To Psychological Stress: Early Precursor Of Essential Hypertension?,"An excessive blood pressure response to mental stress is a widely reported characteristic of young normotensive offspring of hypertensive parents. At odds with these reports are data from a large biracial study showing that high risk adolescent offspring had diminished pulse pressure under mental stress and no evidence of greater blood pressure reactivity. We examined this apparent contradiction in a similar but larger sample of 213 normotensive adolescents, comparing blood pressure and heart rate responses to video game, mirror drawing, mental arithmetic, interview, and physical exercise in high- and low-risk offspring. Results replicated the diminished pulse pressure finding, suggesting it is characteristic of African Americans and is evoked by behavioral tasks that entail skeletal-motor inhibition. Submaximal physical exercise failed to discriminate between offspring groups. Possible biologic correlates of diminished pulse pressure in black adolescents with 'high normal' blood pressure warrant further investigation.",doi,10.1097/00006842-199207000-00006,Scopus,Psychosomatic Medicine,"Ewart C.K., Kolodner K.B.",1992,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas

Games For Health Journal, 2(3), 142–149.","With exergames (as with physical activity in general), more intense and longer-duration game play should accrue more health benefits. Exergames, however, appear to be played for relatively short durations, often at medium or lower intensities. Ostensibly games are played for fun or enjoyment. Enhancing the fun or enjoyment experienced during exergame play should enhance the intensity and duration of physical activity, and thereby the health benefits. Research, reviewed herein, indicates fun and/or enjoyment in games are inherently laden with psychosocial, physiological, and embodiment substrates.

,"Does Competition Really Bring Out The Worst? Testosterone, Social Distance And Inter-Male Competition Shape Parochial Altruism In Human Males","Parochial altruism, defined as increased ingroup favoritism and heightened outgroup hostility, is a widespread feature of human societies that affects altruistic cooperation and punishment behavior, particularly in intergroup conflicts. Humans tend to protect fellow group members and fight against outsiders, even at substantial costs for themselves. Testosterone modulates responses to competition and social threat, but its exact role in the context of parochial altruism remains controversial. Here, we investigated how testosterone influences altruistic punishment tendencies in the presence of an intergroup competition. Fifty male soccer fans played an ultimatum game (UG), in which they faced anonymous proposers that could either be a fan of the same soccer team (ingroup) or were fans of other teams (outgroups) that differed in the degree of social distance and enmity to the ingroup. The UG was played in two contexts with varying degrees of intergroup rivalry. Our data show that unfair offers were rejected more frequently than fair proposals and the frequency of altruistic punishment increased with increasing social distance to the outgroups. Adding an intergroup competition led to a further escalation of outgroup hostility and reduced punishment of unfair ingroup members. High testosterone levels were associated with a relatively increased ingroup favoritism and also a change towards enhanced outgroup hostility in the intergroup competition. High testosterone concentrations further predicted increased proposer generosity in interactions with the ingroup. Altogether, a significant relation between testosterone and parochial altruism could be demonstrated, but only in the presence of an intergroup competition. In human males, testosterone may promote group coherence in the face of external threat, even against the urge to selfishly maximize personal reward. In that way, our observation refutes the view that testosterone generally promotes antisocial behaviors and aggressive responses, but underlines its rather specific role in the fine-tuning of male social cognition. © 2014 Diekhof et al.",doi,10.1371/journal.pone.0098977,Scopus,PLoS ONE,"Diekhof E.K., Wittmer S., Reimers L.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Does Familiarity Affect The Enjoyment Of Touchscreen Games For People With Dementia?,"Introduction Previous research has indicated that people living with dementia are able to use touchscreen technology, which presents an opportunity to deliver meaningful and engaging activities for people to pass the time independently. The challenge is to identify suitable applications from the thousands that are currently available, and familiarity, where an app is a digital version of an existing real world game, may be one solution. Objectives To evaluate the concept of familiarity in gameplay with people living with dementia by comparing a known game with a novel game and measuring whether users are able to play these games independently and whether they enjoy doing so. Methods Thirty older adults living with dementia were recruited from local care services. Each participant was assigned to one of two groups. Group 1 played a familiar game (Solitaire) and Group 2 played a novel game (Bubble Xplode). Each participant played the same game on three separate occasions within one week. Number of gameplay attempts, whether a checkpoint was reached and how much time to reach the checkpoint were measured. A brief post-session interview was conducted to assess the participants’ enjoyment. Results Ninety percent of participants attempted gameplay independently with 17% of participants in the familiar group reaching the checkpoint compared with 93% playing the novel game. Regardless of which game was played or whether the checkpoint was reached, 88% of all participants reported enjoyment of the gaming sessions. Discussion People living with dementia can play touchscreen games independently, but familiarity does not ensure successful gameplay. Enjoyment appears to be independent of progression through a game. The potential of novel and unfamiliar games as meaningful activities that people with dementia can engage with independently should be further explored. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd",doi,10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2016.02.001,Scopus,International Journal of Medical Informatics,"Astell A.J., Joddrell P., Groenewoud H., de Lange J., Goumans M., Cordia A., Schikhof Y.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Does Playing Violent Video Games Induce Aggression. Empirical Evidence Of A Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study.,"This study aims to advance the media effects debate concerning violent video games. Meta-analytic reviews reveal a small but noticeable association between playing violent video games and aggressive reactions. However, evidence for causal associations is still rare. In a novel, event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging study, 13 male research participants were observed playing a latest-generation violent video game. Each participant's game play was recorded and content analyzed on a frame-by-frame basis. Onscreen activities were coded as either ""passive/dead, no interactions""; ""active/safe, no imminent danger/no violent interactions""; ""active/potential danger occurs, violent interactions expected""; ""active/under attack, some violent interactions""; and ""active/fighting and killing, many violent interactions."" Previous studies in neuroscience on aggressive thoughts and behaviors suggested that virtual violence would suppress affective areas of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the amygdala subsequent to activity variations at cognitive areas of the ACC. Comparison of game play activities with and without virtual violence in 11 participants confirmed the hypothesis. The rather large observed effects can be considered as caused by the virtual violence. We discuss the applicability of neuroscience methodology in media effects studies, with a special emphasis on the assumption of virtuality prevalent in video game play.",doi,10.1207/S1532785XMEP0801_4,anderson2010,Media Psychology,"Weber, R., Ritterfeld, U., Mathiak, K.",2006,NA,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Does Size Matter? An Examination Of Problem Gamblers’ Skin Conductance Responses To Large And Small Magnitude Rewards,"Previous research has shown that individuals with substance use disorder equally value small and large magnitude rewards. This has led some researchers to conceptualize the problematic behaviors associated with this disorder as being, at least in part, caused by a deficiency in processing reward stimuli. Considering the documented similarities between substance use disorder and disordered gambling, the current study sought to investigate whether problem gamblers also display such an aberrant pattern of incentive processing. Skin conductance responses (SCRs) to small and large magnitude wins were recorded from 16 problem gamblers (PGs) and 16 healthy controls (HCs) while they completed a computer-simulated electronic gaming machine task. The results show that, while large wins elicited greater SCRs compared to small wins for the HC group, no difference in SCR amplitude was found following large and small wins in the PG group. These findings suggest that problem gamblers may be less effective at evaluating the value of incentives, and are discussed in terms of relevant theoretical frameworks. © 2017 Society for Psychophysiological Research",doi,10.1111/psyp.12897,Scopus,Psychophysiology,"Lole L., Gonsalvez C.J.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Does The Relationship Between Natriuretic Hormones And Diastolic Function Differ By Race?,"Introduction: Heart failure develops earlier and is more prevalent in blacks than whites because of their higher incidence of hypertension and diabetes and likely subsequent diastolic dysfunction. Natriuretic peptides (NP) prevent cardiac malfunction through pressure, natriuresis action. However, whether race affects the relationships of NP action with cardiac function is unknown. Methods: To assess this, 55 (21 whites and 27 males) normotensive adults underwent a 2-hour protocol of 40 minutes rest, video game stressor and recovery. Mitral inflow and myocardial velocities (tissue Doppler) were recorded every 20 minutes. Blood pressure and heart rate were obtained at 10-minute intervals. Blood samples for pro-atrial NP and pro-brain NP (pro-BNP) were collected every 40 minutes. Results: There were differences in the association between (1) the changes from rest to stress for E/A ratio and double product (whites, r = -0.42; blacks, r = 0. 10; P = 0.034 for difference between correlations); (2) stress E m and pro-atrial NP (whites, r = 0.59; blacks, r = -0.25; P = 0.025); (3) rest E m and BNP (whites, r = 0.83; blacks r = -0.17; P = 000); (4) rest E m/A m and pro-BNP (whites, r = 0.70; blacks, r = -0.42;; P = 0.003); (5) rest E/E m and pro-BNP (whites, r = -0.61; blacks, r = 0.31; P = 0.015) and (6) stress E and pro-BNP (whites, r = 0.56; blacks, r = -0.18; P = 0.043). Conclusion: The higher correlations between levels of NP and diastolic function indices both at rest and stress suggest that NP protective action is more pronounced in whites than in blacks. © 2012 Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins.",doi,10.1097/MAJ.0b013e31823673fd,Scopus,American Journal of the Medical Sciences,"Kapuku G.K., Davis H.C., Thomas P., Januzzi J., Harshfield G.A.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Eeg-Based Brain-Computer Interface For Emotional Involvement In Games Through Music,"The reliability of commercial non-invasive BCI (Brain Computer Interface) devices and the lower cost of these EEG-based systems, determined the increasing interest in their application in different research fields, also thanks to the portability of the equipment. The latter feature makes BCI devices particularly suited for entertainment applications especially due to the possibility to detect the mental state of the users. The relationship between emotions and entertainment is obvious, as the influence of music in human emotional states. While BCI devices represent a challenge in gaming motion control, they have been successfully applied in music production (Dan et al., PloS ONE, 2009) and composition (Hamadicharef et al., CW2010 282-286, 2010). In our previous work (Folgieri et al., Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Applied Human Factors and Ergonomics, San Francisco, USA) we focused on conscious production of music notes with the aim of developing a prototype for applications in entertainment.

,Effect Of Manipulated State Aggression On Pain Tolerance,"Swearing produces a pain lessening (hypoalgesic) effect for many people; an emotional response may be the underlying mechanism. In this paper, the role of manipulated state aggression on pain tolerance and pain perception is assessed. In a repeated-measures design, pain outcomes were assessed in participants asked to play for 10 minutes a first-person shooter video game vs a golf video game. Sex differences were explored. After playing the first-person shooter video game, aggressive cognitions, aggressive affect, heart rate, and cold pressor latency were increased, and pain perception was decreased. These data indicate that people become more pain tolerant with raised state aggression and support our theory that raised pain tolerance from swearing occurs via an emotional response. © Psychological Reports 2012.",doi,10.2466/16.02.20.PR0.111.4.311-321,Scopus,Psychological Reports,"Stephens R., Allsop C.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,"Effect Of Psychological Stress On The Salivary Cortisol And Amylase Levels In Healthy Young Adults. Archives Of Oral Biology, 49(12), 963–968.","OBJECTIVE: Saliva sampling has the advantage that it is non-invasive, making multiple sampling easy and stress free. We examined the effects of psychological stressor and soother on the salivary cortisol and amylase levels in young adults, and compared the characteristics of these parameters. DESIGN: The subjects completed the trait version of State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) to assess the predisposition to personal anxiety. The video of corneal transplant surgery was served as the stressor for 15 min. A scenic beauty video viewing was also used as the soother. Unstimulated whole saliva was collected every 3 min throughout the session. RESULTS: The amylase level was significantly increased just after the beginning of the stressful video viewing, and immediately returned to the pre-stress level just after the end of the video viewing. The cortisol level was also increased, but to a lesser extent compared with that of amylase. The latency time to the peak level for cortisol was longer than that of amylase. The carry-over effect was not observed in the amylase response but was in cortisol. Although the correlation between the amylase level and the STAI score was highly significant, cortisol level did not. In addition, soothing video viewing significantly decreased the amylase level, but did not affect the cortisol level. CONCLUSION: Salivary amylase level was more significantly increased and reacted more rapidly than cortisol by psychological stressor, suggesting that it is a better index of stress. Furthermore, it is suggested that the enzyme is a soothing or relaxation index.",doi,10.1016/j.archoralbio.2004.06.007,nagy2015,Archives of Oral Biology,"Takai, N., Yamaguchi, M., Aragaki, T., Eto, K., Uchihashi, K., Nishikawa, Y.",2004,NA,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Effectiveness Of A Home-Based Active Video Game Programme In Young Cystic Fibrosis Patients.,"Exercise-based rehabilitation is already a part of cystic fibrosis (CF) treatment; however, patient adherence is low. To assess the effectiveness of a home exercise programme using active video games (AVGs) as a training modality for children and adolescents with CF. Thirty-nine children with CF were randomised to a control group (CG, n = 20, age 11 ± 6 years; FEV1 86.2 ± 20.5% of predicted) or a training group (AVGG, n = 19, age 13 ± 3 years; FEV1 82.7 ± 21.7% of predicted). The home training protocol consisted of 30- to 60-min sessions, 5 days/week, for 6 weeks using a Nintendo Wii™ platform. Exercise capacity was measured by the 6-min walk test (6MWT) and modified shuttle walk test (MSWT); muscular strength was estimated using the horizontal jump test (HJT), medicine ball throw (MBT), and hand grip strength (right [RHG]; left [LHG]); and quality of life was rated using the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R). All the children were measured at baseline, after rehabilitation, and at 12 months. For the group × time interaction ANOVAs, the AVGG showed significant between-group differences in exercise capacity: 6MWT farthest walking distance, 38.4 m (p < 0.01); MSWT farthest walking distance, 78.4 m (p < 0.05); and muscular strength: HJT 9.8 cm, MBT 30.8 cm, RHG 7 kg, and LHG 6.5 kg (p < 0.01), before versus after intervention. The CFQ-R reported significantly higher scores on respiratory symptoms after the intervention and favoured the AVGG, and there was an improvement in other domains after 12 months. Adherence to the home exercise programme was 95% during the 6- week intervention period. A home-based programme using AVGs can effectively improve exercise capacity, muscular strength and quality of life in the short-term in children and adolescents with CF.

We used two different games that contained a battled, excited game (S) and a relieved, mild game (M). The results obtained were as follows: 1) HR in S during game tended to be higher than tnat in M. An index of sympathetic nervous system (SNS) during game was higher than during recovery in S, but showed an opposite change in M. Therefore, S might induce stress response during game while M might do it after game. 2) HR during individual mode in S tended to be higher than during mode in playing against other player. 3) HR, SNS and an index of parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) at 10th min. after game were similar to rest-level in both games. 4) There was positive, significant correlation between level of game master and PNS (y=0.09lx+4.lll, r=0.765, p<0.05). The results suggested that the responses in the autonomic nervous system in children during game were influenced by the type of game and the level of master. © 1995, The Japanese Association of Educational Psychology.

,Effects Of Conversational Involvement Cues On Understanding And Emotions In Instant Messaging Conversations,"In today’s multitasking workplace, conversations are often carried out amid other tasks. This article explores how multitasking affects people’s levels of involvement or engagement in their conversations, and how levels of involvement in turn influence people’s language, understanding, and affective responses to the conversation. We manipulated participants’ levels of involvement in instant messaging conversations using a distraction task (an online game). We found that the distraction task lowered communication involvement. In addition, higher levels of involvement (both of the participant and of the partner) had a positive effect on understanding, emotions, and satisfaction. Moreover, a partner’s verbal cues of involvement, such as assent words and definite articles, influenced participants’ communication outcomes. We conclude by suggesting design features that might allow people to maintain appropriate levels of involvement during instant messaging conversations. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.",doi,10.1177/0261927X15571538,Scopus,Journal of Language and Social Psychology,"Nguyen D.T., Fussell S.R.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Effects Of Exergaming On Physical Activity In Overweight Individuals.,"The majority of patients with overweight and type 2 diabetes show insufficient levels of daily physical activity (PA) and usually are among the least likely to engage in or adhere to any form of generic PA. Active video games (exergames) may be a solution to motivate these individuals to overcome their sedentary lifestyle. This systematic review was conducted to review the current evidence for the effectiveness of exergaming in overweight and type 2 diabetes mellitus and thus to evaluate the suitability of these games to be used as tools for exercise promotion that meet current PA guidelines. We searched electronic bibliographic databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, OpenGrey, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) up to March 2015. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) and cross-sectional studies published in English in a peer-reviewed journal and analyzing the effects of exergames on objectively measured intensity parameters of PA in overweight (body mass index [BMI] ≥25 kg/m(2)) adults (mean age ≥18 years) with and without type 2 diabetes were included. Study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment were performed independently by two review authors. Primary outcomes included changes in oxygen uptake (VO2), energy expenditure (EE), heart rate (HR), or activity counts. Secondary outcomes were enjoyment of treatment, exercise adherence, ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), changes in body composition, and changes in blood parameters (serum glucose, long-term blood glucose, blood cholesterol, triglycerides, or serum lactate). Of 2845 records, 14 publications (11 studies) met the inclusion criteria. All included studies (ten experimental, cross-sectional laboratory studies and one RCT) were able to show increases in either VO2, EE, HR, or activity counts. However, effects of exergaming in terms of changes in these intensity parameters varied significantly between game modes and consoles as well as because of the vastly differing durations of exergame activity between studies. One of the included studies had a low risk of bias, and three had a high risk of bias; seven studies had an unclear risk of bias as the study description was insufficient. No studies were found investigating the changes in objectively measured PA intensity parameters in patients with type 2 diabetes. This review suggests that exergames are able to increase PA among overweight individuals. However, the inconsistent results and the overall poor or moderate methodological quality do not permit judgment on whether exergames are suitable to meet PA guidelines in this target group. The lack of research regarding the effects of exergames in type 2 diabetes indicates a great need for future research.",doi,10.1007/s40279-015-0455-z,pubmed,"Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)","Höchsmann, Christoph; Schüpbach, Michael; Schmidt-Trucksäss, Arno",2017,NA,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Effects Of High Aerobic Intensity Training In Patients With Schizophrenia - A Controlled Trial,"Background: Patients with schizophrenia have a high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). High aerobic intensity training (HIT) improve peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak), net mechanical efficiency of walking and risk factors for CVD but has not been investigated in patients with schizophrenia. Aims: To investigate effects from HIT on VO2peak, net mechanical efficiency of walking and risk factors for CVD in patients with schizophrenia. Methods: 25 inpatients (F2029, ICD-10) were allocated to either HIT or playing computer games (CG), 3 days per week for 8 weeks. HIT consisted of 4 × - 4-min intervals with 3-min break periods, at 8595% and 70% of peak heart rate, respectively. Results: 12 and seven patients completed HIT and CG, respectively. The baseline VO2peak in both groups combined (n = 19) was 36.8 ± 8.2 ml/kg/min and 3.12 ± 0.55 l/min. The HIT group improved VO2peak by 12% from 3.17 ± 0.59 to 3.56 ± 0.68 l/min (P < 0.001), more than the CG group (P = 0.014). Net mechanical efficiency of walking improved by 12% in the HIT group from 19.8 ± 3.0% to 22.2 ± 4.5% (P = 0.005), more than the CG group (P = 0.031). The psychiatric symptoms, expressed as the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS), did not improve in either group. Conclusions: VO2peak and net mechanical efficiency of walking improved significantly by 8 weeks of HIT. HIT should be included in rehabilitation in order to improve physical capacity and contribute risk reduction of CVD. © 2011 Informa Healthcare.",doi,10.3109/08039488.2011.560278,Scopus,Nordic Journal of Psychiatry,"Heggelund J., Nilsberg G.E., Hoff J., Morken G., Helgerud J.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Effects Of Nos3 Glu298asp Polymorphism On Hemodynamic Reactivity To Stress: Influences Of Ethnicity And Obesity,"Studies on the associations between the nitric oxide synthase gene (NOS3) Glu298Asp polymorphism and hypertension status or blood pressure (BP) levels have had inconsistent results. Potential moderating influences of ethnicity, sex, and obesity on the effects of the NOS3 polymorphism have not been examined. We evaluated the influence of these factors on associations between the NOS3 polymorphism, nitric oxide metabolites (NOx), and hemodynamics at rest and during stress. Subjects were 235 African American (AA) and 262 European American (EA) young adults (18.5±2.6 years). Hemodynamic measurements and blood samples for NOx assays were taken before and after a competitive video game challenge. Glu298Asp polymorphism was detected by polymerase chain reaction-restriction enzyme digestion assay. A regression model was built using genotypes, ethnicity, sex, and obesity (body mass index >85th percentile) and their interactions controlling for age; 20.1% of AAs and 49.8% of EAs were carriers of the Asp allele. AAs, regardless of obesity status, exhibited high diastolic blood pressure (DBP) reactivity unless they were nonobese and noncarriers of the Asp allele. EAs exhibited lower DBP reactivity unless they were obese Asp allele carriers. AA nonobese carriers exhibited the greatest total peripheral resistance reactivity. Obese Asp allele carriers exhibited the greatest increases in cardiac output and the greatest decrease in NOx to the stressor. Results indicate the importance of examining impact of BP control-related genetic polymorphisms within the context of moderating factors such as adiposity and ethnicity.",doi,10.1161/01.HYP.0000147578.84729.ac,Scopus,Hypertension,"Malhotra S., Poole J., Davis H., Dong Y., Pollock J., Snieder H., Treiber F.",2004,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,"Effects Of Playing A Computer Game Using A Bright Display On Presleep Physiological Variables, Sleep Latency, Slow Wave Sleep And Rem Sleep","Epidemiological studies have shown that playing a computer game at night delays bedtime and shortens sleeping hours, but the effects on sleep architecture and quality have remained unclear. In the present study, the effects of playing a computer game and using a bright display on nocturnal sleep were examined in a laboratory. Seven male adults (24.7 ± 5.6 years old) played exciting computer games with a bright display (game-BD) and a dark display (game-DD) and performed simple tasks with low mental load as a control condition in front of a BD (control-BD) and DD (control-DD) between 23:00 and 1:45 hours in randomized order and then went to bed at 2:00 hours and slept until 8:00 hours. Rectal temperature, electroencephalogram (EEG), heart rate and subjective sleepiness were recorded before sleep and a polysomnogram was recorded during sleep. Heart rate was significantly higher after playing games than after the control conditions, and it was also significantly higher after using the BD than after using the DD. Subjective sleepiness and relative theta power of EEG were significantly lower after playing games than after the control conditions. Sleep latency was significantly longer after playing games than after the control conditions. REM sleep was significantly shorter after the playing games than after the control conditions. No significant effects of either computer games or BD were found on slow-wave sleep. These results suggest that playing an exciting computer game affects sleep latency and REM sleep but that a bright display does not affect sleep variables. © 2005 European Sleep Research Society.",doi,10.1111/j.1365-2869.2005.00463.x,Scopus,Journal of Sleep Research,"Higuchi S., Motohashi Y., Liu Y., Maeda A.",2005,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Effects Of Playing Violent Computer Games On Emotional Desensitization And Aggressive Behavior,"This study analyzed the effects of playing a violent computer game on emotional desensitization and aggressive behavior. College students (N=58) were randomly assigned to play a violent game (VG) or a nonviolent game (NVG), and then were exposed to a set of emotional pictures. Participants' physiological responses were recorded, and the Self-Assessment Manikin scale was used to assess affective valence and arousal while viewing the pictures. Participants were then asked to replay the game, after which aggressive behavior was measured. Participants' violent game habits (VGH) were also measured. We found that VG playing interacted with participants' VGH to influence aggression, and that self-reported valence mediated this effect by lowering the feelings of pleasure and displeasure toward emotional stimuli. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc..",doi,10.1111/j.1559-1816.2011.00791.x,Scopus,Journal of Applied Social Psychology,"Arriaga P., Monteiro M.B., Esteves F.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Effects Of Sound And Colour On Responses To A Computer Game,"Background colour (red/blue) and sound (loud/quiet) were manipulated in a series of computer games. Players using a blue screen improved gradually over the session, while red screen players peaked midway and then deteriorated. A similar pattern for heart rate was found, suggesting that arousal was implicated in the effect. Sound alone had little impact, but the red/loud combination was associated with perceptions of excitement and playing well.

,Efficacy Of Wii-Fit On Static And Dynamic Balance In Community Dwelling Older Veterans: A Randomized Controlled Pilot Trial,"Background/Objectives. Balance problems are well-established modifiable risk factors for falls, which are common in older adults. The objective of this study was to establish the efficacy of a Wii-Fit interactive video-game-led physical exercise program to improve balance in older Veterans. Methods. A prospective randomized controlled parallel-group trial was conducted at Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Thirty community dwelling Veterans aged 68 (±6.7) years were randomized to either the exercise or control groups. The exercise group performed Wii-Fit program while the control group performed a computer-based cognitive program for 45 minutes, three days per week for 8-weeks. The primary (Berg Balance Scale (BBS)) and secondary outcomes (fear of falling, physical activity enjoyment, and quality of life) were measured at baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks. Results. Of 30 randomized subjects, 27 completed all aspects of the study protocol. There were no study-related adverse events. Intent-to-treat analysis showed a significantly greater improvement in BBS in the exercise group (6.0; 95% CI, 5.1-6.9) compared to the control group (0.5; 95% CI, -0.3-1.3) at 8 weeks (average intergroup difference (95% CI), 5.5 (4.3-6.7), p < 0.001) after adjusting for baseline. Conclusion. This study establishes that the Wii-Fit exercise program is efficacious in improving balance in community dwelling older Veterans.

,Elicited Awe Decreases Aggression,"Awe is a feeling of wonder and amazement in response to experiencing something so vast that it transcends one's current frames of reference. Across three experiments (N = 557), we tested the inhibition effect of awe on aggression. We used a narrative recall task paradigm (Studies 1 and 2) and a video (Study 3) to induce the emotion of awe. After inducing awe, we first examined participants' emotion and their sense of 'small self', and then the manifestation of aggressiveness in a Shooting Game (Study 1), Tangram Help/Hurt Task (Studies 2 and 3) and Aggression-IAT (Study 3), respectively. Results indicated that awe reduced aggression and increased prosociality and a sense of small self relative to neutral affect and positive emotions of happiness and amusement. Mediation analyses evidenced mixed support for a sense of small self mediating the effect of awe on aggression and prosociality. © Copyright 2016 The Author(s).",doi,10.1017/prp.2016.8,Scopus,Journal of Pacific Rim Psychology,"Yang Y., Yang Z., Bao T., Liu Y., Passmore H.-A.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Elite Female Soccer Players Perform More High-Intensity Running When Playing In International Games Compared With Domestic League Games,"The purpose of this study was to compare movement pattern, fatigue development, and heart rate (HR) for top-class elite female players when playing international (INT) vs. domestic league games (DOM). Video-based time-motion analyses and HR recordings were performed on 17 players during INT and DOM. The distances covered in high-intensity running (HIR) and sprinting were longer (p < 0.05) in INT compared with DOM. More (p < 0.05) HIR was covered in INT than DOM during first and second half. Additionally, more (p < 0.05) sprinting occurred in INT compared with DOM in the first half. In both game types, the amount of HIR was reduced by 24-27% (p < 0.05) in the last 15-minute period compared with the first four 15-minute periods of the game. The midfielders covered longer (p < 0.05) distances with HIR in INT than in DOM over the entire game and in the most intense 5-minute period of the games, whereas no differences were observed between the game types for defenders. No difference in the HR response was found between INT and DOM. In conclusion, more HIR and sprinting occur in international compared with domestic games, which may affect the fatigue development for players in physically demanding roles. Thus, our results are important to coaches to prepare players to meet the challenges of international soccer games and show that the ability to perform intense intermittent exercise should be trained regularly in elite female players. © 2010 National Strength and Conditioning Association.",doi,10.1519/JSC.0b013e3181d09f21,Scopus,Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research,"Andersson H.Å., Randers M.B., Heiner-Møller A., Krustrup P., Mohr M.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Emergence Of Trend Trading And Its Effects In Minority Game,"In this paper, we extended Minority Game (MG) by equipping agents with both value and trend strategies. In the new model, agents (we call them strong-adaptation agents) can autonomically select to act as trend trader or value trader when they game and learn in system. So the new model not only can reproduce stylized factors but also has the potential to investigate into the process of some problems of securities market. We investigated the dynamics of trend trading and its impacts on securities market based on the new model. Our research found that trend trading is inevitable when strong-adaptation agents make decisions by inductive reasoning. Trend trading (of strong-adaptation agents) is not irrational behavior but shows agent's strong-adaptation intelligence, because strong-adaptation agents can take advantage of the pure value agents when they game together in hybrid system. We also found that strong-adaptation agents do better in real environment. The results of our research are different with those of behavior finance researches. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

,Emg-Based Analysis Of Change In Muscle Activity During Simulated Driving,"Extensive usage of computers could cause fatigue and even lead to musculo-skeletal injuries. Onset of fatigue can be determined by analyzing biosignals like surface electromyogram (sEMG), electrocardiogram (ECG), electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrooculogram (EOG). Physiological parameters such as pressure, respiration rate and oxygen debt have also been used to estimate the onset of fatigue and recovery time. Other than these measures, behavioral analysis using video and subjective analysis have also been used extensively to detect onset of fatigue. In this study, muscle activity changes in the shoulder and neck muscles while gaming in an automobile simulator, using sEMG, are analyzed. Two groups of professional and non-professional drivers participated in this study. Statistically significant (p<0.05) change in muscle activity is found in both the groups during a short duration (15 min) of gaming. Such analysis can be used to identify weak muscles in subjects, which can be used as an input for necessary rehabilitation or training programs. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

,Emotion Regulation And Its Effects On Mood Improvement In Response To An In Vivo Peer Rejection Challenge,"This study examined children's spontaneous use of behavioral emotion regulation (ER) strategies and their effects on subsequent mood change in response to an in vivo peer rejection manipulation. Participants (N = 186), ranging between 10 and 13 years of age, played a computer game based on the television show Survivor and were randomized to either peer rejection (being voted out of the game) or nonrejection control. In response to rejection, more than one third of the participants (38%) displayed a marked worsening (i.e., reliable change) in state mood. After receiving feedback, time spent on several behavioral ER strategies during a 5-minute postfeedback period was assessed. At the end of the postfeedback period, children's cognitive activity was also assessed. More time spent on behavioral distraction was positively linked to subsequent increases in positive affect, whereas the reverse pattern was found for disengagement/passive behavior. Moreover, higher endorsement ratings for the strategy of ""cognitive analysis"" were associated with stronger increases in negative affect. © 2006 APA, all rights reserved.",doi,10.1037/1528-3542.6.4.543,Scopus,Emotion,"Reijntjes A., Stegge H., Terwogt M.M., Kamphuis J.H., Telch M.J.",2006,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Emotion Understanding And Performance During Computer-Supported Collaboration,"Individuals collaborating around and through computers benefit from receiving information that helps them understand one another, which is often termed awareness. This article explores what collaborators understand about each other's emotions and the potential benefits for performance that might come from raising this understanding. In Experiment 1 co-located collaborators judged each other's emotions after playing a game that required cooperative data collection and analysis. Their judgements were largely inaccurate and based on their own emotions, suggesting limited emotion understanding. Experiment 2 explored if this could be overcome by making collaborators aware of each other's emotions. Co-located and remote collaborators played a cooperative puzzle-solving game under conditions of awareness or no awareness. Awareness was manipulated by making collaborators share their self-reported emotions during key moments of their game play. Both remote and co-located collaborators improved their performance after sharing their emotions. However, unlike co-located collaborators, remote collaborators also improved their understanding of each other's emotions and experienced more positive affect. We conclude by discussing the content of collaborators' emotion understanding and the probable mechanisms underlying the observed effects of being made aware of a partner's emotions. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

,Emotional Mapping Of The Archaeologist Game,"Mobile and ubiquitous learning has been linked to new information and communication technologies embedded in everyday life objects. A variety of invisible embedded tools have been developed and are connected to the Internet. The boundaries between learning, gaming, simulating or role-playing are not clearly defined. In this context a visit to a museum or to another place of interest (e.g. Archaeological parks, historical towns, urban trekking, etc.) using a smartphone, or a tablet, may offer a unique educational experience as will be described in the didactic experiments of EMMAP (Emotional Mapping of Museum Augmented Places) at the Archaeological Museum ""Giuseppe Moretti"" of San Severino Marche (Italy). EMMAP is a format aimed to develop innovative pedagogies, using handheld technology combined with QR codes, broadcasting and augmented reality (AR). These tools are useful in creating a ubiquitous learning environment and involving participants emotionally in a real landscape. In an authentic context, emotions play a relevant role in engaging students in a rich learning experience. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of the present study was to examine the potential moderating influence of ethnicity, obesity, and socioeconomic status on associations between the ET-1/Lys 198Asn polymorphism and hemodynamic function at rest and during two laboratory stressors (video game, forehead cold) in a sample of 161 black and 213 white American normotensive young adults (mean age, 18.5 ± 2.7 years). Carrier status of the T allele was not associated with resting blood pressure or total peripheral resistance index. However, carriers of the T allele showed greater diastolic blood pressure increases to the video game (P<0.04), particularly among those who were obese (P<0.02). Carrier status also interacted with socioeconomic status such that T allele carriers who came from lower socioeconomic status backgrounds exhibited the greatest increases in systolic blood pressure to the video game challenge (P<0.05).

,Energy-Efficient Power Allocation In Cognitive Sensor Networks: A Coupled Constraint Game Approach,"In this paper, we investigate power allocation in cognitive sensor networks, where cognitive users (cognitive enabled sensor nodes) opportunistically share the common spectrum with primary users (licensed devices). Consider that sensor nodes are self-interested to maximize their own utilities, we formulate the energy-efficient power allocation problem as a non-cooperative coupled constraint game, by taking the interference temperature into account. An energy efficiency-oriented utility function is defined as a new metric to evaluate the performance of power allocation. Firstly, we prove that there exist Nash equilibriums in the proposed game. Then, we prove that the power allocation game is a super-modular game under some conditions. Finally, we design centralized and distributed Game-based Efficiency-oriented Power Allocation algorithms (i.e., centralized GEPA and distributed GEPA) to obtain the Nash equilibriums. Extensive simulations are conducted to demonstrate that the proposed power allocation algorithms can achieve satisfactory performance in terms of energy efficiency, convergence speed and fairness in cognitive sensor networks. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",doi,10.1007/s11276-014-0867-y,Scopus,Wireless Networks,"Chai B., Deng R., Shi Z., Cheng P., Chen J.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Energy Expended Playing Xbox Kinect™ And Wii™ Games: A Preliminary Study Comparing Single And Multiplayer Modes,"Objectives: It has been reported that a higher galvanic skin response is seen when playing video games against another human player than when playing alone, which suggests increased effort. The objectives of this study were to compare energy expenditure when playing two popular active video game consoles, and to compare energy expenditure when playing in single and multiplayer modes. Design: Crossover trial with randomised playing order. Participants: Fourteen healthy adults with a mean age of 21 [standard deviation (SD) 3] years. Methods and interventions: Energy expenditure was measured using an indirect calorimeter at rest, during 10. minutes of play on Xbox Kinect™ Reflex Ridge in both single and multiplayer modes, and during 10. minutes of play on Wii™ Sports Boxing in both single and multiplayer modes. Main outcome measures: Metabolic equivalents (METs), heart rate, oxygen consumption and kilocalories expended. Results: The energy expenditure during all gaming conditions was of a light intensity. Playing on the Xbox Kinect elicited greater energy expenditure than playing on the Wii [mean difference. =0.9 METs, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.2 to 1.5]. Playing games in multiplayer mode led to greater energy expenditure (mean difference. =0.5 METs, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.9) and heart rate (mean difference. =7.9 beats/minute, 95% CI 2.0 to 13.8) than playing in single player mode. Conclusions: No gaming condition required moderate-intensity activity in this group of young healthy adults. Potential explanations for the difference in energy expenditure seen between consoles and modes are discussed. © 2012 Chartered Society of Physiotherapy.",doi,10.1016/j.physio.2012.05.010,Scopus,Physiotherapy (United Kingdom),"O'Donovan C., Hirsch E., Holohan E., McBride I., McManus R., Hussey J.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Engage: Guided Activity-Based Gaming In Neurorehabilitation After Stroke: A Pilot Study,"Introduction. Stroke is a leading cause of disability in healthy adults. The purpose of this pilot study was to assess the feasibility and outcomes of a novel video gaming repetitive practice paradigm, (ENGAGE) enhanced neurorehabilitation: guided activity-based gaming exercise. Methods. Sixteen individuals at least three months after stroke served as participants. All participants received concurrent outpatient therapy or took part in a stroke exercise class and completed at least 500 minutes of gaming. Primary baseline and posttest outcome measures included the Wolf motor function test (WMFT) and the Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA). ENGAGE uses a game selection algorithm providing focused, graded activity-based repetitive practice that is highly individualized and directed. The Wilcoxon signed ranks test was used to determine statistical significance. Results. There were improvements in the WMFT (P=0.003) and the FMA (P=0.002) that exceeded established values of minimal clinically important difference. Conclusions. ENGAGE was feasible and an effective adjunct to concurrent therapy after stroke. © 2012 Ann Reinthal et al.",doi,10.1155/2012/784232,Scopus,Stroke Research and Treatment,"Reinthal A., Szirony K., Clark C., Swiers J., Kellicker M., Linder S.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas

The chapter continues by focusing specifically on a particular case study where emotional attributes were added to a conversational character in Linden Labs' Second Life, after which a pilot experiment was conducted to ascertain the user response. The results from the study show that there is some support to the notion that users do prefer interacting with emotionally responsive characters. © 2012, IGI Global.",doi,10.4018/978-1-60960-762-3.ch002,Scopus,Handbook of Research on Practices and Outcomes in Virtual Worlds and Environments,"Slater S., Burden D.",2011,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Enriching Conflict Resolution Environments With The Provision Of Context Information,"It is a common affair to settle disputes out of courts nowadays, through negotiation, mediation or any other mean. This has also been implemented over telecommunication means under the so-called Online Dispute Resolution methods. However, this new technology-supported approach is impersonal and cold, leaving aside important issues such as the disputants' body language, stress level or emotional response while being based on forms, e-mails or chat rooms. To overcome this shortcoming, in this paper, it is proposed the creation of intelligent environments for conflict resolution that can complement the existing tools with important knowledge about the context of interaction. This will allow decision-makers to take better framed decisions based not only on figures but also on important contextual information, similar to what happens when parties communicate in the physical presence of each other. © 2013 Wiley Publishing Ltd",doi,10.1111/exsy.12049,Scopus,Expert Systems,"Carneiro D., Gomes M., Costa Â., Novais P., Neves J.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas

For this purpose children's heart rate (HR) signals, and their expressed preferences of how much ""fun"" particular game variants are, are obtained from experiments using games implemented on the Playware playground. A comprehensive statistical analysis shows that children's reported entertainment preferences correlate well with specific features of the HR signal. Neuro-evolution techniques combined with feature set selection methods permit the construction of user models that predict reported entertainment preferences given HR features. These models are expressed as artificial neural networks and are demonstrated and evaluated on two Playware games and two control tasks requiring physical activity. The best network is able to correctly match expressed preferences in 64% of cases on previously unseen data (p-value 6 • 10-5). The generality of the methodology, its limitations, its usability as a real-time feedback mechanism for entertainment augmentation and as a validation tool are discussed. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",doi,10.1007/s11257-007-9036-7,Scopus,User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction,"Yannakakis G.N., Hallam J., Lund H.H.",2008,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas

,"Ethnicity, Family History Of Hypertension And Patterns Of Hemodynamic Reactivity In Boys","This study compared blood pressure, heart rate, stroke volume, vascular resistance, and cardiac output responses to a video game challenge and forehead cold stressor in 6- to 15-year-old males who varied in ethnicity and family history of essential hypertension. Controlling for age, significant baseline differences were obtained with black boys exhibiting higher systolic and diastolic pressures than their white cohorts. Positive family history children were found to have higher cardiac outputs and stroke volumes indexed by body surface area during baseline. Controlling for baseline hemodynamic responses and age, positive family history children exhibited greater increases in systemic vascular resistance and systolic and diastolic pressure and greater decreases in heart rate to the cold stressor.

,Evaluation Of A 3D Serious Game For Advanced Life Support Retraining,"Objective: Advanced life support (ALS) knowledge and skills decrease in as little as three months, but only a few ALS providers actually attend retraining courses. We assess the effectiveness of a 3D serious game as a new tool for frequent ALS retraining. Methods: We developed a 3D serious game for scenario-based ALS retraining. The serious game, called EMSAVE, was designed to promote self-correction while playing. We organized a retraining course in which 40 ALS providers played two cardiac arrest scenarios with EMSAVE and took a test with 38 multiple-choice questions before and after playing. We administered the same test again 3 months later to evaluate retention. Participants also rated EMSAVE and the overall retraining experience. Results: After using EMSAVE, the number of correct answers per participant increased by 4.8 (95%CI +3.4, +6.2, p<. 0.001) and all but one participant improved. After 3 months, despite an expected decrease in ALS knowledge and skills (-1.9 correct answers, 95%CI -0.6, -3.3, p<. 0.01), there was a significant retention benefit (+2.9 correct answers per participant, 95%CI +1.5, +4.2, p<. 0.001). Moreover, all but one participant regarded EMSAVE as a valuable tool to refresh ALS knowledge and skills, and 85% of participants were also willing to devote 1. h/month to retrain with the serious game. Conclusions: A 3D serious game for scenario-based retraining proved effective to retrain in ALS and supported retention of acquired knowledge and skills at 3 months. EMSAVE also positively engaged and motivated participants. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2013.05.007,Scopus,International Journal of Medical Informatics,"Buttussi F., Pellis T., Cabas Vidani A., Pausler D., Carchietti E., Chittaro L.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Evaluation Of The Energy Cost Of Playing A Dance Simulation Video Game In Overweight And Non-Overweight Children And Adolescents,"The purpose of this study was to determine if there were any differences in the submaximal energy cost of movement between overweight (OW) and non-overweight (NO) children while playing a dance simulation video game, Dance Dance Revolution (DDR) and to determine if the cardiorespiratory measures obtained while playing the game met the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) recommendations for developing and maintaining cardiorespiratory fitness. Twenty-two children and adolescents (10 OW vs. 12 NO) participated in the study. Cardiorespiratory measurements were taken both during a maximal treadmill walking test and during a 12-minute Dance Dance Revolution protocol. The average absolute V̇O2 (OW: 917.1 ± 257.1 vs. 590.6 ± 147.9 mL·min-1) sustained over the DDR protocol was significantly higher in the OW group compared to the NO group. There was no significant difference in the average energy cost of movement when V̇O 2 was normalized to fat-free mass (OW: 17.7 ± 5.1 vs. NO: 17.3 ± 3.9 mL·kgFFM-1·min-1). Both groups were above the minimal ACSM recommended heart rate intensity for developing and maintaining cardiorespiratory fitness when participating in the DDR protocol (OW: 64.83% ± 7.14 vs. NO: 64.51% ± 7.71), V·O2 reserve, however, did not meet ACSM standards for developing and maintaining cardiorespiratory fitness. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG.",doi,10.1055/s-2005-872964,Scopus,International Journal of Sports Medicine,"Unnithan V.B., Houser W., Fernhall B.",2006,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Exercising Your Brain: A Review Of Human Brain Plasticity And Training-Induced Learning,"Human beings have an amazing capacity to learn new skills and adapt to new environments. However, several obstacles remain to be overcome in designing paradigms to broadly improve quality of life. Arguably, the most notable impediment to this goal is that learning tends to be quite specific to the trained regimen and does not transfer to even qualitatively similar tasks. This severely limits the potential benefits of learning to daily life. This review discusses training regimens that lead to the acquisition of new knowledge and strategies that can be used flexibly across a range of tasks and contexts. Possible characteristics of training regimens are proposed that may be responsible for augmented learning, including the manner in which task difficulty is progressed, the motivational state of the learner, and the type of feedback the training provides. When maximally implemented in rehabilitative paradigms, these characteristics may greatly increase the efficacy of training. © 2008 American Psychological Association.",doi,10.1037/a0014345,Scopus,Psychology and Aging,"Green C.S., Bavelier D.",2008,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Exergaming For Physical Activity In Online Physical Education,"For many the thought of students taking an online course conjures up images of students sitting at a computer desk. Students taking online physical education (OLPE) at home may lack opportunities for competitive or cooperative physical activity that are available to students in a traditional setting. Active video games (exergames) can be played over the internet between students. Exergames allow for a new and possibly effective genre of physical activity that offers OLPE students the opportunity to interact in relevant, engaging, and entertaining physical activity with other students. Secondary student (N=124) heart rates were recorded before exergaming, after playing a non-player character, and after playing another student remotely over the internet. The results show that exergaming between students over the internet can raise student heart rates to moderate levels of physical intensity commensurate with guidelines for Physical Intensity for secondary students. Exergames show promise for physical activity in an OLPE course when played against a non-player character and a remote partner.

,Explicit And Implicit Emotional Expression In Bulimia Nervosa In The Acute State And After Recovery,"Expression of emotional state is considered to be a core facet of an individual's emotional competence. Emotional processing in BN has not been often studied and has not been considered from a broad perspective. This study aimed at examining the implicit and explicit emotional expression in BN patients, in the acute state and after recovery. Sixty-three female participants were included: 22 BN, 22 recovered BN (R-BN), and 19 healthy controls (HC). The clinical cases were drawn from consecutive admissions and diagnosed according to DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria. Self reported (explicit) emotional expression was measured with State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory-2, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and Symptom Check List-90 items-Revised. Emotional facial expression (implicit) was recorded by means of an integrated camera (by detecting Facial Feature Tracking), during a 20 minutes therapeutic video game. In the acute illness explicit emotional expression [anxiety (p<0.001) and anger (p<0.05)] was increased. In the recovered group this was decreased to an intermediate level between the acute illness and healthy controls [anxiety (p<0.001) and anger (p<0.05)]. In the implicit measurement of emotional expression patients with acute BN expressed more joy (p<0.001) and less anger (p<0.001) than both healthy controls and those in the recovered group. These findings suggest that there are differences in the implicit and explicit emotional processing in BN, which is significantly reduced after recovery, suggesting an improvement in emotional regulation. © 2014 Tárrega et al.",doi,10.1371/journal.pone.0101639,Scopus,PLoS ONE,"Tárrega S., Fagundo A.B., Jiménez-Murcia S., Granero R., Giner-Bartolomé C., Forcano L., Sánchez I., Santamaría J.J., Ben-Moussa M., Magnenat-Thalmann N., Konstantas D., Lucas M., Nielsen J., Bults R.G.A., Lam T., Kostoulas T., Fakotakis N., Riesco N., Wolz I., Comín-Colet J., Cardi V., Treasure J., Fernández-Formoso J.A., Menchón J.M., Fernández-Aranda F.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Exploring Persistence In Gaming: The Role Of Self-Determination And Social Identity,"The question of why players of video games persist gaming in the face of what seems to be insufficient reward has not yet been properly answered. This paper approaches the issue by combining two general psychological theories: Self-determination Theory (Deci & Ryan, 2000) and Social Identity Theory (Tajfel & Turner, 1986). A large scale survey (N = 7252) enabled a comparison of three groups which differed in terms of their Gamer Identity Strength (GIS), namely the degree to which players define gaming as part of their social identity. GIS is highest in Hardcore gamers and lower for Heavy and Casual gamers. GIS was positively, and uniformly, related with needs for Competence, Autonomy and Relatedness. Meanwhile, regulation was greater and more internal in the higher GIS groups. Finally, persistence was found to increase with GIS. The structure of needs and regulation modes underlying persistence was comparatively analyzed for the three groups; similarities between GIS groups were more frequent than differences. Most importantly, results indicated that Casual and Heavy gamers were motivated to continue to play as a result of both the feelings of enjoyment and a sense of connectedness. Hardcore gamers were more intrinsically motivated through enjoyment enhancing their levels of persistence accordingly. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

,Exploring Sociality And Engagement In Play Through Game-Control Distribution,"This study explores how distributing the controls of a video game among multiple players affects the sociality and engagement experienced in game play. A video game was developed in which the distribution of game controls among the players could be varied, thereby affecting the abilities of the individual players to control the game. An experiment was set up in which eight groups of three players were asked to play the video game while the distribution of the game controls was increased in three steps. After each playing session, the players' experiences of sociality and engagement were assessed using questionnaires. The results showed that distributing game control among the players increased the level of experienced sociality and reduced the level of experienced control. The game in which the controls were partly distributed led to the highest levels of experienced engagement, because the game allowed social play while still giving the players a sense of autonomy. The implications for interaction design are discussed. © 2009 The Author(s).",doi,10.1007/s00146-009-0245-y,Scopus,AI and Society,"Rozendaal M.C., Braat B.A.L., Wensveen S.A.G.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas

,Fear Of Negative Evaluation Moderates Effects Of Social Exclusion On Selective Attention To Social Signs,"Previous studies demonstrated that fear of negative evaluation (FNE) moderates responses to exclusion in late-stage social outcomes (e.g., social judgements and behaviours). People with low levels of FNE show affiliative responses, feeling compelled to recover their sense of belonging, whereas people with high levels of FNE do not. This study examined whether FNE also moderates responses to exclusion in early-stage interpersonal perception, manifested in selective attention. The experiment using a dot-probe task revealed that exclusion led participants with low levels of FNE to increase attention to signs of social acceptance (i.e., smiling faces). It also revealed that exclusion led those with high levels of FNE to pay more attention to signs of social threat (i.e., angry faces) relative to those of social acceptance. Thus, exclusion makes the motivation to protect oneself from social threats dominant over the motivation to reestablish social bonds among those who fear negative evaluation. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",doi,10.1080/02699931.2014.977848,Scopus,Cognition and Emotion,"Tanaka H., Ikegami T.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Feasibility Of Activity-Promoting Video Games Among Obese Adolescents And Young Adults In A Clinical Setting,"One component of the recent obesity epidemic is the sedentary behaviour of children and adolescents e.g., use of video games consoles. The new generation of video games requires body movements and might thus increase activity. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether such games could have an effect on physical activity in obese adolescents in a clinical setting. Between March and May 2007 activity-promoting video games ("" apvg"" ) were offered to all 84 inpatients (aged 13-28 years) registered in a long-term rehabilitation programme on a voluntary base. Reasons for (non-)attendance were assessed. Frequency and duration of use of the activity-promoting video game sessions were documented. Furthermore, heart rate and activity counts during use of ""apvg"", endurance training, and strength training were measured. Of 84 inpatients, 51 used the ""apvg"" at least once (69%) over the study period. The median weekly use of the intervention was 27. min during the first week (range 0-182. min), declining to zero (range 0-74. min) in week four. Mean heart rate during the sessions (mean 115. bpm; 95% confidence interval 108-122. bpm) was similar to the heart rate during strength training (106. bpm; 101-112. bpm). The results indicate that the video games could have an impact on the activity of obese adolescents and young adults. However, as the interest in the devices seems to be too low the suitability of them for weight reduction programmes in young people cannot be ensured. © 2010 Sports Medicine Australia.",doi,10.1016/j.jsams.2010.07.009,Scopus,Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport,"Radon K., Fürbeck B., Thomas S., Siegfried W., Nowak D., von Kries R.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Fmri-Activation Patterns In The Detection Of Concealed Information Rely On Memory-Related Effects,"Recent research on potential applications of fMRI in the detection of concealed knowledge primarily ascribed the reported differences in hemodynamic response patterns to deception. This interpretation is challenged by the results of the present study. Participants were required to memorize probe and target items (a banknote and a playing card, each). Subsequently, these items were repeatedly presented along with eight irrelevant items in a modified Guilty Knowledge Test design and participants were instructed to simply acknowledge item presentation by pressing one button after each stimulus. Despite the absence of response monitoring demands and thus overt response conflicts, the experiment revealed a differential physiological response pattern as a function of item type. First, probes elicited the largest skin conductance responses. Second, differential hemodynamic responses were observed in bilateral inferior frontal regions, the right supramarginal gyrus and the supplementary motor area as a function of item type. Probes and targets were accompanied by a larger signal increase than irrelevant items in these regions. Moreover, the responses to probes differed substantially from targets. The observed neural response pattern seems to rely on retrieval processes that depend on the depth of processing in the encoding situation. © The Author (2009).

,Fragmentation Transition In A Coevolving Network With Link-State Dynamics,"We study a network model that couples the dynamics of link states with the evolution of the network topology. The state of each link, either A or B, is updated according to the majority rule or zero-temperature Glauber dynamics, in which links adopt the state of the majority of their neighboring links in the network. Additionally, a link that is in a local minority is rewired to a randomly chosen node. While large systems evolving under the majority rule alone always fall into disordered topological traps composed by frustrated links, any amount of rewiring is able to drive the network to complete order, by relinking frustrated links and so releasing the system from traps. However, depending on the relative rate of the majority rule and the rewiring processes, the system evolves towards different ordered absorbing configurations: either a one-component network with all links in the same state or a network fragmented in two components with opposite states. For low rewiring rates and finite-size networks there is a domain of bistability between fragmented and nonfragmented final states. Finite-size scaling indicates that fragmentation is the only possible scenario for large systems and any nonzero rate of rewiring. © 2014 American Physical Society.",doi,10.1103/PhysRevE.89.062802,Scopus,"Physical Review E - Statistical, Nonlinear, and Soft Matter Physics","Carro A., Vazquez F., Toral R., San Miguel M.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas

,Functional Activity Related To Risk Anticipation During Performance Of The Iowa Gambling Task,"Risk anticipation is an important cognitive/emotional component of decision making. The Iowa Gambling Task [Bechara, A., Damasio, A.R., Damasio, H., Anderson, S.W., 1994. Insensitivity to future consequences following damage to human prefrontal cortex. Cognition 50, 7-15], which is the most widely used ""risk-anticipation task"" in clinical studies, has been demonstrated to be sensitive to lesions involving the ventromedial prefrontal cortex or amygdala. However, the critical neural circuitry involved in this complex task has not yet been fully clarified even in healthy subjects. Using a 3-T scanner, we performed an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging study in 14 healthy subjects performing the task. The statistical parametric mapping showed that the risk anticipation component (risky decisions minus safe decisions) exclusively activated the medial frontal gyrus. Furthermore, we found a significant interindividual correlation between the task performance and the magnitude of brain activity during risky decisions. These results indicate that the Iowa Gambling Task does recruit the neural circuitry that is critical in decision making under uncertainty, particularly when subjects perceive the risk of their decision. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

,Futsal Match-Related Fatigue Affects Running Performance And Neuromuscular Parameters But Not Finishing Kick Speed Or Accuracy,"Purpose: The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of futsal match-related fatigue on running performance, neuromuscular variables, and finishing kick speed and accuracy. Methods: Ten professional futsal players participated in the study (age: 22.2 ± 2.5 years) and initially performed an incremental protocol to determine maximum oxygen uptake (V.O2max: 50.6 ± 4.9 mL.kg-1.min-1). Next, simulated games were performed, in four periods of 10 min during which heart rate and blood lactate concentration were monitored. The entire games were video recorded for subsequent automatic tracking. Before and immediately after the simulated game, neuromuscular function was measured by maximal isometric force of knee extension, voluntary activation using twitch interpolation technique, and electromyographic activity. Before, at half time, and immediately after the simulated game, the athletes also performed a set of finishing kicks for ball speed and accuracy measurements. Results: Total distance covered (1st half: 1986.6 ± 74.4 m; 2nd half: 1856.0 ± 129.7 m, P = 0.00) and distance covered per minute (1st half: 103.2 ± 4.4 m.min-1; 2nd half: 96.4 ± 7.5 m.min-1, P = 0.00) demonstrated significant declines during the simulated game, as well as maximal isometric force of knee extension (Before: 840.2 ± 66.2 N; After: 751.6 ± 114.3 N, P = 0.04) and voluntary activation (Before: 85.9 ± 7.5%; After: 74.1 ± 12.3%, P = 0.04), however ball speed and accuracy during the finishing kicks were not significantly affected. Conclusion: Therefore, we conclude that despite the decline in running performance and neuromuscular variables presenting an important manifestation of central fatigue, this condition apparently does not affect the speed and accuracy of finishing kicks. © 2016 Milioni, Vieira, Barbieri, Zagatto, Nordsborg, Barbieri, dos-Santos, Santiago and Papoti.",doi,10.3389/fphys.2016.00518,Scopus,Frontiers in Physiology,"Milioni F., Vieira L.H.P., Barbieri R.A., Zagatto A.M., Nordsborg N.B., Barbieri F.A., dos-Santos J.W., Santiago R.R.P., Papoti M.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas

,"Games, Dreams And Consciousness: Absorption And Perception, Cognition, Emotion","Absorption is central to video game enjoyment and a major component of the development of consciousness. Games are rich sources of perceptual experiences and may facilitate absorption but transpersonal experiences are not guaranteed. Sustained absorption in the game world is tied to the development of player cognitive skills, and to the game world's perceptual environments, interactive functions, and narratives, including challenges and archetypical characters. Games are perceptually detailed, and technology advances are facilitating our entry into narrative universes of virtual fantasy and virtual reality, populated by archetypes, that are limited only by the imagination. Action games make available a rich cognitive, social, and cultural context where players may achieve sustained absorption and access higher levels of consciousness. Parallels between dreams and games, as well as reciprocal processing and behavioral transfers point to games' emotional benefits.

,Gamygdala: An Emotion Engine For Games,"In this paper we present GAMYGDALA, an emotional appraisal engine that enables game developers to easily add emotions to their Non-Player Characters (NPC). Our approach proposes a solution that is positioned between event coding of affect, where individual events have predetermined annotated emotional consequences for NPCs, and a full blown cognitive appraisal model. Instead, for an NPC that needs emotions the game developer defines goals and annotates game events with a relation to these goals. Based on this input, GAMYGDALA produces an emotion for that NPC according to the well-known OCC model. In this paper we provide evidence for the following: GAMYGDALA provides black-box Game-AI independent emotion support, is efficient for large numbers of NPCs, and is psychologically grounded. © 2013 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/T-AFFC.2013.24,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing,"Popescu A., Broekens J., Van Someren M.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas

,"Generating Eustress By Challenging Employees. Helping People Savor Their Work.

Professionals and academics alike have come to realize the importance of workplace conditions to the creation and maintenance of a healthy and happy workforce. One important target of wellness programs has been the management of workplace stress. Specifically, most of these programs are designed to reduce or eliminate unhealthy stress. Though the authors of this article concur that unhealthy workplace stress must be managed, they hold the less widely held view that generating positive stress (eustress) within an organization is another important tool for management professionals. This article emphasizes specific methods that management professionals may employ to create healthy eustress in their organizations. The authors make the argument that workers who are properly challenged can achieve productive and adaptive levels of stress. This article begins by offering the reader a brief background describing eustress. Next, the authors present two separate theoretical models, the Challenge Hindrance Framework and the Holistic Stress Model, which provide unique explanations for the positive benefits of stress. The authors then offer a new managerial model for generating eustress in organizations.

,"Get Angry, Get Out: The Interpersonal Effects Of Anger Communication In Multiparty Negotiation","Research on multiparty negotiation has investigated how parties form coalitions to secure payoffs but has not addressed how emotions may affect such coalition decisions. Extending research on bilateral negotiations which has generally argued that it is beneficial to communicate anger, we argue that it constitutes a considerable risk when there are more than two people present at the negotiation table. Using a computer-mediated coalition game we show that communicating anger is a risky strategy in multiparty bargaining. The main findings of three studies were that participants: (1) form negative impressions of players who communicate anger and therefore (2) exclude such players from coalitions and from obtaining a payoff share, but (3) make considerable concessions on those rare occasions that they choose to form a coalition with an angry player, or (4) when they had to form a coalition with an angry player. We discuss the implications of these results for theorizing on emotions, negotiations, and coalition formation. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Adjusting TXOP can lead to better bandwidth utilization and QoS provisioning. To improve WLAN throughput performance, EDCA packet bursting can be used in 802.11e, meaning that once a station has gained an EDCA-TXOP, it can be allowed to transmit more than one frame without re-contending for the channel. Following the access to the channel, the station can send multiple frames as long as the total access time does not exceed the TXOP Limit. This mechanism can reduce the network overhead and increase the channel utilization instead. However, packet bursting may cause unfairness in addition to increasing jitter, delay and loss. To the best of the authors' knowledge, although TXOP tuning has been investigated through different methods, it has not been considered within a game theory framework. In this study, based on the analytical models of EDCA, a game theoretic approach called GTXOP is proposed to determine TXOP dynamically (i.e. according to the dynamisms of WLAN networks and the number of nodes in the network). Using GTXOP, each node can choose its TXOP autonomously, such that in addition to QoS improvement, the overall network performance is also improved. © 2013 Ghazvini et al.",doi,10.1371/journal.pone.0062925,Scopus,PLoS ONE,"Ghazvini M., Movahedinia N., Jamshidi K.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Health-Related Barriers To Learning Among Graduate Students,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to report the perceived impact of various health concerns on the academic performance of health sciences graduate students. Design/methodology/approach: The American College Health Association's National College Health Assessment (ACHA-NCHA), a 58-item anonymous survey, was distributed to all graduate health science students during a five-week period in the spring semester. Findings: Students (n=1,355) were most likely to report a negative perceived academic impact related to psychosocial concerns such as stress, depression/anxiety, and relationship problems. The students' most pressing felt concerns were upper respiratory infections, stress, concerns about troubled loved ones and sleep difficulties. Clinical graduate students (n=712) were significantly more likely to report negative academic impacts related to upper respiratory infections (p=0.001), concern about a troubled friend or family member (p=0.001), sleep difficulties (p=0.005), relationship difficulties (p=0.030), and internet use/computer games (p=0.015) than non-clinical graduate students. However, the magnitude of those differences was small. Practical implications: This paper adds to one's knowledge of student health concerns, which may help to address health-related barriers to learning. Originality/value: This paper presents findings that further explicate the reciprocal relationship between student health and learning by suggesting methodology to identify priority health issues among a graduate student population. Findings from this study of over 20 different health concerns indicate that the priority health concerns of graduate health science students are primarily psychological and psychosocial health issues. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",doi,10.1108/09654281111161248,Scopus,Health Education,"Kernan W., Bogart J., Wheat M.E.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Health Self-Advocacy Training For Persons With Intellectual Disabilities,"Background: People with intellectual disabilities (ID) have unequal access to health care. While systemic efforts are addressing health inequalities, there remains a need to demonstrate that persons with ID can increase their health self-advocacy skills. Method: A randomised control design with up to 6-month follow-up was used to evaluate the 3Rs (Rights, Respect and Responsibility) health self-advocacy training program for persons with ID (n=31). Training involved teaching participants to recognise and redress health rights violations in the context of respect and responsibility. Training materials included PowerPoint slides and interactive video scenarios illustrating health rights, respect and responsibility problem and non-problems. Two-hour training sessions were conducted twice a week in a group format where participants played a game and answered questions. Results: The health rights training group made significantly more correct responses on post training and follow-up tests than the control group. Training effects generalised to untrained scenarios and in situ health interviews. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that persons with ID can learn complex skills related to health self-advocacy. More research is needed to improve in situ generalisation. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",doi,10.1111/j.1365-2788.2012.01626.x,Scopus,Journal of Intellectual Disability Research,"Feldman M.A., Owen F., Andrews A., Hamelin J., Barber R., Griffiths D.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,"Heart Rate And Liking During ""Kinect Boxing"" Versus ""Wii Boxing"": The Potential For Enjoyable Vigorous Physical Activity Videogames","Objective: Nintendo® (Kyoto, Japan) ""Wii™ Sports Boxing"" (""Wii Boxing"") and Xbox® (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) ""Kinect® Sports Boxing"" (""Kinect Boxing"") are both boxing simulation videogames that are available for two different active videogame (AVG) systems. Although these AVGs are similar, the style of gameplay required is different (i.e., upper body only versus total body movements) and may alter physical activity intensity and one's preference for playing one game over the other. AVGs that elicit the greatest physiologic challenge and are preferred by users should be identified in an effort to enhance the efficacy of physical activity interventions and programs that include AVGs. Materials and Methods: The mean heart rate (HRmean) and peak heart rate (HRpeak) for 27 adults (22.7±4.2 years old) were recorded during four 10-minute conditions: seated rest, treadmill walking at 3 miles/hour, ""Wii Boxing,"" and ""Kinect Boxing."" Upon completion of all four conditions, participants indicated which condition they preferred, and HRmean and HRpeak were calculated as a percentage of age-predicted maximum heart rate to classify physical activity intensity for the three activity conditions (treadmill, ""Wii Boxing,"" and ""Kinect Boxing""). Results: ""Kinect Boxing"" significantly (P&lt;0.001) increased percentage HRmean (64.1±1.6 percent of age-predicted maximum) and percentage HRpeak (76.5±1.9 percent) above all other conditions: Wii HRmean, 53.0±1.2 percent; Wii HRpeak, 61.8±1.5 percent; treadmill HRmean, 52.4±1.2 percent; treadmill HRpeak, 55.2±2.2 percent. Percentage HRpeak for ""Kinect Boxing"" was great enough to be considered a vigorous-intensity physical activity. There was no difference (P=0.55) in percentage HRmean between ""Wii Boxing"" and treadmill walking. Participants also preferred ""Kinect Boxing"" (P&lt;0.001; n=26) to all other conditions (""Wii Boxing,"" n=1; treadmill n=0). Conclusions: ""Kinect Boxing"" was the most preferred and the only condition that was physiologically challenging enough to be classified as a vigorous-intensity physical activity. © Copyright 2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2015.",doi,10.1089/g4h.2014.0068,Scopus,Games for Health Journal,"Sanders G.J., Peacock C.A., Barkley J.E., Gish B., Brock S., Volpenhein J.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Heart Rate Increase To Alcohol Administration And Video Lottery Terminal Play Among Probable Pathological Gamblers And Nonpathological Gamblers,"The authors examined heart-rate responses to alcohol consumption and video lottery terminal (VLT) play. Regular VLT players (30 probable pathological gamblers [PPGs]: 30 nonpathological gamblers [NPGs]) were randomized to an alcohol (mean postdrinking blood alcohol concentration = 0.056%) or placebo condition. Heart rate was recorded at pre- and postdrinking baselines and during VLT play. Consistent with an earlier study (S. H. Stewart, P. Collins, J. R. Blackburn, M. Ellery, & R. Klein, 2005), alcohol-condition participants displayed elevated heart rates relative to placebo-condition participants only at postdrinking and VLT play. Moreover, alcohol-condition participants showed a greater heart rate increase to VLT play than did placebo-condition participants. However, PPGs were not more susceptible to alcohol- and/or VLT play-induced heart rate accelerations than were NPGs. Implications for gambling/ alcohol-disorder comorbidity are discussed.

,Helping Behavior Induced By Empathic Concern Attenuates Anterior Cingulate Activation In Response To Others’ Distress,"Helping behavior is motivated by empathic concern for others in distress. Although empathic concern is pervasive in daily life, its neural mechanisms remain unclear. Empathic concern involves the suppression of the emotional response to others’ distress, which occurs when individuals distance themselves emotionally from the distressed individual. We hypothesized that helping behavior induced by empathic concern, accompanied by perspective-taking, would attenuate the neural activation representing aversive feelings. We also predicted reward system activation due to the positive feeling resulting from helping behavior. Participant underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while playing a virtual ball-toss game. In some blocks (“concern condition”), one player (“isolated player”) did not receive ball-tosses from other players. In this condition, participants increased ball-tosses to the isolated player (helping behavior). Participants then evaluated the improved enjoyment of the isolated player resulting from their helping behavior. Anterior cingulate activation during the concern condition was attenuated by the evaluation of the effect of helping behavior. The right temporoparietal junction, which is involved in perspective-taking and the dorsal striatum, part of the reward system, were also activated during the concern condition. These results suggest that humans can attenuate affective arousal by anticipating the positive outcome of empathic concern through perspective-taking. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",doi,10.1080/17470919.2015.1049709,Scopus,Social Neuroscience,"Kawamichi H., Yoshihara K., Sugawara S.K., Matsunaga M., Makita K., Hamano Y.H., Tanabe H.C., Sadato N.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Hierarchical Relationship Of Negative Emotion Perception From Violent Video Games,"Video games featuring violent contents have become more and more prevalent among children and teenagers. It is therefore imperative to ponder on questions such as ‘Are violent video games dangerous digital games?’ and ‘What negative emotions do they trigger in gamers?’ As such, this study aims to explore the negative emotions that violent video games trigger in gamers and determine the cause for each negative emotion. For the purpose of this research, Resident Evil, a violent video game, has been chosen as the focus. Taking the gamer’s perspective, the study aims to explore and construct a thorough network structure (game triggered event—gamer’s personal belief—feeling of negative emotions) of gamer’s emotions, the structure of gamers’ emotional cluster and the correlation and level of inter-influence between relevant factors. Results of the study reveal that the overall hierarchical value map (HVM) not only presents a comprehensive gamer emotional network structure but also offers a clear illustration of how key game activating events (enemies, stage mission, BOSS level monsters, horror atmosphere, third-person view) lead to the formation of gamers’ personal beliefs of character death, high difficulty, trigger negative emotion, being frightened, enemy ambush and tough enemies, which ultimately lead to negative emotions such as fear, worry, anger, disgust and frustration on gamers’ part. In addition, among the five gamer emotional clusters, the clusters of fear and anger had the heaviest influence on the gamers. The correlation between factors and influence showed different levels of significance. © 2017, © 2017 SAGE Publications.",doi,10.1177/0971721817702281,Scopus,"Science, Technology and Society","Lin H.-W., Luarn P., Lin Y.-L.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,"High And Low Emotion Events Influence Emotional Stress Perceptions And Are Associated With Salivary Cortisol Response Changes In A Consecutive Stress Paradigm. Psychoneuroendocrinology, 27(3), 337–352.","Numerous studies over the last few decades have successfully utilized ""psychological"" stressors to examine stress-induced cortisol release as a function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) cascade. In contrast, research examining the effect emotionally-laden stressors may have on cortisol release is scarce. Moreover, the results from the few studies that have examined subjective perceptions of emotional stress and their relationship to cortisol release are mixed. Thus, little is known about the impact an emotionally-charged stressor may have on cortisol responsivity and even less is understood about the relationship between cortisol release and perceived emotional stress. The primary goal of the present research was to investigate the effect of consecutive, emotionally stressful events on cortisol release. The secondary goal was to examine the influence perceptions about emotionally stressful events might have on cortisol responsivity. This is the first study to identify two distinct patterns of cortisol release that were significantly reversed (P=0.006) in response to high and low emotion events presented in a consecutive stress paradigm that were associated with perceptions of emotional stress.",doi,10.1016/S0306-4530(01)00055-5,nagy2015,Psychoneuroendocrinology,"Nejtek, V.

,Hormonal Responses Differ When Playing Violent Video Games Against An Ingroup And Outgroup,"For 14 teams of three young men, salivary testosterone and cortisol were assessed twice before and twice after competing in within-group and between-group video games that simulated violent male-male competition. Men who contributed the most to their teams' between-group victory showed testosterone increases immediately after the competition, but only if this competition was played before the within-group tournament. High-scoring men on losing teams did not show this immediate effect, but they did show a delayed increase in testosterone. In contrast, high-ranking men tended to have lower testosterone and higher cortisol during within-group tournaments. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that men's competitive testosterone response varies across ingroup and outgroup competitions and is muted during the former. The testosterone response during the between-group competition also suggests that violent multiplayer video games may be appealing to young men because they simulate male-male coalitional competition. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.",doi,10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2009.07.002,Scopus,Evolution and Human Behavior,"Oxford J., Ponzi D., Geary D.C.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Hostile And Hardened? An Experimental Study On (De-)Sensitization To Violence And Suffering Through Playing Video Games,"This study tests whether playing violent video games leads to desensitization and increased cardiovascular responding. In a laboratory experiment, 42 men spent 20 min playing either a high- or low-violence version of a ""first-person shooter"" game. Arousal (heart rate, respiration rate) was measured continuously. After, playing the game, emotional responses to aversive and aggressive stimuli - pictures from Lang, Bradley, and Cuthbert's (1999) International Affective Picture System - were assessed with self-ratings and physiological measurement (skin conductance). Results showed no differences in the judgments of emotional responses to the stimuli. However, different effects of game violence emerged in the physiological reactions to the different types of stimulus material. Participants in the high-violence condition showed significantly weaker reactions (desensitization) to aversive stimuli and reacted significantly more strongly (sensitization) to aggressive cues. No support was found for the arousal hypothesis. Post-hoc analyses are used to discuss possible moderating influences of gaming experience and player's trait aggressiveness in terms of the General Aggression Model (Anderson & Bushman, 2001) and the Downward Spiral Model (Slater, Henry, Swaim, & Anderson, 2003). © 2008 by Verlag Hans Huber.",doi,10.1024/1421-0185.67.1.41,Scopus,Swiss Journal of Psychology,"Staude-Müller F., Bliesener T., Luthman S.",2008,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,How I Became Addicted To Simulations And Games,"Three outstanding teachers stimulated my interest in alternative methods of education and made me receptive to simulations and games. At my first gaming conference, I discovered the value of simulations and games by playing games rather than by listening to lectures. I found the spirit of play and cooperation at NASAGA and ISAGA conferences refreshing and my games owe a considerable debt to the experienced gamers I met there. My experience facilitating games has taught me that allowing a few players to judge the work of their peers using subjective criteria leads to negative emotions, which may cancel any potential benefits of a game. I have also learned that the NEW COMMONS GAME, which illustrates the tragedy of the commons, may leave players feeling helpless and fatalistic about solving real-world commons problems. Several strategies are presented that counter negative feelings and instill optimism in players that commons problems can be solved. Recent developments in the video gaming community provide grounds for optimism about the future of educational gaming. However, it is imperative that video game designers who have an educational goal incorporate the knowledge that educational gamers have acquired over the past 50 years, such as the need for debriefing. A hypothetical, long-term, large-scale game is described that has the potential to educate students campuswide about how a commons resource can be sustained for the benefit of all. In addition, if the game is conducted across semesters or years, players' responsibility to future generations of players could be studied and enhanced. However, the hypothetical game would require revising current thinking about debriefing. A brief description of the games I have designed is included. © 2013 SAGE Publications.",doi,10.1177/1046878113501834,Scopus,Simulation and Gaming,Powers R.B.,2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,"How Impulsiveness, Trait Anger, And Extracurricular Activities Might Affect Aggression In School Children.","Individual differences in personality traits such as impulsivity and trait anger as well as environmental variables have an impact on aggressiveness. We tested a model incorporating the related variables of impulsiveness, trait anger, and aggression and incorporated the possible mediating influences of leisure-time activities. Regression analyses of data from 1129 pre-adolescents and 1093 adolescents (55.4% females) from a study evaluating the Spanish version of the Buss and Perry aggression questionnaire (AQ; Santisteban, Alvarado, & Recio, 2007) showed a relation between impulsiveness (Barratt Impulsiveness Scale) and aggression (AQ). Trait anger (Spielberger’s State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory), the time spent watching TV and playing video games, and the time spent doing homework (all related to impulsiveness) also are related to physical, as well as verbal aggression (with low to moderate coefficients). Multiple mediation analyses confirm that media violence exposure and homework, respectively, can have aggravating and attenuating effects on self-reported aggression. These results provide key variables for longitudinal studies which could reveal the causal nature of the results found with our cross-sectional design.",doi,10.1016/j.paid.2008.07.001,anderson2010,Personality and Individual Differences,"Wittman, M., Arce, E., Santisteban, C.",2008,NA,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Human-Robot Communication For Collaborative Decision Making - A Probabilistic Approach,"Humans and robots need to exchange information if the objective is to achieve a task collaboratively. Two questions are considered in this paper: what and when to communicate. To answer these questions, we developed a human-robot communication framework which makes use of common probabilistic robotics representations. The data stored in the representation determines what to communicate, and probabilistic inference mechanisms determine when to communicate. One application domain of the framework is collaborative human-robot decision making: robots use decision theory to select actions based on perceptual information gathered from their sensors and human operators. In this paper, operators are regarded as remotely located, valuable information sources which need to be managed carefully. Robots decide when to query operators using Value-Of-Information theory, i.e. humans are only queried if the expected benefit of their observation exceeds the cost of obtaining it. This can be seen as a mechanism for adjustable autonomy whereby adjustments are triggered at run-time based on the uncertainty in the robots' beliefs related to their task. This semi-autonomous system is demonstrated using a navigation task and evaluated by a user study. Participants navigated a robot in simulation using the proposed system and via classical teleoperation. Results show that our system has a number of advantages over teleoperation with respect to performance, operator workload, usability, and the users' perception of the robot. We also show that despite these advantages, teleoperation may still be a preferable driving mode depending on the mission priorities.

In addition, two key human performance issues (trust and situation awareness) related to H-A teaming for multirobot control and some promising user interface design solutions to address these issues were discussed.

Next, we review and categorize recent approaches which have been proposed to comply with these requirements. We report a comparison of the most promising methods for multi-view human action recognition using two publicly available datasets: the INRIA Xmas Motion Acquisition Sequences (IXMAS) Multi-View Human Action Dataset, and the i3DPost Multi-View Human Action and Interaction Dataset. To compare the proposed methods, we give a qualitative assessment of methods which cannot be compared quantitatively, and analyze some prominent 3D pose estimation techniques for application, where not only the performed action needs to be identified but a more detailed description of the body pose and joint configuration. Finally, we discuss some of the shortcomings of multi-view camera setups and outline our thoughts on future directions of 3D body pose estimation and human action recognition. © 2012 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/JSTSP.2012.2196975,Scopus,IEEE Journal on Selected Topics in Signal Processing,"Holte M.B., Tran C., Trivedi M.M., Moeslund T.B.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas

,"Impact Of An Active Educational Video Game On Children's Motivation, Science Knowledge, And Physical Activity","Background: Active educational video games (AVGs) appear to have a positive effect on elementary school students' motivation leading to enhanced learning outcomes. The purpose of this study was to identify the effectiveness of an AVG on elementary school students' science knowledge learning, physical activity (PA) level, and interest-based motivation. Methods: In this randomized controlled study, 53 elementary school students were assigned to an experimental condition or a comparison condition. The experimental condition provided an AVG learning environment, whereas the comparison condition was based on sedentary educational video games. Results: The results of repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) on the knowledge test showed that students in both groups performed better on the post-test than they did on the pre-test (p &lt; 0.001, η2 = 0.486), and their post-test scores did not differ significantly. The experimental condition provided a more active environment since the students' average heart rates (HRs) were in the Target-Heart-Rate-Zone (HR = 134 bpm), which was significantly higher than the average HR (103 bpm) from the comparison condition (t = 7.212, p &lt; 0.001). Students in the experimental condition perceived a higher level of situational interest than their counterparts in the comparison group (p &lt; 0.01, and η2 = 0.301). Conclusion: These results suggest that AVGs benefit children more in terms of PA and motivation than traditional video games by providing an enjoyable learning experience and sufficient PA. © 2016.",doi,10.1016/j.jshs.2014.12.004,Scopus,Journal of Sport and Health Science,"Sun H., Gao Y.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Increased Neural Responses To Unfairness In A Loss Context,"Unfairness plays an important role in economic decision making. This fMRI study sought to investigate how the loss and the gain contexts could modulate behavioral and brain responses to unfairness by focusing on participants' rejection behaviors during an Ultimatum Game paradigm. Participants were scanned while they were playing the Ultimatum Game as responders in both loss and gain contexts, i.e. receiving ¥50 as gains and paying for ¥50 as losses. At the behavioral level, lower fairness ratings and higher rejection rates were revealed for unfair losses than unfair gains. At the neural level, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, bilateral anterior insula, anterior cingulate cortex/anterior middle cingulate cortex and bilateral dorsal striatum were associated with rejection (vs. acceptance) in the loss context, but not in the gain context. Together, our data indicated that participants may experience more unfairness in UG and stronger desire to sanction social norm violations in the loss context than in the gain context, inducing more fairness-related neutral activities when rejecting (vs. accepting) unfair losses than unfair gains. These findings shed light on the significance of context (i.e. loss or gain) in fairness-related social decision-making processes. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",doi,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.03.048,Scopus,NeuroImage,"Guo X., Zheng L., Zhu L., Li J., Wang Q., Dienes Z., Yang Z.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Increased Oscillatory Theta Activation Evoked By Violent Digital Game Events,"The authors examined electroencephalographic (EEG) oscillatory responses to two violent events, the player character wounding and killing an opponent character with a gun, in the digital game James Bond 007: NightFire. EEG was recorded from 25 (16 male) right-handed healthy young adults. EEG data were segmented into one 1-s baseline epoch before each event and two 1-s epochs after event onset. Power estimates (μV2) were derived with the fast Fourier transform (FFT) for each artefact free event. Both of the studied events evoked increased occipital theta (4-6 Hz) responses as compared to the pre-event baseline. The wounding event evoked also increased occipital high theta (6-8 Hz) response and the killing event evoked low alpha (8-10 Hz) asymmetry over the central electrodes, both relative to the pre-event baseline. The results are discussed in light of facial electromyographic and electrodermal activity responses evoked by these same events, and it is suggested that the reported EEG responses may be attributable to affective processes related to these violent game events. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

,Influence Of Negative Affect On Choice Behavior In Individuals With Binge Eating Pathology,"Research suggests that individuals with binge eating pathology (e.g., bulimia nervosa (BN) and binge eating disorders (BED)) have decision making impairments and particularly act impulsively in response to negative affect. The aim of this study was to examine the influence of negative affect on choice behavior in women with BN and BED. Ninety women (59 with BN or BED and 31 healthy controls) watched a sad or control film fragment and were subsequently asked to complete a choice behavior task (as measured by a variation of the Bechara Gambling Task (BGT)). Results showed that negative affect influenced choice behavior differently in healthy controls and in women with BN and BED after punishment (but not after reward). In the context of increased negative affect, punishment was associated with more disadvantageous choice behavior in both BN and BED women but not in healthy controls, while the effect was the exact opposite in both groups after a decrease in negative affect. Levels of sadness were not found to influence choice behavior after reward in either groups. These findings suggest that emotional states may have a direct impact on choice behavior of individuals with binge eating pathology and are not only related to pathological behavior itself. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.psychres.2012.10.016,Scopus,Psychiatry Research,"Danner U.N., Evers C., Sternheim L., Van Meer F., Van Elburg A.A., Geerets T.A.M., Breteler L.M.T., T.D. de Ridder D.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Influence Of Violent Video Gaming On Determinants Of The Acquired Capability For Suicide,"The interpersonal theory of suicidal behavior proposes that fearlessness of death and physical pain insensitivity is a necessary requisite for self-inflicted lethal self-harm. Repeated experiences with painful and provocative events are supposed to cause an incremental increase in acquired capability. The present study examined whether playing a first-person shooter-game in contrast to a first-person racing game increases pain tolerance, a dimension of the acquired capability construct, and risk-taking behavior, a risk factor for developing acquired capability. N=81 male participants were randomly assigned to either play an action-shooter or a racing game before engaging in a game on risk-taking behavior and performing a cold pressor task (CPT). Participants exhibited higher pain tolerance after playing an action shooter game than after playing a racing game. Furthermore, playing an action shooter was generally associated with heightened risk-taking behavior. Group-differences were not attributable to the effects of the different types of games on self-reported mood and arousal. Overall these results indicate that action-shooter gaming alters pain tolerance and risk-taking behavior. Therefore, it may well be that long-term consumption of violent video games increases a person's capability to enact lethal self-harm. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.psychres.2013.10.021,Scopus,Psychiatry Research,"Teismann T., Förtsch E.M.A.D., Baumgart P., Het S., Michalak J.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Influencing Human Affective Responses To Dynamic Virtual Environments,"Detecting and measuring emotional responses while interacting with virtual reality (VR), and assessing and interpreting their impacts on human engagement and “immersion,” are both academically and technologically challenging. While many researchers have, in the past, focused on the affective evaluation of passive environments, such as listening to music or the observation of videos and imagery, virtual realities and related interactive environments have been used in only a small number of research studies as a mean of presenting emotional stimuli. This article reports the first stage (focusing on participants’ subjective responses) of a range of experimental investigations supporting the evaluation of emotional responses within a virtual environment, according to a three-dimensional (Valence, Arousal, and Dominance) model of affects, developed in the 1970s and 1980s. To populate this three-dimensional model with participants’ emotional responses, an “affective VR,” capable of manipulating users’ emotions, has been designed and subjectively evaluated. The VR takes the form of a dynamic “speedboat” simulation, elements (controllable VR parameters) of which were assessed and selected based on a 35-respondent online survey, coupled with the implementation of an affective power approximation algorithm. A further 68 participants took part in a series of trials, interacting with a number of VR variations, while subjectively rating their emotional responses. The experimental results provide an early level of confidence that this particular affective VR is capable of manipulating individuals’ emotional experiences, through the control of its internal parameters. Moreover, the approximation technique proved to be fairly reliable in predicting users’ potential emotional responses, in various affective VR settings, prior to actual experiences. Finally, the analysis suggested that the emotional response of the users, with different gender and gaming experiences, could vary, when presented with the same affective VR situation. © 2016 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",doi,10.1162/PRES_a_00249,Scopus,Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments,"Moghimi M., Stone R., Rotshtein P., Cooke N.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Influencing Trust For Human-Automation Collaborative Scheduling Of Multiple Unmanned Vehicles,"Objective: We examined the impact of priming on operator trust and system performance when supervising a decentralized network of heterogeneous unmanned vehicles (UVs). Background: Advances in autonomy have enabled a future vision of single-operator control of multiple heterogeneous UVs. Real-time scheduling for multiple UVs in uncertain environments requires the computational ability of optimization algorithms combined with the judgment and adaptability of human supervisors. Because of system and environmental uncertainty, appropriate operator trust will be instrumental to maintain high system performance and prevent cognitive overload. Method: Three groups of operators experienced different levels of trust priming prior to conducting simulated missions in an existing, multiple-UV simulation environment. Results: Participants who play computer and video games frequently were found to have a higher propensity to overtrust automation. By priming gamers to lower their initial trust to a more appropriate level, system performance was improved by 10% as compared to gamers who were primed to have higher trust in the automation. Conclusion: Priming was successful at adjusting the operator's initial and dynamic trust in the automated scheduling algorithm, which had a substantial impact on system performance. Application: These results have important implications for personnel selection and training for futuristic multi-UV systems under human supervision. Although gamers may bring valuable skills, they may also be potentially prone to automation bias. Priming during training and regular priming throughout missions may be one potential method for overcoming this propensity to overtrust automation. © Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.",doi,10.1177/0018720815587803,Scopus,Human Factors,"Clare A.S., Cummings M.L., Repenning N.P.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Innovative Projects Earning Psychologists Spots On Hospital Health Care Teams,"Innovative hospital projects initiated by psychologists include the use of video games to restore and measure mental functions in seriously injured patients, biofeedback therapy, the use of behavioral techniques to reduce and eliminate pain associated with cancer or with chemotherapy, and the monitoring of high-risk infants. While psychologists have had to fight for hospital privileges, there seems to be a slow movement toward allowing these privileges. Psychologists could also be useful in such areas as stress management, the design of special wheelchairs, and behavior modification for smokers and the obese.

,Is Ffr-Ct A “Game Changer” In The Diagnostic Management Of Stable Coronary Artery Disease? [Ist Die Ct-Ffr-Messung Ein „Game Changer“ In Der Diagnostik Der Koronaren Herzkrankheit?],"The introduction of fractional flow reserve computed tomography (FFR-CT) that is performed from static coronary CT angiography datasets may open new horizons in the diagnostic management of patients with suspected coronary artery disease. FFR-CT has a high sensitivity and moderate specificity in identifying ischemia in intermediate coronary stenoses. It has been demonstrated that this technology has the potential to significantly reduce the number of invasive coronary angiograms and the rate of normal coronary angiograms that are not followed by an intervention. Furthermore, initial data indicate that FFR-CT may predict the hemodynamic effect of stenting and even of bypass surgery. Thus, FFR-CT, with its capacity to serve as an effective gatekeeper before invasive angiography and the option to virtually predict the success of revascularization, constitutes a completely new concept in managing patients with stable angina pectoris. Before this exciting technology can enter clinical practice, however, some evident limitations need to be overcome and significantly more data concerning accuracy and influence on clinical and economic outcome parameters need to be generated. © 2016, Springer Medizin Verlag.",doi,10.1007/s00059-016-4443-3,Scopus,Herz,Leber W.A.,2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Is Playing Exergames Really Exercising? A Meta-Analysis Of Energy Expenditure In Active Video Games,"This article reports a meta-analysis of energy expenditure (EE) of playing active video games (AVGs). In particular, heart rate (HR), oxygen consumption (VO2), and EE were assessed and three moderators for the effects of AVGs-types of AVG, player age, and player weight status-were analyzed. The results show that playing AVGs significantly increased HR, VO2, and EE from resting. The effect sizes of playing AVGs on HR, VO2, and EE were similar to traditional physical activities. AVG type and player age were significant modera-tors for the effects of AVGs. The finding suggests that AVGs are effective technologies that may facilitate light- to moderate-intensity physical activity promotion. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",doi,10.1089/cyber.2010.0578,Scopus,"Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking","Peng W., Lin J.-H., Crouse J.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Is Sensation Seeking A Correlate Of Excessive Behaviors And Behavioral Addictions? A Detailed Examination Of Patients With Gambling Disorder And Internet Addiction,"Sensation Seeking has repeatedly been related to substance use. Also, its role as a correlate of Gambling Disorder has been discussed although research has led to heterogeneous results. Likewise, first studies on Internet Addiction have indicated increased Sensation Seeking, to some extent contradicting clinical impression of patients suffering from internet addiction. We assessed Sensation Seeking in a clinical sample of n=251 patients with Gambling Disorder, n=243 patients with internet addiction, n=103 clients with excessive but not addictive internet use, and n=142 healthy controls. The clinical groups were further sub-divided according to the preferred type of addictive behavior (slot-machine gambling vs. high arousal gambling activities and internet gaming disorder vs. other internet-related addictive behaviors). Decreased scores in some subscales of Sensation Seeking were found among male patients compared to healthy controls with no differences between patients with Gambling Disorder and Internet Addiction. The type of preferred gambling or online activity was not related to differences in Sensation Seeking. Previous findings indicating only small associations between Sensation Seeking and Gambling Disorder were confirmed. Regarding Internet Addiction our results contradict findings from non-clinical samples. Sensation Seeking might be relevant in initiating contact to the health care system. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.psychres.2016.06.004,Scopus,Psychiatry Research,"Müller K.W., Dreier M., Beutel M.E., Wölfling K.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,"Is The Wii Fit™ A New-Generation Tool For Improving Balance, Health And Well-Being? A Pilot Study","BackgroundThe Nintendo Wii Fit™ is a new product that is purported to improve balance, strength, flexibility, fitness and general well-being. Currently, there are no controlled trials published to support such claims. AimThe aim of this research was to determine the feasibility of Wii Fit™ in improving balance, strength, flexibility and fitness for healthy women aged between 30 and 60 years. MethodTen women aged 3058 years were recruited to the study. Intervention involved a 30-min session, twice weekly for 10 weeks. The manufacturer's pre-programmed Wii Fit™ regime determined for age and physical ability was followed. All women were assessed before and after the 10 weeks' intervention. Demographic information collected included age, weight, and self-reported information related to habitual physical activity, regular medication, hormone replacement therapy and well-being. Balance measures included the modified Clinical Test for Sensory Integration of Balance, reaction time and unilateral stance with velocity of sway recorded. Clinical measures of balance and mobility included the Step Test, the timed Up & Go test (TUG) and the TUGcognitive. Somatosensory testing included touch, vibration and knee-joint re-positioning ability; ankle flexibility and the muscle strengths of quadriceps, hip abductors and adductors were also measured. Cardiovascular fitness was measured using a 6-min walk test. ResultsBalance (unilateral stance, eyes open (p<0.05) and lower limb muscle strength (p<0.05) showed significant improvement but changes in touch, vibration, proprioception, cardiovascular endurance, mobility, weight change, activity level and well-being were not significant.

,Kinect System In Home-Based Cardiovascular Rehabilitation,"Cardiovascular diseases lead to a high consumption of financial resources. An important part of the recovery process is the cardiovascular rehabilitation. This study aimed to present a new cardiovascular rehabilitation system to 11 outpatients with coronary artery disease from a Hospital in Porto, Portugal, later collecting their opinions. This system is based on a virtual reality game system, using the Kinect sensor while performing an exercise protocol which is integrated in a home-based cardiovascular rehabilitation programme, with a duration of 6 months and at the maintenance phase. The participants responded to a questionnaire asking for their opinion about the system. The results demonstrated that 91% of the participants (n = 10) enjoyed the artwork, while 100% (n = 11) agreed on the importance and usefulness of the automatic counting of the number of repetitions, moreover 64% (n = 7) reported motivation to continue performing the programme after the end of the study, and 100% (n = 11) recognized Kinect as an instrument with potential to be an asset in cardiovascular rehabilitation. Criticisms included limitations in motion capture and gesture recognition, 91% (n = 10), and the lack of home space, 27% (n = 3). According to the participants' opinions, the Kinect has the potential to be used in cardiovascular rehabilitation; however, several technical details require improvement, particularly regarding the motion capture and gesture recognition. © Institution of Mechanical Engineers.",doi,10.1177/0954411916679201,Scopus,"Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part H: Journal of Engineering in Medicine","Vieira Á., Gabriel J., Melo C., Machado J.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Laif: A Logging And Interaction Framework For Gaze-Based Interfaces In Virtual Entertainment Environments,"Eye tracking is starting to be used for evaluation and interaction in virtual environments. Especially digital games can benefit from an integrated approach, using eye tracking technology for analysis and interaction. One benefit is faster development of gaze interaction games, which can be automatically evaluated in iterative development cycles. For this purpose, we present a framework of programming libraries that enables rapid game development and gameplay analysis within an experimental research environment. The framework presented here is extensible for different kinds of logging (e.g., psychophysiological and in-game behavioral data) and facilitates studies using eye-tracking technology in digital entertainment environments. An experimental study using gaze-only interaction in a digital game is presented and highlights the framework's capacity to create games and evaluate novel entertainment interfaces. © 2010 International Federation for Information Processing.",doi,10.1016/j.entcom.2010.09.004,Scopus,Entertainment Computing,"Nacke L.E., Stellmach S., Sasse D., Niesenhaus J., Dachselt R.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas

,Learning Non-Cooperative Game For Load Balancing Under Self-Interested Distributed Environment,"Resources in large-scale distributed systems are distributed among several autonomous domains. These domains collaborate to produce significantly higher processing capacity through load balancing. However, resources in the same domain tend to be cooperative, whereas those in different domains are self-interested. Fairness is the key to collaboration under a self-interested environment. Accordingly, a fairness-aware load balancing algorithm is proposed. The load balancing problem is defined as a game. The Nash equilibrium solution for this problem minimizes the expected response time, while maintaining fairness. Furthermore, reinforcement learning is used to search for the Nash equilibrium. Compared with static approaches, this algorithm does not require a prior knowledge of job arrival and execution, and can adapt dynamically to these processes. The synthesized tests indicate that our algorithm is close to the optimal scheme in terms of overall expected response time under different system utilization, heterogeneity, and system size; it also ensures fairness similar to the proportional scheme. Trace simulation is conducted using the job workload log of the Scalable POWERpallel2 system in the San Diego Supercomputer Center. Our algorithm increases the expected response time by a maximum of 14%. But it improves fairness by 12–27% in contrast to Opportunistic Load Balancing, Minimum Execution Time, Minimum Completion Time, Switching Algorithm, and k-Percent Best. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",doi,10.1016/j.asoc.2016.10.028,Scopus,Applied Soft Computing Journal,"Xiao Z., Tong Z., Li K., Li K.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Learning Of Temporal Motor Patterns: An Analysis Of Continuous Versus Reset Timing,"Our ability to generate well-timed sequences of movements is critical to an array of behaviors, including the ability to play a musical instrument or a video game. Here we address two questions relating to timing with the goal of better understanding the neural mechanisms underlying temporal processing. First, how does accuracy and variance change over the course of learning of complex spatiotemporal patterns? Second, is the timing of sequential responses most consistent with starting and stopping an internal timer at each interval or with continuous timing? To address these questions we used a psychophysical task in which subjects learned to reproduce a sequence of finger taps in the correct order and at the correct times- much like playing a melody at the piano. This task allowed us to calculate the variance of the responses at different time points using data from the same trials. Our results show that while ""standard"" Weber's law is clearly violated, variance does increase as a function of time squared, as expected according to the generalized form of Weber's law- which separates the source of variance into time-dependent and time-independent components. Over the course of learning, both the time-independent variance and the coefficient of the time-dependent term decrease. Our analyses also suggest that timing of sequential events does not rely on the resetting of an internal timer at each event. We describe and interpret our results in the context of computer simulations that capture some of our psychophysical findings. Specifically, we show that continuous timing, as opposed to ""reset"" timing, is consistent with population clock"" models in which timing emerges from the internal dynamics of recurrent neural networks. © 2011 Laje, Cheng and Buonomano.",doi,10.3389/fnint.2011.00061,Scopus,Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience,"Laje R., Cheng K., Buonomano D.V.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas

,"Living Emotions, Avoiding Emotions: Behavioral Investigation Of The Regulation Of Socially Driven Emotions","Emotion regulation is important for psychological well-being. Although it is known that alternative regulation strategies may have different emotional consequences, the effectiveness of such strategies for socially driven emotions remains unclear. In this study we investigated the efficacy of different forms of reappraisal on responses to the selfish and altruistic behavior of others in the Dictator Game. In Experiment 1, subjects mentalized the intentions of the other player in one condition, and took distance from the situation in the other. Emotion ratings were recorded after each offer. Compared with a baseline condition, mentalizing led subjects to experience their emotions more positively when receiving both selfish and altruistic proposals, whereas distancing decreased the valence when receiving altruistic offers, but did not affect the perception of selfish behavior. In Experiment 2, subjects played with both computer and human partners while reappraising the meaning of the player's intentions (with a human partner) or the meaning of the situation (with a computer partner). Results showed that both contexts were effectively modulated by reappraisal, however a stronger effect was observed when the donor was a human partner, as compared to a computer partner. Taken together, these results demonstrate that socially driven emotions can be successfully modulated by reappraisal strategies that focus on the reinterpretation of others' intentions. © 2013 Grecucci, Giorgetta, Bonini and Sanfey.",doi,10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00616,Scopus,Frontiers in Psychology,"Grecucci A., Giorgetta C., Bonini N., Sanfey A.G.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Lusting While Loathing: Parallel Counterdriving Of Wanting And Liking,"We show how being ""jilted""-that is, being thwarted from obtaining a desired outcome-can concurrently increase desire to obtain the outcome, but reduce its actual attractiveness. Thus, people can come to both want something more and like it less. Two experiments illustrate such disjunctions following jilting experiences. In Experiment 1, participants who failed to win a prize were willing to pay more for it than those who won it, but were also more likely to trade it away when they ultimately obtained it. In Experiment 2, failure to obtain an expected reward led to increased choice, but also negatively biased evaluation, of an item that was merely similar to that reward. Such disjunctions were exhibited particularly by individuals low in intensity of felt affect, a finding supporting an emotional basis for relative harmonization of wanting and liking. These results demonstrate how dissociable psychological subsystems for wanting and liking can be driven in opposing directions. © The Author(s) 2010.",doi,10.1177/0956797609355633,Scopus,Psychological Science,"Litt A., Khan U., Shiv B.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Machine Learning-Based Assessment Tool For Imbalance And Vestibular Dysfunction With Virtual Reality Rehabilitation System,"Background and objective: Dizziness is a major consequence of imbalance and vestibular dysfunction. Compared to surgery and drug treatments, balance training is non-invasive and more desired. However, training exercises are usually tedious and the assessment tool is insufficient to diagnose patient's severity rapidly. Methods: An interactive virtual reality (VR) game-based rehabilitation program that adopted Cawthorne-Cooksey exercises, and a sensor-based measuring system were introduced. To verify the therapeutic effect, a clinical experiment with 48 patients and 36 normal subjects was conducted. Quantified balance indices were measured and analyzed by statistical tools and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Results: In terms of balance indices, patients who completed the training process are progressed and the difference between normal subjects and patients is obvious. Conclusions: Further analysis by SVM classifier show that the accuracy of recognizing the differences between patients and normal subject is feasible, and these results can be used to evaluate patients' severity and make rapid assessment. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.cmpb.2014.04.014,Scopus,Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine,"Yeh S.-C., Huang M.-C., Wang P.-C., Fang T.-Y., Su M.-C., Tsai P.-Y., Rizzo A.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Mah-Jong-Induced Epilepsy: A Special Reflex Epilepsy In Chinese Society,"We present five patients of epilepsy in which seizures were triggered by playing or watching the traditional Chinese gambling game ""Mah-Jong."" One patient also experienced seizures while playing a computer version of the Mah-Jong game. This condition appeared to have a predominance of males (80%) and middle-aged onset (39.4 years). Four patients had generalized tonic-clonic seizures and one patient had partial seizures with secondary generalization. No spontaneous seizure occurred in these patients. Three patients had been receiving antiepileptic drug therapy, but without effective control over their seizures. Mah-Jong-induced epilepsy is a very peculiar form of complex reflex epilepsy that involves the higher mental activities. This phenomenon may consist of distinct pathophysiologic mechanisms from other reflex epilepsy induced by thinking and spatial tasks in idiopathic generalized epilepsies. This unusual reflex epilepsy is relatively benign in nature and antiepileptic drug therapy has uncertain benefits.

,Maladaptive Cognitions Predict Changes In Problematic Gaming In Highly-Engaged Adults: A 12-Month Longitudinal Study,"Understanding the role of maladaptive gaming-related cognitions may assist in screening and interventions for problematic gaming, including Internet gaming disorder (IGD). Cognitive-behavioural interventions that target specific cognitions related to gaming may be more effective than more general approaches that focus only on preoccupation with games. Although past research has identified cross-sectional associations between maladaptive cognitions and problematic gaming, it is less clear whether these cognitions can predict future changes in problematic gaming behaviour. The present study employed an 18-item measure of gaming cognition, assessing perfectionism, cognitive salience, regret, and behavioural salience, to investigate potential changes in problematic gaming over a 12-month period. The sample included 465 Australian adults (84% male, Mage = 26.2 years). It was found that individuals who became problematic gamers over 12 months had higher baseline scores on perfectionism (d = 1.20), cognitive salience (d = 0.74) and regret (d = 0.69) than those who remained non-problematic gamers. Problematic gamers who became non-problematic gamers had lower baseline perfectionism scores (d = 0.62) than those who remained problematic gamers. Cognitive change accounted for an additional 28% of variance in problematic gaming scores beyond gender, age, and frequency of gaming. These findings suggest that maladaptive gaming-related cognitions could be screened in clinical trials to aid in case formulation and inform decisions on needed interventions to deliver optimal client outcomes. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",doi,10.1016/j.addbeh.2016.10.013,Scopus,Addictive Behaviors,"Forrest C.J., King D.L., Delfabbro P.H.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas

,Measuring The Sociocultural Appeal Of Sns Games In Taiwan,"Purpose: This study aims to explore the sociocultural appeal of SNS game content from the point of view of the human emotions aroused by the interaction between the players and the games. Design/methodology/approach: The author's research methodology is based on Miryoku Engineering. The author interviewed 11 knowledgeable gamers by the evaluation grid method (EGM) and surveyed 321 players through a questionnaire in order to gather data about their preferences, which were then analysed using quantification theory type I. Findings: The semantic structure of the appeal of the games was determined from interviews with knowledgeable gamers (EGM). This structure represents a hierarchy of the relationship between the types of appeal or appeal factors, the reasons for gamers' preferences, and the specific characteristics of SNS games. According to the statistical analysis, the most important sociocultural appeal factors of SNS games are ""practicable and realizable"" and ""innovative and unique"", and these are affected in varying degrees by particular reasons and characteristics. Practical implications: The author has found that sociocultural factors influence the design of SNS games significantly. In addition, the issue of how to integrate the sociocultural factors into the design of games is critical to the success of the marketing strategies of SNS games in different areas or countries. Originality/value: The author's findings provide important information for designers and researchers of SNS games.

,Media Violence And Youth Violence: A 2-Year Longitudinal Study.,"The frequency of exposure to media violence and eight additional risk factors were path-analyzed in a 2-year longitudinal study. The exposure to media violence (total score) affected students’ later violence (β = .28) and later violent delinquency (β = .30) more strongly than other risk factors. Direct effects were also caused by risk factors assessed at Time 1, which in turn were reinforced by the remaining risk factors on the second or third stratum of analysis. Of particular importance are the findings that (1) playing violent electronic games is the strongest risk factor of violent criminality and (2) both media-stimulated and real experiences of aggressive emotions associated with the motive of revenge are core risk factors of violence in school and violent criminality. The results of our study show that the more frequently children view horror and violence films during childhood and the more frequently they play violent electronic games at the beginning of adolescence the higher will these students’ violence and delinquency be at the age of 14.",doi,10.1027/1864-1105.20.3.79,anderson2010,Journal of Media Psychology,"Hoph, W.

,Militainment And Mechatronics: Occultatio And The Veil Of Science Fiction Cool In United States Air Force Advertisements,"In 2009, the United States Air Force aired a series of science fiction-themed recruitment commercials on network television and their official YouTube channel. In these advertisements, the superimposition of science fiction imagery over depictions of Air Force operations frames these missions as near-future sci-fi adventure, ironically summarized by the tagline: ""It's not science fiction. It's what we do every day."" Focusing on an early advertisement for the Air Force's Reaper unmanned aerial vehicle, this essay explores how themes essential to the science fiction genre play a role in influencing contemporary attitudes about autonomous and semi-autonomous robotic weapons, as well as the way in which the aesthetic and functional qualities of these advanced technologies are used to frame moral arguments about their use. As a reconfiguration of the near-future battleground in the guise of science fiction, the ""Reaper"" ad reveals the way in which science fiction has come to serve as a functional-aesthetic benchmark and cultural sounding board, against which ""every day"" technologies can be measured and claims about their value, ethos, and social appeal are made. This essay explores the ethical entanglements between science fiction film and video games, and military technology, and the complex role science fiction plays in influencing public attitudes towards military technologies. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",doi,10.1007/s10676-013-9316-3,Scopus,Ethics and Information Technology,Maradin III N.R.,2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Minecraft And The Building Blocks Of Creative Individuality,"This article situates the video game Minecraft along with Robinson Crusoe in a genealogy of island fictions to show how Minecraft reinterprets narratives of creative subjects and invention. By reading Minecraft through histories of construction toys, modern conceptions of creativity, and digital practices of modding, I argue that Minecraft allows players to experiment with various social and environmental conditions historically central to debates over shaping creative subjects, rooted in island narratives as the generic site for negotiating conflicts between individual autonomy and social dependence. I show how Minecraft players become inventive subjects through simulating Crusoe’s island and performing code work with the game as software embedded in networks of players, programmers, and digital technologies. © 2016 by Johns Hopkins University Press and the Society for Literature, Science, and the Arts.",doi,10.1353/con.2016.0030,Scopus,Configurations,Nguyen J.,2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Mocalc: A New Graphical User Interface For Molecular Calculations,"A new computer program called MoCalc (Molecular Calculations) has been designed to help the computational chemistry practitioner in the task of performing and analyzing molecular calculations. MoCalc is a graphical user interface for the MO calculation programs Gamess and Mopac, and uses Rasmol and Babel for molecule display and file conversion, respectively. In its initial version, MoCalc can execute the following operations: (a) create and handle Gamess and Mopac input files; (b) import any kind of molecular geometry supported by Babel and paste it as Cartesian, internal, or Gaussian-type coordinates on the input file; (c) convert Gamess and Mopac output files to inputs of both programs; (d) edit and validate the keywords that control the Gamess and Mopac calculation procedure; (e) display the input (Mopac) and output (Gamess and Mopac) molecular geometries; (f) run single or multiple (batch) calculations, either interactively or in background; (g) automatically open the output files as soon as the calculation finishes; (h) extract results from the output files, such as energy, charges, dipole, population analysis, wave function, bond orders, and valence analysis, and display them in spreadsheets; (i) calculate reactivity indices derived from the frontier orbital theory and the root-mean-square (rms) deviation of input and output geometries. All the results generated by MoCalc can be promptly transferred to text editors and electronic spreadsheets, which facilitate a detailed subsequent analysis and the publication of the results. MoCalc can also perform graphical and numerical comparative analysis of the some results when more than one output file is loaded. The program was coded in Visual Basic and runs in Windows 95/98/NT4/ME/2000/XP environments. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",doi,10.1002/jcc.20151,Scopus,Journal of Computational Chemistry,"Depizzol D.B., Paiva M.H.M., Santos T.O.D., Gaudio A.C.",2005,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Model Forecast Improvements With Decreased Horizontal Grid Spacing Over Finescale Intermountain Orography During The 2002 Olympic Winter Games,"Forecasts produced for the 2002 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games (23 January-25 March 2002) by a multiply nested version of the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University-National Center for Atmospheric Research (PSU-NCAR) Mesoscale Model (MM5) are examined to determine if decreasing horizontal grid spacing to 4 km improves forecast accuracy over the finescale topography of the Intermountain West. The verification is based on high-density observations collected by the Meso West cooperative networks, including approximately 200 wind and temperature sites and 100 precipitation sites across northern Utah. Wind and precipitation forecasts produced by the 4-km MM5 domain were m ore accurate (based on traditional measures) than those of its parent 12-km domain. The most significant improvements in wind speed forecasts occurred at night in valleys and lowland locations where the topography of the 4-km domain produced more accurate nocturnal flows. Wind direction forecast improvements were most substantial at mountain sites where the better topographic resolution of the 4-km domain more accurately reflected the exposure of these locations to the free atmosphere. The 4-km domain also produced quantitative precipitation forecasts that were either equally (small events) or more (large events) accurate than the 12-km domain. Precipitation bias errors varied substantially between the two domains since the representation of the region's narrow, steeply sloped, basin-and-range topography improved dramatically at 4-kM grid spacing. Curiously, the overall accuracy of t emperature forecasts by the 4-km domain was not significantly better than that of the 12-km domain. This was due to an inability of the MM5 to properly simulate nocturnal and persistent cold pools within mountain valleys and the lowlands upstream of the Wasatch Mountains. Paradoxically, the added resolution of the 4-km domain, coupled with the failure of this version of the MM5 to fully capture the nocturnal and persistent cold pools, resulted in poorer skill scores. At upper elevations, which are typically above the cold pools, the 4-km domain was substantially more accurate. These results illustrate that decreasing horizontal grid spacing to less than 10 km does improve wind and precipitation forecasts over finescale Intermountain West topography. It is hypothesized that model improvements will ultimately enable the advantages of added model resolution to be fully realized for temperature forecasts over the Intermountain West. © 2005 American Meteorological Society.",doi,10.1175/WAF865.1,Scopus,Weather and Forecasting,"Hart K.A., Steenburgh W.J., Onton D.J.",2005,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Modeling And Simulation Of Pedestrian Behaviors In Crowded Places,"Pedestrian simulation has many applications in computer games, military simulations, and animation systems. A realistic pedestrian simulation requires a realistic pedestrian behavioral model that takes into account the various behavioral aspects of a real pedestrian. In this article, we describe our work on such a model, which aims to generate human-like pedestrian behaviors. To this end, various important factors in a real-pedestrian's decision-making process are considered in our model. These factors include a pedestrian's sensory attention, memory, and navigational behaviors. In particular, a two-level navigation model is proposed to generate realistic navigational behavior. As a result, our pedestrian model is able to generate various realistic behaviors such as overtaking, waiting, side-stepping and lane-forming in a crowded area. The simulated pedestrians are also able to navigate through complex environment, given an abstract map of the environment. © 2011 ACM.",doi,10.1145/1921598.1921604,Scopus,ACM Transactions on Modeling and Computer Simulation,"Koh W.L., Zhou S.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Modes Of Immersion And Stress Induced By Commercial (Off-The-Shelf) 3D Games,"Developing a stress-management training (SMT) system and protocol for soldiers can help them cope better with stress experienced in theatre operations. Using 3D horror games in virtual reality (VR) can present an attractive simulation method for soldiers. This study was conducted to find out whether it is possible to stress soldiers moderately using VR and which technology is more efficient to do so. A total of 47 soldiers returning from Afghanistan played two 3D firstperson shooter (FPS)/horror games (Killing Floor and Left 4 Dead) on three different types of immersive technologies (a 22-inch stereoscopic monitor, a 73-inch stereoscopic TV and a CAVE™). As a control and reference comparison of induced stress, participants were exposed to the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), a standardized stress-inducing procedure. Results were supporting of our work, devising an effective low-cost and high-buy-in approach to assist in teaching and practicing stress-management skills. Repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) revealed statistically significant increases in the soldiers’ respiration rates and heart rates while playing the 3D games and during the TSSTs. No significant interactions were found. Increases in physiological arousal among the soldiers were significant when comparing the baseline to the immersion and to the TSST, but not when comparing both stressors. Immersion in 3D games is proposed as a practical and cost-effective option to create a context that allows practicing SMT. © 2013 The Society for Modeling.",doi,10.1177/1548512912446359,Scopus,Journal of Defense Modeling and Simulation,"Bouchard S., Bernier F., Boivin É., Guitard T., Laforest M., Dumoulin S., Robillard G.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Mood Swings: Design And Evaluation Of Affective Interactive Art,"The field of affective computing is concerned with developing emphatic products, such as affective consumer products, affective games, and affective art. This paper describes Mood Swings, an affective interactive art system, which interprets and visualizes affect expressed by a person. Mood Swings consists of eight luminous orbs that react to movement. When a person experiences certain emotion, his/her movements are claimed to have certain characteristics. Based on the integration of a framework for affective movements and a color model, Mood Swings recognizes affective movement characteristics, and subsequently displays a color that matches the expressed emotion. Mood Swings was evaluated in a museum for contemporary art by 36 museum visitors. The Trajectory of Interaction (ToI) was applied to assess common phases in interacting with Mood Swings, i.e. response, control, contemplation, belonging, and disengagement. The visitors who interacted with Mood Swings were videotaped. Results showed that The ToI could be identified, although not all phases were experienced by everyone. Few participants reached the contemplation phase and none of them reached the belonging phase. All together, the introduction of the new affective interactive art system was a success. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.",doi,10.1080/13614560903131898,Scopus,New Review of Hypermedia and Multimedia,"Bialoskorski L.S.S., Westerink J.H.D.M., Van Den Broek E.L.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Motivational Elements Of Digital Instructional Games: A Study Of Young L2 Learners’ Game Designs,"This article focuses on the design of digital instructional game (DIG) tasks for young second language (L2) learners. The aim of the study is to identify motivational task elements based on what children respond to positively in games and incorporate into their own L2 vocabulary learning game designs. Eighty-two sixth-grade students (ages 11–12 years) in Japan were first asked to identify game elements by examining existing games and then to design games incorporating DIG tasks of their own and peer-evaluate them. Building on previous work (Butler, 2015), the study uses a mixed-methods approach to examine how both task-intrinsic characteristics and implementation conditions were realized in innovative and engaging DIG tasks by children. Although the study focuses on young learners, the findings might be applied to any type of task, including both digital and physical tasks for adults as well as for children. The article concludes with suggestions for how to design instructional materials which allow individualized learning and encourage autonomy in order to cater to the genuine interests of learners and to invoke intrinsic motivation for learning. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.",doi,10.1177/1362168816683560,Scopus,Language Teaching Research,Butler Y.G.,2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Multi-Robot Coalition Formation,"As the community strives towards autonomous multi-robot systems, there is a need for these systems to autonomously form coalitions to complete assigned missions. Numerous coalition formation algorithms have been proposed in the software agent literature. Algorithms exist that form agent coalitions in both super additive and non-super additive environments. The algorithmic techniques vary from negotiation-based protocols in multi-agent system (MAS) environments to those based on computation in distributed problem solving (DPS) environments. Coalition formation behaviors have also been discussed in relation to game theory. Despite the plethora of MAS coalition formation literature, to the best of our knowledge none of the proposed algorithms have been demonstrated with an actual multi-robot system. There exists a discrepancy between the multi-agent algorithms and their applicability to the multi-robot domain. This paper aims to bridge that discrepancy by unearthing the issues that arise while attempting to tailor these algorithms to the multi-robot domain. A well-known multi-agent coalition formation algorithm has been studied in order to identify the necessary modifications to facilitate its application to the multi-robot domain. This paper reports multi-robot coalition formation results based upon simulation and actual robot experiments. A multi-agent coalition formation algorithm has been demonstrated on an actual robot system. © 2006 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TRO.2006.878948,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Robotics,"Vig L., Adams J.A.",2006,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Negativity Bias In Attitude Learning: A Possible Indicator Of Vulnerability To Emotional Disorders?,"Negativity biases, i.e., tendencies for negative features and interpretations to predominate over positive, are known to play a role in the etiology and maintenance of emotional disorders. Both depression and anxiety have been associated with such negative cognitive styles. Recently, Fazio, R.H., Eiser, J.R., and Shook, N.J. [(2004). Attitude formation through exploration: Valence asymmetries. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 87, 293-311] have observed similar valence asymmetries in the domain of attitude formation and generalization. The present research examined the possibility that the extent to which individuals display a learning bias in attitude formation is related to negative cognitive style and emotional disorder symptoms. Participants played a computer game that required learning whether novel stimuli produced positive or negative outcomes. Poorer learning was associated with more negative cognitive style, greater depression, and a tendency toward greater anxiety. Interestingly, these relations were most evident with respect to the learning of the positive stimuli, suggesting that an under-appreciation of positive objects and events may underlie vulnerability to emotional disorders. The potential value of various indices of negativity bias that can be assessed when examining attitude formation and generalization is discussed. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

,Neural Basis Of Emotional Decision Making In Trait Anxiety,"Although trait anxiety has been associated with risk decision making, whether it is related to risk per se or to the feeling of the risk, as well as the underlying neurocognitive mechanisms, remains unclear. Using a decision-making task with a manipulation of frame (i.e., written description of options as a potential gain or loss) and functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated the neurocognitive relationship between trait anxiety and decision making. The classic framing effect was observed: participants chose the safe option when it was described as a potential gain, but they avoided the same option when it was described as a potential loss. Most importantly, trait anxiety was positively correlated with this behavioral bias. Trait anxiety was also positively correlated with amygdala-based ""emotional"" system activation and its coupling with the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) when decisions were consistent with the framing effect, but negatively correlated with the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC)-based ""analytic"" system activation and its connectivity to the vmPFC when decisions ran counter to the framing effect. Our findings suggest that trait anxiety is not associated with subjective risk preference but an evaluative bias of emotional information in decision making, underpinned by a hyperactive emotional system and a hypoactive analytic system in the brain. ©2013 the authors.",doi,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1253-13.2013,Scopus,Journal of Neuroscience,"Xu P., Gu R., Broster L.S., Wu R., Van Dam N.T., Jiang Y., Fan J., Luo Y.-J.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Neural Contributions To Flow Experience During Video Game Playing,"Video games are an exciting part of new media. Although game play has been intensively studied, the underlying neurobiology is still poorly understood. Flow theory is a well-established model developed to describe subjective game experience. In 13 healthy male subjects, we acquired fMRI data during free play of a video game and analyzed brain activity based on the game content. In accordance with flow theory, we extracted the following factors from the game content: (i) balance between ability and challenge; (ii) concentration and focus; (iii) direct feedback of action results; (iv) clear goals; and (v) control over the situation/activity. We suggest that flow is characterized by specific neural activation patterns and that the latter can be assessed-at least partially-by content factors contributing to the emergence of flow. Each of the content factors was characterized by specific and distinguishable brain activation patterns, encompassing reward-related midbrain structures, as well as cognitive and sensorimotor networks. The activation of sensory and motor networks in the conjunction analyses underpinned the central role of simulation for flow experience. Flow factors can be validated with functional brain imaging which can improve the understanding of human emotions and motivational processes during media entertainment. © The Author (2011).",doi,10.1093/scan/nsr021,Scopus,Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience,"Klasen M., Weber R., Kircher T.T.J., Mathiak K.A., Mathiak K.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Neural Mechanisms Of The Testosterone-Aggression Relation: The Role Of Orbitofrontal Cortex,"Testosterone plays a role in aggressive behavior, but themechanisms remain unclear. The present study tested the hypothesis that testosterone influences aggression through the OFC, a region implicated in self-regulation and impulse control. In a decision-making paradigm in which people chose between aggression and monetary reward (the ultimatum game), testosterone was associated with increased aggression following social provocation (rejecting unfair offers). The effect of testosterone on aggression was explained by reduced activity in the medial OFC. The findings suggest that testosterone increases the propensity toward aggression because of reduced activation of the neural circuitry of impulse control and self-regulation. © 2009 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",doi,10.1162/jocn.2009.21389,Scopus,Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience,"Mehta P.H., Beer J.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Neural Mechanisms Underlying The Orienting Response To Subject's Own Name: An Event-Related Potential Study,"Neural processes underlying the orienting response (OR) to subject's own name (SON) were investigated using the oddball paradigm. Subjects were presented with SON, subject's parent's name, and unfamiliar persons' names while they played a video game and ignored the auditory stimuli. A P3a-like frontal positivity (P440, 440ms) indexing OR was elicited by SON only when it was the rare stimulus and its amplitude decreased with the repeated presentation of SON. Preceding the P440, SON consistently elicited an early frontal negativity (SON negativity, 170-270ms), including when SON was the high-probability stimulus, and unlike the P440, this negativity did not habituate. These results conform to the hypothesis that early preattentive processing of speech sounds distinguishes SON from other names irrespective of short-term stimulus context, and that this culminates in an OR only when SON is evaluated as being contextually meaningful. © 2012 Society for Psychophysiological Research.",doi,10.1111/j.1469-8986.2012.01363.x,Scopus,Psychophysiology,"Tateuchi T., Itoh K., Nakada T.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Neural Strategies For Selective Attention Distinguish Fast-Action Video Game Players,"We investigated the psychophysical and neurophysiological differences between fast-action video game players (specifically first person shooter players, FPS) and non-action players (role-playing game players, RPG) in a visual search task. We measured both successful detections (hit rates) and steady-state visually evoked EEG potentials (SSVEPs). Search difficulty was varied along two dimensions: number of adjacent attended and ignored regions (1, 2 and 4), and presentation rate of novel search arrays (3, 8.6 and 20 Hz). Hit rates decreased with increasing presentation rates and number of regions, with the FPS players performing on average better than the RPG players. The largest differences in hit rate, between groups, occurred when four regions were simultaneously attended. We computed signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of SSVEPs and used partial least squares regression to model hit rates, SNRs and their relationship at 3 Hz and 8.6 Hz. The following are the most significant results: RPG players' parietal responses to the attended 8.6 Hz flicker were predictive of hit rate and were positively correlated with it, indicating attentional signal enhancement. FPS players' parietal responses to the ignored 3 Hz flicker were predictive of hit rate and were positively correlated with it, indicating distractor suppression. Consistent with these parietal responses, RPG players' frontal responses to the attended 8.6 Hz flicker, increased as task difficulty increased with number of regions; FPS players' frontal responses to the ignored 3 Hz flicker increased with number of regions. Thus the FPS players appear to employ an active suppression mechanism to deploy selective attention simultaneously to multiple interleaved regions, while RPG primarily use signal enhancement. These results suggest that fast-action gaming can affect neural strategies and the corresponding networks underlying attention, presumably by training mechanisms of distractor suppression. © 2012 The Author(s).",doi,10.1007/s10548-012-0232-3,Scopus,Brain Topography,"Krishnan L., Kang A., Sperling G., Srinivasan R.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Neurobehavioral Test Performance In The Third National Health And Nutrition Examination Survey,"The third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) contained three computerized neurobehavioral tests from the Neurobehavioral Evaluation System (NES): simple reaction time, symbol-digit substitution and serial digit learning. The neurobehavioral data that were collected came from a nationally representative sample of adults 20-59 years old. Performance on the tests was related to sex, age, education level, family income and race-ethnicity. Performance decreased as age increased, and increased as education level and family income increased. Differences in performance between sexes, levels of education and racial-ethnic groups tended to decrease as family income increased. The relationship between age and performance on the symbol-digit substitution test varied by education level and by racial-ethnic group. The relationship between age and performance on the serial digit learning test varied by racial-ethnic group. Questionnaire variables that were related to performance on one or more of the tests included the reported amount of last night's sleep, energy level, computer or video game familiarity, alcoholic beverages within the last 3 h and effort. Persons who took the tests in English or Spanish performed differently on the symbol-digit substitution and serial digit learning tests.

,"Nintendo Wii Sports And Wii Fit Game Analysis, Validation, And Application To Stroke Rehabilitation","Background: Interactive video gaming has become ubiquitous in the practice of rehabilitation. The Nintendo Wii is one such system. Interactive gaming can promote intensive task-based therapy in a manner that is motivating for the user. Widespread enthusiasm for consoles and their games prompted us to analyze the games for their rehabilitation elements related to improving balance and mobility for individuals poststroke. Purpose: The purpose of this article is to provide a game analysis for clinical application and evaluation of the game elements for research on interactive video gaming. Methods: Using a team of game players and raters, 5 tables (1 for the Wii Sports and 4 for the Wii Fit) were developed and validated. The tables consist of 3 categories: game description, impairments targeted (strength, endurance, balance, and coordination), and feedback provided (knowledge of performance [KP] and knowledge of results [KR]). Two domain content experts established face validity. Construct validity was performed by 2 therapist-raters who had more than 15 years' clinical experience and postgraduate training in motor learning. Observations about the games including the fidelity of the interfaces, the nature of the feedback, and some of the challenges to adapting the games for rehabilitation are presented. Results: An 80% agreement between raters set as the criterion for establishing the construct validity was met for feedback evaluation. There was 100% agreement on impairment ratings. Games provide a greater amount of KR compared with KP. Conclusion: Given the preponderance of KR, therapists will need to monitor motor performance. Adaptation of interactive video consoles for rehabilitation requires careful evaluation of the games' attributes using relevant rehabilitation construits. © 2011 Thomas Land Publishers, Inc.",doi,10.1310/tsr1806-701,Scopus,Topics in Stroke Rehabilitation,"Deutsch J.E., Brettler A., Smith C., Welsh J., John R., Guarrera-Bowlby P., Kafri M.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Nurses' Knowledge And Skill Retention Following Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Training: A Review Of The Literature.,"This paper reports a literature review examining factors that enhance retention of knowledge and skills during and after resuscitation training, in order to identify educational strategies that will optimize survival for victims of cardiopulmonary arrest. Poor knowledge and skill retention following cardiopulmonary resuscitation training for nursing and medical staff has been documented over the past 20 years. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation training is mandatory for nursing staff and is important as nurses often discover the victims of in-hospital cardiac arrest. Many different methods of improving this retention have been devised and evaluated. However, the content and style of this training lack standardization. A literature review was undertaken using the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, MEDLINE and British Nursing Index databases and the keywords 'cardiopulmonary resuscitation', 'basic life support', 'advanced life support' and 'training'. Papers published between 1992 and 2002 were obtained and their reference lists scrutinized to identify secondary references, of these the ones published within the same 10-year period were also included. Those published in the English language that identified strategies to enhance the acquisition or retention of Cardiopulmonary resuscitation skills and knowledge were included in the review. One hundred and five primary and 157 secondary references were identified. Of these, 24 met the criteria and were included in the final literature sample. Four studies were found pertaining to cardiac arrest simulation, three to peer tuition, four to video self-instruction, three to the use of different resuscitation guidelines, three to computer-based learning programmes, two to voice-activated manikins, two to automated external defibrillators, one to self-instruction, one to gaming and the one to the use of action cards. Resuscitation training should be based on in-hospital scenarios and current evidence-based guidelines, including recognition of sick patients, and should be taught using simulations of a variety of cardiac arrest scenarios. This will ensure that the training reflects the potential situations that nurses may face in practice. Nurses in clinical areas, who rarely see cardiac arrests, should receive automated external defibrillation training and have access to defibrillators to prevent delays in resuscitation. Staff should be formally assessed using a manikin with a feedback mechanism or an expert instructor to ensure that chest compressions and ventilations are adequate at the time of training. Remedial training must be provided as often as required. Resuscitation training equipment should be made available at ward/unit level to allow self-study and practice to prevent deterioration between updates. Video self-instruction has been shown to improve competence in resuscitation. An in-hospital scenario-based video should be devised and tested to assess the efficacy of this medium in",doi,10.1111/j.1365-2648.2005.03491.x,pubmed,Journal of advanced nursing,"Hamilton, Rosemary",2006,NA,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Observations And Simulations Of Snow Surface Temperature On Cross-Country Ski Racing Courses,"Fast skis are essential for an Olympic cross-country skiing athlete. Accurate and timely estimates of the snow surface conditions on a race course are needed to prepare race skis. For training purposes prior to the 2010 Winter Olympics, snow surface and snowpack observations were collected on the cross-country racing track at the Whistler Olympic Park, British Columbia during February 2008 and 2009. During periods with clear skies, snow surface temperatures varied by more than 10 °C around the course while temperatures in the stadium area increased by more than 16 °C from morning to early afternoon. Simulations using the SNOWPACK model of snow surface temperature were within 1 °C of those measured during a four day observation period in the stadium area. Idealized simulations were completed varying cloud cover, slope and aspect. These simulations provided realistic appearing changes in snow surface temperature as a function of time of day. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",doi,10.1016/j.coldregions.2010.12.003,Scopus,Cold Regions Science and Technology,"Wagner W., Horel J.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Only Social Feedback Reduces Age-Related Prospective Memory Deficits In Virtual Week,"Background: Prospective memory, or remembering to do things in the future, is crucial for independent living in old age. Although there is evidence of substantial age-related deficits in memory for intentions, older adults have demonstrated the ability to compensate for their deficits in everyday life. The present study investigated feedback as a strategy for facilitating prospective memory in the elderly. Method: Young and older adults played a computer-based task, Virtual Week, in which they had to remember to carry out life-like intentions. After each virtual day, specific feedback on prospective memory performance was automatically provided on the computer screen that participants either proceeded through by themselves (non-social feedback) or were taken through by an experimenter (social feedback). The control group received no feedback. Results: We found that, compared with no-feedback group, only social feedback substantially reduced the age-related deficit in prospective memory. Older adults significantly benefited from feedback provided by the experimenter on the tasks of intermediate difficulty. Unexpectedly, prospective memory with non-social feedback was not only worse than with social feedback, but it was not any better than without any feedback at all. Conclusions: The results extended previous findings on the effectiveness of feedback in improving the memory performance of older adults to include memory for intentions. Despite the feedback meeting the critical recommendations of being specific, objective, and well-targeted, it was ineffective when the feedback displayed on the computer was not introduced by the experimenter. This has implications for computerized training tasks where automated feedback is considered crucial.

,Orienting-Defense Responses And Psychophysiological Reactivity In Isolated Clinic Versus Sustained Hypertension,"This study sought to determine whether patients with white-coat or isolated clinic hypertension (ICH) show, in comparison to patients with sustained hypertension (SH), a defense response pattern to novel stimuli and an enhanced psychophysiological reactivity to stress. Forty-three patients with essential hypertension were divided into two groups after 16 days of self-monitoring blood pressure (BP): ICH (24 men; self-measured BP < 135/85 mmHg) and SH (19 men; self-measured BP ≥ 135/85 mmHg). Defense responses were measured as the cardiac changes to phasic non-aversive auditory stimuli. Psychophysiological reactivity (heart and breath rate, blood volume pulse, electromyography, and skin conductance) was measured during mental arithmetic and video game tasks. The standard deviation of self-measured BPs and the difference between mean BPs at work and at home were used as indicators of cardiovascular reactivity to daily stress. No significant differences were seen in defense responses or psychophysiological reactivity to laboratory or naturally occurring stressors. These results do not support the hypothesis that ICH can be explained in terms of a generalized hyperreactivity to novel or stressful stimuli.

,People Do Not Feel Guilty About Exploiting Machines,"Guilt and envy play an important role in social interaction. Guilt occurs when individuals cause harm to others or break social norms. Envy occurs when individuals compare themselves unfavorably to others and desire to benefit from the others' advantage. In both cases, these emotions motivate people to act and change the status quo: following guilt, people try to make amends for the perceived transgression, and following envy, people try to harm envied others. In this article, we present two experiments that study participants' experience of guilt and envy when engaginginsocial decision making with machines and humans. The results showed that, though experiencing the same level of envy, people felt considerably less guilt with machines than with humans. These effects occurred both with subjective and behavioral measures of guilt and envy, and in three different economic games: public goods, ultimatum, and dictator game. This poses an important challenge for human-computer interaction because, as shown here, it leads people to systematically exploit machines, when compared to humans. We discuss theoretical and practical implications for the design of human-machine interaction systems that hope to achieve the kind of efficiency - cooperation, fairness, reciprocity, etc. - we see in human-human interaction. © 2016 ACM.",doi,10.1145/2890495,Scopus,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,"De Melo C., Marsella S., Gratch J.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Perception-Based Lossy Haptic Compression Considerations For Velocity-Based Interactions,The ability of technology to transmit multi-media is very dependent on compression techniques. In particular lossy compression has been used in image compression (jpeg) audio compression (mp3) and video compression (mpg) to allow the transmission of audio and video over broadband network connections. Recently the sense of touch or haptics is becoming more important with its addition in computer games or in cruder applications such as vibrations in a cell phone. As haptic technology improves the ability to transmit compressed force sensations becomes more critical. Most lossy audio and visual compression techniques rely on the lack of sensitivity in humans to pick up detailed information in certain scenarios. Similarly limitations in the sensitivity of human touch could be exploited to create haptic models with much less detail and thus requiring smaller bandwidth. The focus of this paper is on the force thresholds of the human haptic system that can be used in a psychophysically motivated lossy haptic (force) compression technique. Most of the research in this field has measured the just noticeable difference (JND) of the human haptic system with a human user in static interaction with a stationary rigid object. In this paper our focus involves cases where the human user or the object are in relative motion. An example of such an application would be the haptic rendering of the user's hand in contact with of a high-viscous material or interacting with a highly deformable object. Thus an approach is presented to measure the force threshold based on the velocity of the user's hand motion. Two experiments are conducted to detect the absolute force threshold (AFT) of the human haptic system using methodologies from the field of psychophysics. The AFTs are detected for three different ranges of velocity of the user's hand motion. This study implies that when a user's hand is in motion fewer haptic details are required to be stored calculated or transmitted. Finally the implications of this study on a more complete future study will be discussed. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.,doi,10.1007/s00530-007-0106-9,Scopus,Multimedia Systems,"Zadeh M.H., Wang D., Kubica E.",2008,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Persistent Affective Biases In Human Amygdala Response Following Implicit Priming With Negative Emotion Concepts,"To what extent do past experiences shape our behaviors, perceptions, and thoughts even without explicit knowledge of these influences? Behavioral research has demonstrated that various cognitive processes can be influenced by conceptual representations implicitly primed during a preceding and unrelated task. Here we investigated whether emotion processing might also be influenced by prior incidental exposure to negative semantic material and which neural substrates would mediate these effects. During a first (priming) task, participants performed a variant of the hangman game with either negative or neutral emotion-laden words. Subsequently, they performed a second, unrelated visual task with fearful and neutral faces presented at attended or unattended locations. Participants were generally not aware of any relationships between the two tasks. We found that priming with emotional words enhanced amygdala sensitivity to faces in the subsequent visual task, while decreasing discriminative responses to threat. Furthermore, the magnitude of the induced bias in behavior and amygdala activation was predicted by the effectiveness of semantic access observed in the priming task. This demonstrates that emotional processing can be modulated by implicit influence of environmental information processed at an earlier time, independently of volitional control. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",doi,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.06.004,Scopus,NeuroImage,"Pichon S., Rieger S.W., Vuilleumier P.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Peter Ueberroth's Legacy: How The 1984 Los Angeles Olympics Changed The Trajectory Of The Olympic Movement,"Interest in staging the Olympic Games waned in cities across the world in the 1970s, given the intrusion of world geo-politics on recent festivals and the exploding costs of staging them. In running the show in Los Angeles, Peter Ueberroth prioritised pre-existing facilities, a new and more profitable means of affiliating corporate sponsors with an organising committee, and maximising revenue from television rights negotiations. His success encouraged cities to re-enter the bidding for Olympic festivals, and when combined with initiatives launched by the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) President, Juan Antonio Samaranch, brighter days for the IOC lay ahead in the 1980s and 1990s. Yet, Ueberroth's legacy was not well managed ultimately by Samaranch, who permitted the enhanced competition among bid cities, and the behaviour of bid officials and some of his own members to endanger the IOC's reputation and autonomy, highlighted notably by the Salt Lake City scandal. Last, in light of the cost of the Olympic festivals in Beijing and Sochi, and its dampening effect on the current host city bidding environment, it seems wise for the IOC and future bid cities to re-visit the Ueberroth model for lessons in cost containment, and like Ueberroth, exhibit a willingness to explore novel, more cost-effective means for cities to host the Olympic Games. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",doi,10.1080/09523367.2014.958665,Scopus,International Journal of the History of Sport,Wenn S.R.,2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Phasic Emotional Reactions To Video Game Events: A Psychophysiological Investigation,"We examined emotional valence- and arousal-related phasic psychophysiological responses to different video game events among 36 young adults who played Super Monkey Ball 2 (Sega Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). Event-related changes in zygomaticus major, corrugator supercilii, and orbicularis oculi electromyographic activity, skin conductance level, and cardiac interbeat intervals were recorded. Instantaneous game events elicited reliable psychophysiological responses indexing valence and arousal. A largely linear, positive dose-response relationship between rewards obtained in the game and phasic increases in arousal was revealed. The valence of the emotional response varied as a function of the player's active participation (active coping). In addition, not only positive events, but also some putatively negative events elicited positively valenced arousal. The findings extend our understanding of the phasic changes in the emotional state during video games and a dynamic flow of events and action and may have several applied implications (e.g., for game design).

,Physical And Physiological Demands Of Elite Team Handball,"Physical and physiological demands of elite team handball. J Strength Cond Res 26(12): 3365-3375, 2012-This study aimed to analyze elite team handball physical and physiological demands during match play. Time-motion (N = 30) and heart rate (HR; N = 60) analyses were performed throughout 10 official matches. The defined locomotor categories were standing still, walking, jogging, fast running, sprinting, backwards movement, sideways medium-intensity movement, and sideways high-intensity movement, and playing actions studied were jumps, shots, stops when preceded by high-intensity activities, changes of direction and one-on-one situations. During matches, the mean distances covered were 4,370 ± 702.0 m. Around 80% of the total time was spent standing still (43.0 ± 9.27%) and walking (35.0 ± 6.94%) and only 0.460.31% with sprinting. The most frequent high-intensity actions were stops, changes of direction, and one-on-one situations. Effective mean HR was 157 ± 18.0 b.min-1 (82 6 9.3% of HRmax), and total HR was 139 ± 31.9 b.min-1 (72 ± 16.7% of HRmax). The HR, time spent in high-intensity activities, frequency of stops, changes of direction, one-on-one situations, and most intense periods of the game were higher during the first half than during the second half (p ≤ 0.05). The opposite was observed for the number of time outs and the time between each change of activity (p = 0.00). Handball is an intermittent exercise that primarily uses aerobic metabolism, interspersed by high-intensity actions that greatly tax anaerobic metabolism. Additionally, exercise intensity decreases from the first to the second half of the match, suggesting that neuromuscular fatigue may occur during the game. The training of elite handball players should comprise exercises targeting the ability to perform specific high-intensity actions throughout the game and to rapidly recover during the less intense periods. © 2012 National Strength and Conditioning Association. © 2012 National Strength and Conditioning Association.",doi,10.1519/JSC.0b013e318248aeee,Scopus,Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research,"PoVoas S.C.A., Seabra A.F.T., AscensaO A.A.M.R., MagalhaEs J., Soares J.M.C., And Rebelo A.N.C.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,"Physical Effort, Energy Expenditure, And Motivation In Structured And Unstructured Active Video Games: A Randomized Controlled Trial","Purpose. The goals of the study were: a) to compare the way that two types of active video games (AVG) influenced physical effort and motivation in young adults; b) to compare direct and indirect instruments and use an indirect instrument (heart rate analysis) as a practical tool to verify physical effort in AVGs. Methods. Initially, 16 healthy but physically inactive young adult males with no AVGs experience took part in the randomized control trial. After the baseline assessments of blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and aerobic capacity (AE), the participants were randomized into two groups: structured AVG (n = 6) and unstructured AVG (n = 7) (3 dropouts). They played 3 sessions a week, during 6 weeks. Direct and indirect metabolic measurements were made. To compare direct and indirect AE, Student t-test was used for related samples. Changes (group × time) in HR, perceived exertion (PE), calculated energy expenditure (EE), calculated metabolic equivalent (MET), and motivation (points) were assessed with the two-way analysis of variance. Results. There were no differences between direct and indirect AE (36.0 ± 5.2 vs 33.9 ± 6.0 ml/kg/min: unstructured; 39.0 ± 5.9 vs 37.7 ± 5.9 ml/kg/min; p > 0.05). No differences were observed in maximal HR, PE, or motivation (p > 0.05). Statistically significant differences referred to average HR, MET, and EE over the sessions (p < 0.05). HR and EE values were higher in structured than in unstructured AVGs. Conclusions. HR and EE responses of structured AVGs turned out higher than those of unstructured AVGs, and the measurements proved efficient to analyse physical effort in AVGs in a long-term perspective.",doi,10.1515/humo-2016-0021,Scopus,Human Movement,"De Brito-Gomes J.L., Perrier-Melo R.J., Melo De Oliveira S.F., De Sá Pereira Guimarães F.J., Da Cunha Costa M.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Physio-Behavioral Coupling In A Cooperative Team Task: Contributors And Relations,"Research indicates that coactors performing cooperative tasks often exhibit spontaneous and unintended similarities in their physiological and behavioral responses-a phenomenon referred to here as physiobehavioral coupling (PBC). The purpose of this research was to identify contributors to PBC; examine relationships between PBC, team performance, and perceived team attributes (e.g., cohesion, trust); and compare a set of time-series measures(cross-correlation [CC], cross-recurrence quantification analysis [CRQA], and cross-fuzzy entropy [CFEn]) in their characterization of PBC across comparisons. To accomplish this, PBC was examined in human postural sway (PS) and cardiac interbeat intervals (IBIs) from dyadic teams performing a fast-paced puzzle task (Quadra-a variant of the video game Tetris). Results indicated that observed levels of PBC were not a chance occurrence, but instead driven by features of the team-task environment, and that PBC was likely influenced by similar individual task demands and interpersonal coordination dynamics that were not ""unique"" to a particular team. Correlation analysis revealed that PBC exhibited negative relationships with team performance and team attributes, which were interpreted to reflect complementary coordination (as opposed to mimicry) during task performance, potentially due to differentiated team roles. Finally, qualitative comparison of timeseries measures used to characterize PBC indicated that CRQA percent recurrence and CFEn (both nonlinear measures) settled on mostly analogous characterizations, whereas linear CC did not. The disparity observed between the linear and nonlinear measures highlights underlying computational and interpretational differences between the two families of statistics and supports the use of multiple metrics for characterizing PBC. © 2013 American Psychological Association.",doi,10.1037/a0033125,Scopus,Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance,"Strang A.J., Funke G.J., Russell S.M., Dukes A.W., Middendorf M.S.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Physiologic Responses And Energy Expenditure Of Kinect Active Video Game Play In Schoolchildren,"Objective: To evaluate the physiologic responses and energy expenditure of active video gaming using Kinect for the Xbox 360. Design: Comparison study. Setting: Kirkby Sports College Centre for Learning, Liverpool, England. Participants: Eighteen schoolchildren (10 boys and 8 girls) aged 11 to 15 years. Main Exposure: A comparison of a traditional sedentary video game and 2 Kinect activity-promoting video games, Dance Central and Kinect Sports Boxing, each played for 15 minutes. Physiologic responses and energy expenditure were measured using a metabolic analyzer. Main Outcome Measures: Heart rate, oxygen uptake, and energy expenditure. Results: Heart rate, oxygen uptake, and energy expenditure were considerably higher (P &lt; .05) during activity-promoting video game play compared with rest and sedentary video game play. The mean (SD) corresponding oxygen uptake values for the sedentary, dance, and boxing video games were 6.1(1.3), 12.8(3.3), and 17.7(5.1) mL·min -1·kg-1, respectively. Energy expenditures were 1.5 (0.3), 3.0(1.0), and 4.4(1.6) kcal·min-1, respectively. Conclusions: Dance Central and Kinect Sports Boxing increased energy expenditure by 150% and 263%, respectively, above resting values and were 103% and 194% higher than traditional video gaming. This equates to an increased energy expenditure of up to 172 kcal·h-1 compared with traditional sedentary video game play. Played regularly, active gaming using Kinect for the Xbox 360 could prove to be an effective means for increasing physical activity and energy expenditure in children. ©2012 American Medical Association.

,"Physiological Demands Of A Swimming-Based Video Game: Influence Of Gender, Swimming Background, And Exergame Experience","Active video games (exergames) may provide short-term increase in energy expenditure. We explored the effects of gender and prior experience on aerobic and anaerobic energy systems contributions, and the activity profiles of 40 participants playing with a swimming exergame. We recorded oxygen consumption and assessed blood lactate after each swimming technique. We also filmed participants' gameplays, divided them into different phases and tagged them as active or inactive. Anaerobic pathway accounted for 8.9 ± 5.6% of total energy expenditure and although experienced players were less active compared to novice counterparts (η2; &lt; 0.15, p &lt; 0.05), physiological measures were not different between performing groups. However, players with real-swimming experience during the first technique had higher heart rate (partial-η2 = 0.09, p &lt; 0.05). Our results suggest that short-term increase in physiological measures might happen in the beginning of gameplay because of unfamiliarity with the game mechanics. Despite low levels of activity compared to real sport, both aerobic and anaerobic energy systems should be considered in the evaluation of exergames. Game mechanics (involving the whole body) and strategies to minimize pragmatic play might be used for effective and meaningful game experience. © 2017 The Author(s).",doi,10.1038/s41598-017-05583-8,Scopus,Scientific Reports,"Soltani P., Figueiredo P., Ribeiro J., Fernandes R.J., Vilas-Boas J.P.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Physiological Indicators Of Pathologic Video Game Use In Adolescence,"Purpose Pathologic video game use (PVGU) has been associated with a host of negative psychological, physical, and social outcomes during adolescence; however, little research has examined physiological predictors of such use. The purpose of the study was to examine physiological predictors of the development of PVGU across adolescence. Methods The article involves a 1-year longitudinal study across midadolescence. Participants were 374 adolescents and their parents from a large metropolitan area in the Northwest United States. PVGU was assessed via questionnaire, as were a number of control variables. A number of physiological indicators including respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and galvanic skin conductance (indices of parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system activity, respectively) were measured during baseline, a cognitively stimulating task (Rubik's cube), and a family problem-solving task. Results Less RSA withdrawal to a cognitively simulating task was related to greater pathologic video game symptoms, but less RSA withdrawal to a family problem-solving task was associated with the presence of pathologic video game symptoms (p <.05). For girls only, galvanic skin conductance activation during the family problem solving was related to greater pathologic video game symptoms (p <.01). Conclusions These findings suggest that adolescents who do not find cognitive tasks stimulating physiologically have a greater severity of PVGU. Additionally, adolescents who show physiological signs of stress in a family task were more likely to have PVGU symptoms and only girls have more severe PVGU levels. This study is the first to show that physiological indicators predict PVGU over time in adolescence and has important implications regarding the prevention and treatment of PVGU in adolescence. © 2015 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.",doi,10.1016/j.jadohealth.2014.10.271,Scopus,Journal of Adolescent Health,"Coyne S.M., Dyer W.J., Densley R., Money N.M., Day R.D., Harper J.M.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Physiological Responses And Hedonics During Prolonged Physically Interactive Videogame Play,"Objective: This study was designed to assess physiologic responses and hedonics (i.e., liking) during prolonged physically interactive videogame play. Materials and Methods: Participants (n = 24) completed three 30-minute videogame conditions on separate days in a random order. During two of the conditions participants played physically interactive videogames (Nintendo of America, Inc. [Redmond, WA] ""Wii™ Fit"" ""Basic Run"" and ""Basic Step""). During the third condition participants played a traditional/sedentary game (""Tanks!""), which required minimal physical movement for gameplay. Oxygen consumption (VO2) was assessed using indirect calorimetry throughout each condition and averaged every 5 minutes. Liking was assessed via visual analog scale at the 15- and 30-minute time points during each condition. Results: Mean VO2 was significantly (P &lt; 0.001) greater during ""Basic Run"" (16.14 ± 5.8 mL/kg/minute, 4.6 ± 1.7 metabolic equivalents [METs]) than either ""Basic Step"" (11.4 ± 1.7 mL/kg/minute, 3.3 ± 0.5 METs) or the traditional/sedentary videogame (5.39 ± 1.0 mL/kg/minute, 1.5 ± 0.1 METs). ""Basic Step"" was also greater (P &lt; 0.001) than the traditional/sedentary game. VO2 did not significantly (P = 0.25) fluctuate across the 30-minute session for any game. In other words, participants maintained a consistent physiologic intensity throughout each 30-minute condition. There were no differences (P ≥ 0.20) across gaming conditions or time for liking. Conclusions: Participants achieved and maintained moderate-intensity physical activity (≥3.0 METs) during both 30-minute physically interactive videogame conditions. Furthermore, because liking was similar across all gaming conditions, participants may be willing to substitute the physically interactive videogames in place of the traditional/sedentary game. © Copyright 2016, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016.",doi,10.1089/g4h.2015.0077,Scopus,Games for Health Journal,"Santo A.S., Barkley J.E., Hafen P.S., Navalta J.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Plasma Norepinephrine Pharmacokinetics During Mental Challenge,"We simultaneously infused tracer-labeled norepinephrine (NE) and isoproterenol (ISO) intravenously into 14 subjects to measure forearm and total body NE pharmacokinetics at rest and in response to mental challenge (video game or cognitive task). Mental challenge was associated with significantly increased heart rate (24%), systolic blood pressure (13%), cardiac output (impedance cardiography, 9%), forearm blood flow (38%), and the rate of release of endogenous NE into arterial blood (total body NE spillover, 29%), but not with changes in antecubital venous NE. Responses of total NE spillover were directly related to changes in cardiac output (r = 0.68) and systolic blood pressure (r = 0.60), whereas those of antecubital venous NE were not. forearm extraction of NE was related inversely to forearm blood flow both at rest (r = -0.80) and during mental challenge (r = -0.81), and total body clearance of NE was positively related to cardiac output at rest (r = 0.78) and during mental challenge (r = 0.54). The results indicate that mental challenge is associated with generally increased sympathetically-mediated NE release that determines the hemodynamic responses. Because of regional changes in sympathetic activity and blood flow during psychological stress, changes in antecubital venous NE and even arterial NE may not reflect accurately sympathetic nerve activity. Measurements of total body and regional NE pharmacokinetics avoids these difficulties.",doi,10.1097/00006842-198711000-00004,Scopus,Psychosomatic Medicine,"Goldstein D.S., Eisenhofer G., Sax F.L., Keiser H.R., Kopin I.J.",1987,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Playing By The Rules: Parental Mediation Of Video Game Play,"This study examined parental mediation of children’s video game play in an Internet survey of 433 parents of children aged 5 to 18 years. We assessed the valence of active mediation (i.e., positive, negative, neutral) and the relationship between parental involvement and mediation techniques. Furthermore, we explored whether parental mediation was associated with child delinquency. Our results demonstrate that active mediation is generally negative or neutral in nature. Involved parents were more likely to use each mediation strategy than less involved parents; however, parental involvement did not predict negative mediation. Restrictive and negative mediation were significantly related to child delinquency. In sum, the findings show that parents are involved in monitoring their children’s use of this medium, just as they are with television. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.",doi,10.1177/0192513X15613822,Scopus,Journal of Family Issues,"Martins N., Matthews N.L., Ratan R.A.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas

,"Playing With Power: Power Poses Affect Enjoyment, Presence, Controller Responsiveness, And Arousal When Playing Natural Motion-Controlled Video Games","Though playing with natural versus traditional game controllers affects game experiences, studies have not investigated how power poses affect the experience of playing natural controlled video games. Participants keeping powerful poses experienced increased enjoyment, presence, and controller responsiveness compared with those holding powerless poses. Congruent with self-perception and automatic activation models, mediation analyses uncovered direct effects of power poses and also indirect effects in which power poses increased power feelings, which in turn were associated with higher enjoyment, presence, and controller responsiveness but reduced arousal. This provides initial evidence for how physical poses affect people's experiences with natural game interfaces, and highlight basic self-perception and automatic activation mechanisms behind the effect. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",doi,10.1016/j.chb.2017.02.019,Scopus,Computers in Human Behavior,"Peña J., Chen M.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Positional Demands Of Professional Rugby,"Rugby union is a physically intense intermittent sport coupled with high force collisions. Each position within a team has specific requirements which are typically based on speed, size and skill. The aim of this study was to investigate the contemporary demands of each position and whether they can explain changes in psychophysiological stress. Urine and saliva samples were collected before and after five selected Super 15 rugby games from 37 players. Total neopterin (NP), cortisol and immunoglobulin A were analysed by SCX-high performance liquid chromatography and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Global positioning system software provided distance data, while live video analysis provided impact data. All contemporary demands were analysed as events per minute of game time. Forwards were involved in more total impacts, tackles and rucks compared to backs (p < 0.001), while backs were involved in more ball carries and covered more total distance and distance at high speed per minute of game time (p < 0.01). Loose forwards, inside and outside backs covered significantly more distance at high speed (p < 0.01), while there was a negligible difference with number of impacts between the forward positions. There was also minimal difference between positions in the percentage change in NP, cortisol and sIgA. The results indicate distance covered and number of impacts per minute of game time is position-dependent whereas changes in psychophysiological stress are independent. This information can be used to adapt training and recovery interventions to better prepare each position based on the physical requirements of the game. © 2015 European College of Sport Science.",doi,10.1080/17461391.2015.1025858,Scopus,European Journal of Sport Science,"Lindsay A., Draper N., Lewis J., Gieseg S.P., Gill N.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Potassium Intake And Cardiovascular Reactivity In Children With Risk Factors For Essential Hypertension,"Objectives: Our study objectives were as follows: (1) to determine whether urinary excretion of potassium is lower in black than in white children, (2) to determine whether cardiovascular reactivity (CVR) varies inversely with dietary intake of potassium, and (3) to confirm that CVR is greater in black than in white children, and in children with a family history of hypertension than in those without such a history. Study design: Baseline measurements included 24-hour urinary sodium, potassium, and creatinine levels and food intake (by questionnaire). Resting and stress blood pressures were measured during blood sampling, cold water foot immersion, and a video game before and after 1 week each of supplementation with potassium citrate, 1.5 mmol/kg per day, and placebo administered in random order. Results: Thirty-nine children aged 7 to 15 years were studied. White subjects had higher baseline excretion of potassium than black subjects (p < 0.001) and higher vegetable intake (p < 0.01), which were positively correlated (r = 0.53, p < 0.001). At baseline, the 24-hour urinary potassium/creatinine ratio varied inversely with diastolic CVR to the video game stressor in white children (r = -0.55, p = 0.02). Cardiovascular reactivity was not attenuated measurably by potassium supplementation compared with placebo. The CVR was greater in children with a family history of hypertension than in those without, but was not greater in black children than in white children. Conclusions: The urinary potassium/creatinine ratio is higher in white than black children because their intake of vegetables is greater; dietary potassium intake may modulate CVR, particularly in white children with a family history of hypertension, but may need to be supplemented for more than 1 week to demonstrate attenuation of CVR; and a family history of hypertension may be a stronger predictor of enhanced CVR than is race.",doi,10.1016/S0022-3476(97)70129-X,Scopus,Journal of Pediatrics,"Sorof J.M., Forman A., Cole N., Jemerin J.M., Morris R.C.",1997,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,"Pre-Meal Screen-Time Activities Increase Subjective Emotions, But Not Food Intake In Young Girls","Purpose To determine the effect of pre-meal screen-time activities on subjective emotions, subjective appetite, and food intake (FI) in 9–14 year-old girls. Methods In this clinical study, 31 girls completed four 45-min treatment conditions of television viewing (TVV), video game playing (VGP), a challenging computer task (CT), and sitting without screen exposure (control) in a randomized order. Each treatment condition was followed immediately by an ad libitum pizza lunch, and FI was calculated from the weight of the consumed pizza. Subjective appetite was assessed at baseline, 15, 30, and 45 min during the treatment condition, and upon trial completion at 75 min. Subjective emotions were assessed at baseline and at 45 min. Results FI was not affected by screen type, but was positively correlated with body composition (fat mass [FM, kg], fat free mass [FFM, kg]) in all treatment conditions. Subjective appetite was not affected by screen type, but increased with time in all treatment conditions (p < 0.0001). Subjective emotions were affected by VGP only. Anger, excitement, frustration, and upset feelings were increased at 45 min following VGP. VGP led to increased frustration compared to control (p = 0.0003), CT (p = 0.007) and TVV (p = 0.0002). Conclusion Exposure to TVV or CT before eating did not affect subjective emotions, subjective appetite, or FI, and no difference was found between screen activities and the control condition for average appetite or FI. Despite a change in subjective emotions during the VGP condition, there was no increase in subjective appetite or subsequent FI. These findings suggest that physiologic signals of satiation and satiety are not overridden by environmental stimuli of pre-meal screen-time exposure among young girls.

,Predicting Human Interactive Learning By Regret-Driven Neural Networks,"Much of human learning in a social context has an interactive nature: What an individual learns is affected by what other individuals are learning at the same time. Games represent a widely accepted paradigm for representing interactive decision-making. We explored the potential value of neural networks for modeling and predicting human interactive learning in repeated games. We found that even very simple learning networks, driven by regret-based feedback, accurately predict observed human behavior in different experiments on 21 games with unique equilibria in mixed strategies.

,Predicting The Effect Of Interactive Video Bikes On Exercise Adherence: An Efficacy Trial,"Exercise games that employ video game technology are increasing in the marketplace but have received scant research attention despite their popularity. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of videobike gaming on the constructs of the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and adherence in comparison to a cycling condition where participants listen to self-selected music. Participants were 29 inactive young men assigned randomly to experimental (n=16) or comparison (n=13) conditions. The recommended training regime consisted of moderate intensity activity (60-75% heart rate reserve), 3 days/week for 30min/day for 6 weeks. At the end of the first session, participants were asked to complete TPB measures and these were subsequently measured 6 weeks later. Attendance was used as the measure of adherence. Results showed that affective attitude and adherence across the 6 weeks significantly favored the videobike condition over the comparison condition. Regression analyses suggested partial mediation of the effect of the videobike condition on adherence via affective attitude. This is the first study to provide evidence that interactive videobikes may improve adherence over traditional cycling because the activity produces higher affective attitudes. The results are promising for expanding to community-based evaluation.",doi,10.1080/13548500903281088,Scopus,"Psychology, Health and Medicine","Rhodes R.E., Warburton D.E.R., Bredin S.S.D.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Presence And Emotions In Playing A Group Game In A Virtual Environment: The Influence Of Body Participation,"This study assesses the influence of body participation on the sense of presence and emotions, and the relationship between the two dependent variables in playing a group game in a virtual environment. A total of 56 volunteers were asked to play a virtual game in a 360-degree stereoscopic immersive interactive visualization environment using either body movement or a joystick. Presence was measured with the post hoc SUS Presence Questionnaire. The pictorial tool of Self-Assessment Manikin was employed for measuring emotions of arousal and valence. Both arousal and valence positively correlated with presence. However, body participation did not significantly affect reported presence or the above-mentioned emotions.

,Probabilistic Pursuit-Evasion Games: A One-Step Nash Approach,"This paper addresses the control of a team of autonomous agents pursuing a smart evader in a non-accurately mapped terrain. By describing the problem as a partial information Markov game, we are able to integrate map-learning and pursuit. We propose receding horizon control policies, in which the pursuers and the evader try to respectively maximize and minimize the probability of capture at the next time instant. Because this probability is conditioned to distinct observations for each team, the resulting game is nonzero-sum. When the evader has access to the pursuers' information, we show that a Nash solution to the one-step nonzero-sum game always exists. Moreover, we propose a method to compute the Nash equilibrium policies by solving an equivalent zero-sum matrix game. A simulation example shows the feasibility of the proposed approach.",doi,10.1109/CDC.2000.914136,Scopus,Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Decision and Control,"Hespanha J.P., Prandini M., Sastry S.",2e3,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Protection Motivation Theory And Social Distancing Behaviour In Response To A Simulated Infectious Disease Epidemic,"Epidemics of respiratory infectious disease remain one of the most serious health risks facing the population. Non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g. hand-washing or wearing face masks) can have a significant impact on the course of an infectious disease epidemic. The current study investigated whether protection motivation theory (PMT) is a useful framework for understanding social distancing behaviour (i.e. the tendency to reduce social contacts) in response to a simulated infectious disease epidemic. There were 230 participants (109 males, 121 females, mean age 32.4 years) from the general population who completed self-report measures assessing the components of PMT. In addition, participants completed a computer game which simulated an infectious disease epidemic in order to provide a measure of social distancing behaviour. The regression analyses revealed that none of the PMT variables were significant predictors of social distancing behaviour during the simulation task. However, fear (β =.218, p <.001), response efficacy (β =.175, p <.01) and self-efficacy (β =.251, p <.001) were all significant predictors of intention to engage in social distancing behaviour. Overall, the PMT variables (and demographic factors) explain 21.2% of the variance in intention. The findings demonstrated that PMT was a useful framework for understanding intention to engage in social distancing behaviour, but not actual behaviour during the simulated epidemic. These findings may reflect an intention-behaviour gap in relation to social distancing behaviour. © 2015 Taylor and Francis.",doi,10.1080/13548506.2015.1028946,Scopus,"Psychology, Health and Medicine","Williams L., Rasmussen S., Kleczkowski A., Maharaj S., Cairns N.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Psychophysiological Responses To Background Brand Placements In Video Games,"Researchers have typically employed cognitive and affective measures to study the effectiveness of brand placements in video games. A psychophysiological approach to measuring effectiveness has been sorely lacking and is necessary to help both academics and practitioners further their understanding of how brand placements work. The current study measures individuals orienting responses in terms of increased skin conductance and decreased heart rate upon exposure to brands in video games. Results indicate that game players register background advertisements subconsciously even though they may not be able to explicitly recall them later. There were no differences between gamers and nongamers in the recall and recognition of brands from the video game. Furthermore, brands with preexisting favorable attitudes automatically received further processing, suggesting orienting response is an indicator of initial perception rather than further elaboration. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",doi,10.1080/00913367.2013.775800,Scopus,Journal of Advertising,"Gangadharbatla H., Bradley S., Wise W.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Psychosocial Factors Affecting Psychosomatic Symptoms In Japanese Schoolchildren,"Background: In a previous study we reported the prevalence of psychosomatic symptoms in 1619 Osaka elementary schoolchildren using our original general health questionnaire assessed by their parents. We found that psychosomatic symptoms were increasing with age. This study was designed to investigate psychosocial factors responsible for increasing psychosomatic symptoms with age. Methods: We calculated a correlation coefficient between the physical complaints score (PCS) and these psychosocial variables using quantitation I of multiple regression analysis separately in the older (10-12 years, n = 860) and the younger age group (7-9 years, n = 759). Results: A stronger relationship between PCS and psychosocial problems was found in the older (r = 0.719, P < 0.0001) than in the younger age group (r=0.570, P < 0.0001). Further analysis demonstrated that difficulties in school performance and increasing psychological conflicts with human relationships were major causes of somatic complaints in the older age group. In the younger age group, however, immaturity of social skills seems to be a primary problem. In addition, poor parental interaction and the playing of computer games were found to increase somatic complaints in children. Conclusion: Children in the older age reflect the closer bio-psycho-socio interaction compared with their younger counterparts. This may give rise to a high incidence of psychosomatic disorders and school refusal in Japanese children. We emphasize that psychological support by parents in daily life is necessary to reduce psychosomatic symptoms in children.",doi,10.1046/j.1442-200X.2000.01243.x,Scopus,Pediatrics International,"Tanaka H., Tamai H., Terashima S., Takenaka Y., Tanaka T.",2e3,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Pulse-Driven Magnetoimpedance Sensor Detection Of Cardiac Magnetic Activity,"This study sought to establish a convenient method for detecting biomagnetic activity in the heart. Electrical activity of the heart simultaneously induces a magnetic field. Detection of this magnetic activity will enable non-contact, noninvasive evaluation to be made. We improved the sensitivity of a pulse-driven magnetoimpedance (PMI) sensor, which is used as an electric compass in mobile phones and as a motion sensor of the operation handle in computer games, toward a pico-Tesla (pT) level, and measured magnetic fields on the surface of the thoracic wall in humans. The changes in magnetic field detected by this sensor synchronized with the electric activity of the electrocardiogram (ECG). The shape of the magnetic wave was largely altered by shifting the sensor position within 20 mm in parallel and/or perpendicular to the thoracic wall. The magnetic activity was maximal in the 4th intercostals near the center of the sterna. Furthermore, averaging the magnetic activity at 15 mm in the distance between the thoracic wall and the sensor demonstrated magnetic waves mimicking the P wave and QRS complex. The present study shows the application of PMI sensor in detecting cardiac magnetic activity in several healthy subjects, and suggests future applications of this technology in medicine and biology. © 2011 Nakayama et al.",doi,10.1371/journal.pone.0025834,Scopus,PLoS ONE,"Nakayama S., Sawamura K., Mohri K., Uchiyama T.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Quantifying Head Impact Exposure In Collegiate Women's Soccer,"Objective: The aim of this study was to quantify head impact exposure for a collegiate women's soccer team over the course of the 2014 season. Design: Observational and prospective study. Setting: Virginia Tech women's soccer games and practices. Participants: Twenty-six collegiate level women's soccer players with a mean player age of 19 ± 1. Interventions: Participating players were instrumented with head impact sensors for biomechanical analysis. Video recordings of each event were used to manually verify each impact sustained. Main Outcome Measures: Head impact counts by player position and impact situation. Results: The sensors collected data from a total of 17 865 accelerative events, 8999 of which were classified as head impacts. Of these, a total of 1703 impacts were positively identified (19% of total real impacts recorded by sensor), 90% of which were associated with heading the ball. The average number of impacts per player per practice or game was 1.86 ± 1.42. Exposure to head impact varied by player position. Conclusions: Head impact exposure was quantified through 2 different methods, which illustrated the challenges associated with autonomously collecting acceleration data with head impact sensors. Users of head impact data must exercise caution when interpreting on-field head impact sensor data. © 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.",doi,10.1097/JSM.0000000000000313,Scopus,Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine,"Press J.N., Rowson S.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Raising Perceptual Awareness Of The Fe Teacher: A Teaching Appraisal Technique,"It is a matter of some importance for institutions of further and higher education to investigate ways of improving teaching effectiveness. Many studies have been undertaken in both Europe and elsewhere. These have, in general, been published in the academic journals and a number of conferences have been held to discuss the techniques proposed. Almost without exception, the proposals which have been considered rely on behaviourally orientated methodologies akin to the many techniques currently in use in the USA (and in other countries where teaching assessment is common practice). It has been the author’s contention that such techniques are an inappropriate way of improving teaching effectiveness as they demand a pre-specification of criteria deemed to be appropriate, the teacher is then assessed against this ‘ideal profile’. It is the author’s view that the teacher should be perceived as a professional, capable of undertaking his task with autonomy. This is particularly valuable if a mechanism exists to assist him in identifying his strengths and weaknesses so that he can capitalise on the former whilst endeavouring to eradicate the latter (through the application of appropriate staff development). Thus, in 1975, as part of a doctoral research project, the author devised a teaching appraisal system which became know as TARGET. TARGET is an acronym for Teaching Appraisal by Repertory Grid Elicitation Techniques and is based on the principles of Personal Construct Psychology. The primary objective when using the TARGET system is to raise the perceptual awareness of the teacher to his strengths and weaknesses, this, in turn, may enable him to become more effective at this job. However, the system remains far less threatening than those aforementioned behavioural techniques. Since 1975, the author has continued his research and whilst TARGET has been, and is still, used in a number of institutions of further and higher education in the UK, USA, Australia and even India, the methodology developed has been refined and improved over the intervening period. Consequently, the technique now proposed by the author as the most efficient way of raising perceptual awareness (and thus achieving the same goals as the TARGET system), is to encourage individual lecturers to sit in front of a small microprocessor and interact with a programme, (designed using the same principles of Personal Construct Psychology), such that feedback can be given immediately in terms of his strengths and weaknesses. This paper briefly considers the TARGET system as it was devised, the interactive computer programme as it is currently used at Garnett College, (and some other institutions in Europe and Australia) and finally, illustrates the principles underlying both the TARGET and interactive computer programme by describing the game of MISUNDERSTOOD, which can be played without the hardwear support, of the video or computing kind, necessary in both the former methods. MISUNDERSTOOD can be played in groups of three or four (with a number of groups playing simultaneously) as a one-off staff development exercise. It has already been successfully used by an international motor company, a number of educational institutions and the Prison Education Officers Training Scheme. The author contends therefore, that raising perceptual awareness by any of the three methods described in this paper makes a positive and worthwhile contribution to the improvement of the effectiveness of the FE teacher, and supports this with evidence drawn from his experience of applying the techniques in a number of institutions in which he has been employed and had some responsibility for Staff Development. © 1981, The Vocational Aspect of Education Ltd.",doi,10.1080/10408347308001561,Scopus,Vocational Aspect of Education,Keen T.R.,1981,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas

,Rehabilitation Following Cerebral Anoxia: An Assessment Of 27 Patients,"Objectives: (1) To evaluate cognitive and emotional impairments, disability and quality-of-life for adults with cerebral anoxia institutionalized in residential care facilities. (2) To evaluate the efficacy of medication, psychotherapy, support group and therapeutic activities.Methods: Twenty-seven persons with cerebral anoxia were recruited, on average 8 years post-injury. Only 20 went through the whole study. Over three consecutive 2-month periods, they were assessed four times to evaluate: baseline observations (T1-T2), adjustment of their medication (T2-T3); and the effect of psychotherapy, support group and therapeutic activities such as physical and artistic or cultural activities usually proposed in the facilities involved (T3-T4). Examined variables at all time points were cognitive status, anxiety and depression, anosognosia, alexithymia, disability and quality-of-life.Results: All participants exhibited cognitive and emotional impairments comparable to those reported in the literature. Statistical analyses revealed good baseline stability of their condition and no significant effects of changes in medication (between T2 and T3). Conversely, following implementation of psychotherapy, support group and therapeutic activities (between T3 and T4), quality-of-life and social participation were significantly improved.Conclusion: Social participation and quality-of-life for persons instutionalized several years after cerebral anoxia were improved by psychotherapeutic and therapeutic activities. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",doi,10.3109/02699052.2015.1113563,Scopus,Brain Injury,"Tazopoulou E., Miljkovitch R., Truelle J.-L., Schnitzler A., Onillon M., Zucco T., Hawthorne G., Montreuil M.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Relation Of Self-Rated Measures Of Physical Activity To Multiple Risk Factors Of Insulin Resistance Syndrome In Young Adults: The Bogalusa Heart Study,"The relation of self-rated measures of physical activity to multiple risk factors of insulin resistance syndrome (IRS) was examined in African American (n = 409) and white (n = 1,011) young adults aged 20 to 38 years enrolled in the Bogalusa Heart Study. Physical activity was assessed in terms of work activity, leisure-time activity, television watching, and video game playing by a questionnaire. Waist circumference, blood pressure, total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio, and insulin resistance index showed a consistent inverse trend with leisure-time activity (P < 0.01) and a positive trend with hours of inactivity (P < 0.01) after adjusting for age, race, and sex. An inverse relationship was seen between leisure-time activity and mean number of risk factors (>75th percentile for age, race, and sex) (P < 0.001), whereas a positive relationship was seen with hours of inactivity (P < 0.001). Moderately to very active individuals versus inactive individuals had a reduced relative risk of having ≥3 risk factors (P < 0.05); conversely, excess hours of inactivity increased the relative risk (P < 0.05). Thus, leisure-time activity and hours of inactivity are important predictors of multiple cardiovascular risk variables of IRS in young adults. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

,Relationship Between Screen Time And Metabolic Syndrome In Adolescents,"Background: The primary objective was to determine the dose-response relation between screen time (television + computer) and the metabolic syndrome (MetS) in adolescents. Methods: The study sample included 1803 adolescents (12-19 years) from the 1999-04 US National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. Average daily screen time (combined television, computer and video game use) was self-reported. MetS was defined according to adolescent criteria linked to the adult criteria of the National Cholesterol Education Program (≥3 of high triglycerides, high fasting glucose, high waist circumference, high blood pressure and low HDL cholesterol). Results: After adjustment for relevant covariates, the odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for MetS increased in a dose-response manner (Ptrend &lt; 0.01) across ≤1 h/day (1.00, referent), 2 h/day (1.21, 0.54-2.73), 3 h/day (2.16, 0.99-4.74), 4 h/day (1.73, 0.72-4.17) and ≥5 h/day (3.07, 1.48-6.34) screen time categories. Physical activity had a minimal impact on the relation between screen time and MetS. Conclusions: Screen time was associated with an increased likelihood of MetS in a dose-dependent manner independent of physical activity. These findings suggest that lifestyle-based public health interventions for youth should include a specific component aimed at reducing screen time. © The Author 2008, Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Faculty of Public Health.

,Resilient Help To Switch And Overlap Hierarchical Subsystems In A Small Human Group,"Groups of social organisms in nature are resilient systems that can overcome unpredicted threats by helping its members. These social organisms are assumed to behave both autonomously and cooperatively as individuals, the helper, the helped and other part of a group depending on the context such as emergencies. However, the structure and function of these resilient actions, such as how helpers help colleagues and how the helper's action is effective at multiple subsystem scales remain unclear. Here we investigated the behaviour of organised and efficient small human groups in a ballgame defence, and identified three principles of hierarchical resilient help when under attack. First, at a present high emergency level, the helper simply switched the local roles in the attacked subsystem with the helped. Second, at an intermediate emergency level, the helpers effectively acted in overlapping subsystems. Third, for the most critical emergency, the helpers globally switched the action on the overall system. These resilient actions to the benefit of the system were assumed to be observed in only humans, which help colleagues at flexibly switched and overlapped hierarchical subsystem. We suggest that these multi-layered helping behaviours can help to understand resilient cooperation in social organisms and human groups.",doi,10.1038/srep23911,Scopus,Scientific Reports,"Fujii K., Yokoyama K., Koyama T., Rikukawa A., Yamada H., Yamamoto Y.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Respiratory Effects On Experimental Heat Pain And Cardiac Activity,"Objective. Slow deep breathing has been proposed as an effective method to decrease pain. However, experimental studies conducted to validate this claim have not been carried out. Design. We measured thermal pain threshold and tolerance scores from 20 healthy adults during five different conditions, namely, during natural breathing (baseline), slow deep breathing (6 breaths/minute), rapid breathing (16 breaths/minute), distraction (video game), and heart rate (HR) biofeedback. We measured respiration (rate and depth) and HR variability from the electrocardiogram (ECG) output and analyzed the effects of respiration on pain and HR variability using time and frequency domain measures of the ECG. Results. Compared with baseline, thermal pain threshold was significantly higher during slow deep breathing (P = 0.002), HR biofeedback (P < 0.001), and distraction (P = 0.006), whereas thermal pain tolerance was significantly higher during slow deep breathing (P = 0.003) and HR biofeedback (P < 0.001). Compared with baseline, only slow deep breathing and HR biofeedback conditions had an effect on cardiac activity. These conditions increased the amplitude of vagal cardiac markers (peak-to-valley, P < 0.001) as well as low frequency power (P < 0.001). Conclusion. Slow deep breathing and HR biofeedback had analgesic effects and increased vagal cardiac activity. Distraction also produced analgesia; however, these effects were not accompanied by concomitant changes in cardiac activity. This suggests that the neurobiology underlying respiratory-induced analgesia and distraction are different. Clinical implications are discussed, as are the possible cardiorespiratory processes responsible for mediating breathing-induced analgesia. © American Academy of Pain Medicine.",doi,10.1111/j.1526-4637.2009.00681.x,Scopus,Pain Medicine,"Chalaye P., Goffaux P., Lafrenaye S., Marchand S.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Role Of Virtual Reality For Cerebral Palsy Management.,"Virtual reality is the use of interactive simulations to present users with opportunities to perform in virtual environments that appear, sound, and less frequently, feel similar to real-world objects and events. Interactive computer play refers to the use of a game where a child interacts and plays with virtual objects in a computer-generated environment. Because of their distinctive attributes that provide ecologically realistic and motivating opportunities for active learning, these technologies have been used in pediatric rehabilitation over the past 15 years. The ability of virtual reality to create opportunities for active repetitive motor/sensory practice adds to their potential for neuroplasticity and learning in individuals with neurologic disorders.

,Self-Emergence Of A Common Lexicon By Evolution In Teams Of Autonomous Agents,"In multi-agent systems, the study of language and communication is an active field of research. In this paper we present the application of evolutionary strategies to the self-emergence of a common lexicon in a population of agents. By modeling the vocabulary or lexicon of each agent as an association matrix or look-up table that maps the meanings (i.e. the objects encountered by the agents or the states of the environment itself) into symbols or signals we check whether it is possible for the population to converge in an autonomous, decentralized way to a common lexicon, so that the communication efficiency of the entire population is optimal. We have conducted several experiments aimed at testing whether it is possible to converge with evolutionary strategies to an optimal Saussurean communication system. We have organized our experiments alongside two main lines: first, we have investigated the effect of the population size on the convergence results. Second, and foremost, we have also investigated the effect of the lexicon size on the convergence results. To analyze the convergence of the population of agents we have defined the population's consensus when all the agents (i.e. 100% of the population) share the same association matrix or lexicon. As a general conclusion we have shown that evolutionary strategies are powerful enough optimizers to guarantee the convergence to lexicon consensus in a population of autonomous agents. © 2011 Elsevier B.V..",doi,10.1016/j.neucom.2011.01.026,Scopus,Neurocomputing,"Maravall D., De Lope J., Domínguez R.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Sensory Realism And Mediated Aggression In Video Games,"This study investigated whether sensory realism cues in violent games - blood color (red vs. blue), screams of pain (on vs. off), and player perspective (first-person vs. third-person) - affect players' physiological arousal (i.e.; skin conductance levels), spatial presence (i.e.; sense of being physically ""there""), and state aggression in a popular violent game (Half-Life 2), controlling for users' prior game experiences. A path model (N = 160) was examined to see the mediation effects of arousal and presence between realism cues and state aggression. In line with the general aggression model, results showed that realistic blood color and screams increased arousal, but no effect was found for first-person perspective. Presence significantly affected users' state aggression. However, contrary to our expectation based on the excitation transfer theory, arousal did not show any significant effect on aggression. In addition, presence mediated the influence of realistic blood color on state aggression. In the effects of graphic realism of violence on user aggression, presence did a crucial role. Implications and future studies were discussed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

,Serious Games Continuum: Between Games For Purpose And Experiential Environments For Purpose,"While many categorizations and definitions have attempted to elucidate the elusive term serious games, we are still some way off formulating an agreed understanding of what serious games are and can be. This article argues that the term serious games challenges our understanding of generally accepted characteristics such as, challenge, play and fun, which are largely associated with and borrowed from video games. It is argued that key to understanding what serious games encapsulate is to look beyond these characteristics. This article proposes a definition and way to frame serious games technologies, applications and environments along a continuum of gaming characteristics or gameness. From those with traditional gaming activities and characteristics (challenge, play, fun, etc.) at one end to those with minimal traditional gaming characteristics at the other end, whose main purpose is to provide experience and emotion to convey meaning. The main advantages of the definition and continuum are to establish a shared understanding and arena for current and emerging serious games, frame and connect currently fragmented groups into a cohesive serious games movement and community and open opportunities for future collaborative research and development. In addition, it helps in identifying characteristics for the design and assessment of serious games. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",doi,10.1016/j.entcom.2010.12.004,Scopus,Entertainment Computing,Marsh T.,2011,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Setting The Scene: Playing Digital Director In Interactive Storytelling And Creation,"Interactive digital storytelling promises to be a new artistic discipline. But what does the artwork look like? And how much control does the artist have over the final result? By searching for the right answers, we draw several approaches from diverse fields such as filmmaking, game design, autonomous agents, psychology, and narrative intelligence. We first give a definition of interactive storytelling that includes a scope between authorship and emergent narrative, and present two example projects with different emphases. Then, we introduce a multi-level concept for an experimental stage that can be used to explore interactive storytelling at varying degrees of flexibility versus predetermination. Instead of inventing the ultimate virtual narrator, we suggest developing layers of run-time engines that allow authors to work with directions on each single layer separately - from selecting high-level dramatic structures down to directing animated actors. The concept of underlying models at each level is explained in detail by the example of a story model implementation. Further, we show variations of level adjustments causing graded degrees of semi-autonomy. First results of this experimental stage are presented, and the primary future tasks are pointed out. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.",doi,10.1016/S0097-8493(01)00176-5,Scopus,Computers and Graphics (Pergamon),"Spierling U., Grasbon D., Braun N., Iurgel I.",2002,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Sex Differences In Interpersonal Conflict,"An experiment is described that compares and contrasts male and female behavior in response to various forms of threats that previous research had indicated elicited different perceptual and behavioral reactions. A fairly complex decision-making internation simulation game was employed in a computer-controlled laboratory. The results indicate that deterrent threats are somewhat more likely to result in compliance than are compellent threats. Further, there were no gross differences between male and female response patterns. It was found, however, that males are somewhat more likely to comply to a threat. But, of the noncompliers males are more likely to behave aggressively and attack the other. Evidence is presented that indicates that females respond to an emotion-evoking hostile situation by passively resisting or withdrawing. © 1972, The Psychonomic Society, Inc..

,Short Review On Quantum Key Distribution Protocols.,"Cryptographic protocols and mechanisms are widely investigated under the notion of quantum computing. Quantum cryptography offers particular advantages over classical ones, whereas in some cases established protocols have to be revisited in order to maintain their functionality. The purpose of this paper is to provide the basic definitions and review the most important theoretical advancements concerning the BB84 and E91 protocols. It also aims to offer a summary on some key developments on the field of quantum key distribution, closely related with the two aforementioned protocols. The main goal of this study is to provide the necessary background information along with a thorough review on the theoretical aspects of QKD, concentrating on specific protocols. The BB84 and E91 protocols have been chosen because most other protocols are similar to these, a fact that makes them important for the general understanding of how the QKD mechanism functions.",doi,10.1007/978-3-319-56246-9_12,pubmed,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,"Giampouris, Dimitris",2017,NA,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Social Context And Video Game Play: Impact On Cardiovascular And Affective Responses,"We examined if cardiovascular and affective responding to video game play changed across social context or with game content. Male participants (13-22 years old) played a violent or nonviolent video game. Each participant played the game individually, competitively against a male partner, and cooperatively with the partner. There was no effect of social condition on heart rate (HR) or diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Participants had significantly higher systolic BP (SBP) when playing individually and competitively than when playing cooperatively, probably because play was more continuous. There was no impact of game type for HR or SBP. DBP was significantly higher for participants who played the violent game, perhaps because participants found the violent game more exciting and enjoyable. Participants who played the violent game rated the experimenters more positively than those who played the nonviolent game. Participants found game play more exciting, enjoyable, stressful, and frustrating, but less boring and relaxing, when they played competitively or cooperatively than when they played individually. The results are discussed in terms of the general aggression model. © 2012 Copyright Mass Communication & Society Division of the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication.",doi,10.1080/15205436.2011.632106,Scopus,Mass Communication and Society,"Ballard M., Visser K., Jocoy K.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Social Economic Decision-Making Across The Lifespan: An Fmri Investigation,"Recent research in neuroeconomics suggests that social economic decision-making may be best understood as a dual-systems process, integrating the influence of deliberative and affective subsystems. However, most of this research has focused on young adults and it remains unclear whether our current models extend to healthy aging. To address this question, we investigated the behavioral and neural basis of simple economic decisions in 18 young and 20 older healthy adults. Participants made decisions which involved accepting or rejecting monetary offers from human and non-human (computer) partners in an Ultimatum Game, while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The partners' proposals involved splitting an amount of money between the two players, and ranged from $1 to $5 (from a $10 pot). Relative to young adults, older participants expected more equitable offers and rejected moderately unfair offers ($3) to a larger extent. Imaging results revealed that, relative to young participants, older adults had higher activations in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) when receiving unfair offers ($1-$3). Age group moderated the relationship between left DLPFC activation and acceptance rates of unfair offers. In contrast, older adults showed lower activation of bilateral anterior insula in response to unfair offers. No age group difference was observed when participants received fair ($5) offers. These findings suggest that healthy aging may be associated with a stronger reliance on computational areas subserving goal maintenance and rule shifting (DLPFC) during interactive economic decision-making. Consistent with a well-documented "" positivity effect"" , older age may also decrease recruitment of areas involved in emotion processing and integration (anterior insula) in the face of social norm violation. © 2012.",doi,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2012.02.026,Scopus,Neuropsychologia,"Harlé Katia M.

,Social Equality In The Number Of Choice Options Is Represented In The Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex,"A distinct aspect of the sense of fairness in humans is that we care not only about equality in material rewards but also about equality in nonmaterial values. One such value is the opportunity to choose freely among many options, often regarded as a fundamental right to economic freedom. In modern developed societies, equal opportunities in work, living, and lifestyle are enforced by antidiscrimination laws. Despite the widespread endorsement of equal opportunity, no studies have explored how people assign value to it. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify the neural substrates for subjective valuation of equality in choice opportunity. Participants performed a two-person choice task in which the number of choices available was varied across trials independently of choice outcomes. By using this procedure, we manipulated the degree of equality in choice opportunity between players and dissociated it from the value of reward outcomes and their equality. We found that activation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) tracked the degree to which the number of options between the two players was equal. In contrast, activation in the ventral striatum tracked the number of options available to participants themselves but not the equality between players. Our results demonstrate that the vmPFC, a key brain region previously implicated in the processing of social values, is also involved in valuation of equality in choice opportunity between individuals. These findings may provide valuable insight into the human ability to value equal opportunity, a characteristic long emphasized in politics, economics, and philosophy. © 2014 the authors.",doi,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4427-13.2014,Scopus,Journal of Neuroscience,"Aoki R., Matsumoto M., Yomogida Y., Izuma K., Murayama K., Sugiura A., Camerer C.F., Adolphs R., Matsumoto K.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Sociocultural Games For Training And Analysis,"This paper presents a theory for role-playing simulation games intended to support analysts (and trainees) with generating and testing alternative competing hypotheses on how to influence world conflict situations. Simulated leaders and followers capable of playing these games are implemented in a cognitive modeling framework, called the Performance Moderator Function Server (PMFserv), which covers value systems, personality and cultural factors, emotions, relationships, perception, stress/coping style, and decision making. Of direct interest, as I-A explains, is codification and synthesis of best-of-breed social-science models within PMFserv to improve the internal validity of agent implementations. II and III present this for leader profiling instruments and group-membership decision making, respectively. IV then offers two real-world case studies (The Third Crusade and SE Asia Today) where agent models are subjected to Turing and correspondence tests under each case study. In sum, substantial effort on game realism, best-of-breed social-science models, and agent validation efforts is essential if analysis and training tools are to help explore cultural issues and alternative ways to influence outcomes. Such exercises, in turn, are likely to improve the state of the science as well. © 2007 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TSMCA.2007.906574,Scopus,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Part A:Systems and Humans","Silverman B.G., Bharathy G., Johns M., Eidelson R.J., Smith T.E., Nye B.",2007,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas

,Sound For Fantasy And Freedom,"Sound is an integral part of our everyday lives. Sound tells us about physical events in the environment, and we use our voices to share ideas and emotions through sound. When navigating the world on a day-to-day basis, most of us use a balanced mix of stimuli from our eyes, ears and other senses to get along. We do this totally naturally and without effort. In the design of computer game experiences, traditionally, most attention has been given to vision rather than the balanced mix of stimuli from our eyes, ears and other senses most of us use to navigate the world on a day to day basis. The risk is that this emphasis neglects types of interaction with the game needed to create an immersive experience. This chapter summarizes the relationship between sound properties, GameFlow and immersive experience and discusses two projects in which Interactive Institute, Sonic Studio has balanced perceptual stimuli and game mechanics to inspire and create new game concepts that liberate users and their imagination. © 2011, IGI Global.",doi,10.4018/978-1-61692-828-5.ch002,Scopus,Game Sound Technology and Player Interaction: Concepts and Developments,Liljedahl M.,2010,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer1,Andreas

,"State, Not Trait, Neuroendocrine Function Predicts Costly Reactive Aggression In Men After Social Exclusion And Inclusion","Social exclusion increases aggressive behaviour, and the possible neuroendocrine underpinnings of the effect are largely unknown. Here, we examined the extent to which testosterone and cortisol responses to social exclusion would predict subsequent reactive aggression. Men were randomly assigned to a social exclusion (SE) or inclusion (SI) condition of 'Cyberball', a computer ball-toss game. Aggression was then measured using the Point Subtraction Aggression Paradigm (PSAP). Saliva was collected at three points for the measurement of testosterone and cortisol. Regression analyses indicated that testosterone concentrations 10-min into the PSAP (controlling for pre- and post-Cyberball testosterone) were positively correlated with aggressive behaviour, irrespective of SI/SE. Post hoc analyses for the conditions separately, however, suggested the relationship was stronger for SI men (R2 change=13.3%, F1, 29=5.28, p=0.03) than for SE men (R2 change=1.8%, F1, 26=0.49, p=0.49). Aggressive behaviour was also positively correlated with cortisol concentrations 10-min into the PSAP (controlling for pre- and post-Cyberball cortisol) irrespective of SE/SI. When both hormones were included in the regression model, the interaction of baseline 'Cortisol'×'Testosterone'×'Experimental Group' approached significance (R2 change=5.4%, F1, 55=3.53, p=0.07), but no significant effects were observed in either group alone. The findings add to evidence that individual differences in state neuroendocrine function map onto variability in human social behaviour. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",doi,10.1016/j.biopsycho.2011.02.020,Scopus,Biological Psychology,"Geniole S.N., Carré J.M., McCormick C.M.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Strategies For Repeated Games With Subsystem Takeovers Implementable By Deterministic And Self-Stabilising Automata,"Systems of selfish-computers are subject to transient faults due to temporal malfunctions; just as the society is subjected to human mistakes. Game theory uses punishment for deterring improper behaviour. Due to faults, selfish-computers may punish well-behaved ones. This is one of the key motivations for forgiveness that follows any effective and credible punishment. Therefore, unplanned punishments must provably cease in order to avoid infinite cycles of unsynchronised behaviour of 'tit for tat'. We investigate another aspect of these systems. We consider the possibility of subsystem takeover. The takeover may lead to joint deviations coordinated by an arbitrary selfish-computer that controls an unknown group of subordinate computers. We present strategies that deter the coordinator from deviating in infinitely repeated games. We construct deterministic automata that implement these strategies with optimal complexity. Moreover, we prove that all unplanned punishments eventually cease by showing that the automata can recover from transient faults.

,Striatal Connectivity Changes Following Gambling Wins And Near-Misses: Associations With Gambling Severity,"Frontostriatal circuitry is implicated in the cognitive distortions associated with gambling behaviour. 'Near-miss' events, where unsuccessful outcomes are proximal to a jackpot win, recruit overlapping neural circuitry with actual monetary wins. Personal control over a gamble (e.g., via choice) is also known to increase confidence in one's chances of winning (the 'illusion of control'). Using psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses, we examined changes in functional connectivity as regular gamblers and non-gambling participants played a slot-machine game that delivered wins, near-misses and full-misses, and manipulated personal control. We focussed on connectivity with striatal seed regions, and associations with gambling severity, using voxel-wise regression. For the interaction term of near-misses (versus full-misses) by personal choice (participant-chosen versus computer-chosen), ventral striatal connectivity with the insula, bilaterally, was positively correlated with gambling severity. In addition, some effects for the contrast of wins compared to all non-wins were observed at an uncorrected (p <.001) threshold: there was an overall increase in connectivity between the striatal seeds and left orbitofrontal cortex and posterior insula, and a negative correlation for gambling severity with the connectivity between the right ventral striatal seed and left anterior cingulate cortex. These findings corroborate the 'non-categorical' nature of reward processing in gambling: near-misses and full-misses are objectively identical outcomes that are processed differentially. Ventral striatal connectivity with the insula correlated positively with gambling severity in the illusion of control contrast, which could be a risk factor for the cognitive distortions and loss-chasing that are characteristic of problem gambling. © 2014 The Authors.

,Superior 'Theory Of Mind' In Borderline Personality Disorder: An Analysis Of Interaction Behavior In A Virtual Trust Game,"To gain further insight into interpersonal dysfunction in Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) we investigated the effects of emotional cues and the fairness of a social partner on the ability to infer other peoples' intentions in a virtual social exchange. 30 BPD patients and 30 nonpatients were asked to play a multiround trust game with four virtual trustees. The trustees varied in regard to fairness and presence of emotional facial cues which were both linked to repayment ratio. BPD patients adjusted their investment to the fairness of their partner. In contrast, nonpatients disregarded the trustees' fairness in the presence of emotional facial expressions. Both groups performed equally in an emotion recognition task and assessed the trustees' fairness comparably. When the unfair trustee provided emotional cues, BPD patients assessed their own behavior as more fair, while the lack of cues led patients to assess their own behavior as unfair. BPD patients are superior in the attribution of mental states to interaction partners when emotional cues are present. While the emotional expressions of a partner dominated the exchange behavior in nonpatients, BPD patients used the objective fairness of their social counterparts to guide their own behavior despite the existence of emotional cues. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.psychres.2010.11.012,Scopus,Psychiatry Research,"Franzen N., Hagenhoff M., Baer N., Schmidt A., Mier D., Sammer G., Gallhofer B., Kirsch P., Lis S.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Support For The Predictive Validity Of The Sasc-R: Linkages With Reactions To An In Vivo Peer Evaluation Manipulation,"The present study examined the predictive validity of the Social Anxiety Scale for Children-Revised (SASC-R) by investigating associations between children's social anxiety symptoms and their cognitive and behavioral reactions in response to an in vivo peer evaluation manipulation. Participants (N = 115) ages 10-13, played a computer game based on the television show Survivor and were randomized to either a peer rejection (i.e., receiving the lowest total 'likeability' score from a group of peer-judges), a peer success (i.e., receiving the highest score), or a neutral peer feedback condition. Children reporting higher levels of social anxiety displayed more negative game-relevant performance expectations as well as more negative cognitive evaluations of both success and failure feedback. Moreover, regardless of feedback valence, children scoring higher on social anxiety reported greater reluctance to engage in game-related social activities. These findings provide support for the predictive validity of the SASC-R. © 2007.",doi,10.1016/j.janxdis.2006.10.007,Scopus,Journal of Anxiety Disorders,"Reijntjes A., Dekovic M., Telch M.J.",2007,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Tactile Feedback Display With Spatial And Temporal Resolutions,"We report the electronic recording of the touch contact and pressure using an active matrix pressure sensor array made of transparent zinc oxide thin-film transistors and tactile feedback display using an array of diaphragm actuators made of an interpenetrating polymer elastomer network. Digital replay, editing and manipulation of the recorded touch events were demonstrated with both spatial and temporal resolutions. Analog reproduction of the force is also shown possible using the polymer actuators, despite of the high driving voltage. The ability to record, store, edit, and replay touch information adds an additional dimension to digital technologies and extends the capabilities of modern information exchange with the potential to revolutionize physical learning, social networking, e-commerce, robotics, gaming, medical and military applications. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

,Taking Fun Seriously: Using Cognitive Models To Reason About Interaction With Computer Games,This paper seeks to extend the application of techniques from affective psychology to show how cognitive models can be used to represent and reason about interaction with computer games. It is argued that this modelling activity provides insights into the motivational appeal that often distinguishes computer games from other forms of human computer interaction. The long-term aim behind this research is to use our improved understanding of interaction with computer games to inform the subsequent development of more general classes of interactive systems. Barnard's Interacting Cognitive Subsystems (ICS) is used throughout this paper. This decision is justified by the fact that ICS has already been applied to analyse the negative emotions surrounding clinical depression. This previous work provides a useful starting point for our investigation of the more positive emotions evoked during interaction with computer games. A further justification is that ICS has also been successfully used to represent and reason about the design of human computer interfaces. © Springer-Verlag London Ltd.,doi,10.1007/BF01305335,Scopus,Personal and Ubiquitous Computing,Johnson C.,1999,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Task-Relevant Sound And User Experience In Computer-Mediated Firefighter Training,"The authors added task-relevant sounds to a computer-mediated instructor in-the-loop virtual training for firefighter commanders in an attempt to raise the engagement and arousal of the users. Computer-mediated training for crew commanders should provide a sensory experience that is sufficiently intense to make the training viable and effective. In practice, sound is an important source of information for firefighters. During an evaluation of a soundless computer-mediated and instructor in-the-loop virtual training, both trainees and instructors frequently remarked that the lack of sound made the simulation less convincing and engaging. Research on entertainment games has shown that users may experience higher levels of presence, engagement, and arousal when sound is included in the simulations. The authors therefore hypothesized that the addition of task-relevant (informative) sounds to a virtual training would raise the engagement and arousal of the users, and the overall convincingness of the simulation. In this study, they included verisimilar and task-relevant sounds in an instructor in-the-loop computer-mediated firefighter training and assessed how these sounds affect user experience. In contrast to the common belief of trainees and instructors, the authors find that merely adding task-relevant sounds does not necessarily increase the engagement and arousal of the users. The authors conclude that the physical presence of (and verbal communication with) the instructor probably distracted from the simulation, and an integral sound design involving mediated communication with a remotely present instructor may be required to resolve this problem. © 2012 SAGE Publications.",doi,10.1177/1046878112444564,Scopus,Simulation and Gaming,"Houtkamp J.M., Toet A., Bos F.A.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Task Versus Vehicle-Based Control Paradigms In Multiple Unmanned Vehicle Supervision By A Single Operator,"There has recently been a significant amount of activity in developing supervisory control algorithms for multiple unmanned aerial vehicle operation by a single operator. While previous work has demonstrated the favorable impacts that arise in the introduction of increasingly sophisticated autonomy algorithms, little work has performed an explicit comparison of different types of multiple unmanned vehicle control architectures on operator performance and workload. This paper compares a vehicle-based paradigm (where a single operator individually assigns tasks to unmanned assets) to a task-based paradigm (where the operator generates a task list, which is then given to the group of vehicles that determine how to best divide the tasks among themselves.) The results demonstrate significant advantages in using a task-based paradigm for both overall performance and robustness to increased workload. This effort also demonstrated that while previous video gaming experience mattered for performance, the degree of experience that demonstrated benefit was minimal. Further work should focus on designing a flexible automated system that allows operators to focus on a primary goal, but also facilitate lower level control when needed without degradation in performance. © 2013 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/THMS.2014.2304962,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems,"Cummings M.L., Bertucelli L.F., Macbeth J., Surana A.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas

,Temporal Dynamics Reveal Atypical Brain Response To Social Exclusion In Autism,"Despite significant social difficulties, children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are vulnerable to the effects of social exclusion. We recorded EEG while children with ASD and typical peers played a computerized game involving peer rejection. Children with ASD reported ostracism-related distress comparable to typically developing children. Event-related potentials (ERPs) indicated a distinct pattern of temporal processing of rejection events in children with ASD. While typically developing children showed enhanced response to rejection at a late slow wave indexing emotional arousal and regulation, those with autism showed attenuation at an early component, suggesting reduced engagement of attentional resources in the aversive social context. Results emphasize the importance of studying the time course of social information processing in ASD; they suggest distinct mechanisms subserving similar overt behavior and yield insights relevant to development and implementation of targeted treatment approaches and objective measures of response to treatment. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

,The 'Narrative Turn' In Developing Foresight: Assessing How Cultural Products Can Assist Organisations In Detecting Trends,"When developing foresight, it is essential to consider the information on which this activity is based. Weak signals, also conceptualised as trends, can be considered the most relevant input for developing foresight in an organisation. While detecting weak signals has traditionally relied on the news media, cultural products such as literature, movies, art, or computer games appear to have been neglected in the practice of foresight.However, literary genres such as novels can be a valuable source for developing foresight. Literature can be characterised as delivering ""thick descriptions"". Not only do novels describe social practices, but from them the reader also gains, for instance, deep insights into the feelings and emotions of the characters.These thick descriptions are even more interesting in the context of foresight when one considers that these descriptions play a role in the construction of social reality and therefore can influence, over time, reality, or rather translate fiction into fact. It can be argued that the new departs from cultural products, before translating into widely accepted social practices or mass-market products. The value of using literature in foresight also appears to be related to the notion that these narratives can be read as scenarios, revealing the potential of literature. Because of their narrative structure, these scenarios can overcome cognitive barriers in the development of foresight. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",doi,10.1016/j.techfore.2014.02.024,Scopus,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,Schwarz J.O.,2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,The Agilo Robot Soccer Team - Experience-Based Learning And Probabilistic Reasoning In Autonomous Robot Control,"This article describes the computational model underlying the AGILO autonomous robot soccer team, its implementation, and our experiences with it. According to our model the control system of an autonomous soccer robot consists of a probabilistic game state estimator and a situated action selection module. The game state estimator computes the robot's belief state with respect to the current game situation using a simple off-the-shelf camera system. The estimated game state comprises the positions and dynamic states of the robot itself and its teammates as well as the positions of the ball and the opponent players. Employing sophisticated probabilistic reasoning techniques and exploiting the cooperation between team mates, the robot can estimate complex game states reliably and accurately despite incomplete and inaccurate sensor information. The action selection module selects actions according to specified selection criteria as well as learned experiences. Automatic learning techniques made it possible to develop fast and skillful routines for approaching the ball, assigning roles, and performing coordinated plays. The paper discusses the computational techniques based on experimental data from the 2001 robot soccer world championship.",doi,10.1023/B:AURO.0000032938.72058.61,Scopus,Autonomous Robots,"Beetz M., Schmitt T., Hanek R., Buck S., Stulp F., Schröter D., Radig B.",2004,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,The American Psychological Association Task Force Assessment Of Violent Video Games: Science In The Service Of Public Interest,"A task force of experts was convened by the American Psychological Association (APA) to update the knowledge and policy about the impact of violent video game use on potential adverse outcomes. This APA Task Force on Media Violence examined the existing literature, including the meta-analyses in the field, since the last APA report on media violence in 2005. Because the most recent meta-analyses were published in 2010 and reflected work through 2009, the task force conducted a search of the published studies from 2009-2013. These recently published articles were scored and assessed by a systematic evidentiary review, followed by a meta-analysis of the high utility studies, as documented in the evidentiary review. Consistent with the literature that we reviewed, we found that violent video game exposure was associated with: an increased composite aggression score; increased aggressive behavior increased aggressive cognitions; increased aggressive affect, increased desensitization, and decreased empathy and increased physiological arousal. The size of the effects was similar to that in prior meta-analyses, suggesting a stable result. Our task force concluded that violent video game use is a risk factor for adverse outcomes, but found insufficient studies to examine any potential link between violent video game use and delinquency or criminal behavior.

,The Benefits Of Playing Video Games,"Video games are a ubiquitous part of almost all children's and adolescents' lives, with 97% playing for at least one hour per day in the United States. The vast majority of research by psychologists on the effects of ""gaming"" has been on its negative impact: the potential harm related to violence, addiction, and depression. We recognize the value of that research; however, we argue that a more balanced perspective is needed, one that considers not only the possible negative effects but also the benefits of playing these games. Considering these potential benefits is important, in part, because the nature of these games has changed dramatically in the last decade, becoming increasingly complex, diverse, realistic, and social in nature. A small but significant body of research has begun to emerge, mostly in the last five years, documenting these benefits. In this article, we summarize the research on the positive effects of playing video games, focusing on four main domains: cognitive, motivational, emotional, and social. By integrating insights from developmental, positive, and social psychology, as well as media psychology, we propose some candidate mechanisms by which playing video games may foster real-world psychosocial benefits. Our aim is to provide strong enough evidence and a theoretical rationale to inspire new programs of research on the largely unexplored mental health benefits of gaming. Finally, we end with a call to intervention researchers and practitioners to test the positive uses of video games, and we suggest several promising directions for doing so. © 2013 American Psychological Association.",doi,10.1037/a0034857,Scopus,American Psychologist,"Granic I., Lobel A., Engels R.C.M.E.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,The Effect Of A Β-Adrenoceptor Antagonist On Accommodative Adaptation In Hong Kong Children,"Purpose: Increased susceptibility to nearwork-induced accommodative adaptation has been suggested as a risk factor for myopia development. We investigated whether accommodative adaptation may explain in part the high prevalence of myopia in Hong Kong children and examined the effect of β-antagonism with topical timolol maleate on accommodative adaptation. Methods: Thirty children (10 emmetropes and 20 myopes) aged between 8 and 12 years were recruited. Tonic accommodation was measured before and after 5 min of video game-playing using an open-field Shin-Nippon auto refractor. Measurements were repeated 30 min after timolol instillation. Results: Children with progressing myopia demonstrated accommodative adaptation following the near task, whereas stable myopes showed counter-adaptive, hyperopic accommodative changes. Timolol increased the magnitude of accommodative adaptation in the stable myopes but had little effect on responses of the progressing myopes or emmetropes. Conclusions: Neuropharmacological modulation of the accommodative system may have a possible etiological role in the progression of myopia.",doi,10.1080/02713680490908571,Scopus,Current Eye Research,"Chen J.C., Schmid K.L., Brown B., Edwards M.H.",2005,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,The Effect Of Online Consumer Reviews On New Product Sales,"This study examines the effect of online reviews on new product sales for consumer electronics and video games. Analyses of panel data of 332 new products from Amazon.com over nine months reveal that the valence of reviews and the volume of page views have a stronger effect on search products, whereas the volume of reviews is more important for experience products. The results also show that the volume of reviews has a significant effect on new product sales in the early period and such effect decreases over time. Moreover, the percentage of negative reviews has a greater effect than that of positive reviews, confirming the negativity bias. Thus, marketers need to consider the distinctive influences of various aspects of online reviews when launching new products and devising e-marketing strategies. Copyright © 2012 M.E. Sharpe, Inc.

It was hypothesised that, during computer-game play, Type A and Type B subjects would have significantly higher heart rates as compared with baseline levels and that Type A subjects would experience a significantly greater increase in arousal when playing a computer game than Type B subjects.

Heart rate (HR) and HR variability were registered from before start until next morning. A questionnaire about emotional reactions was administered after gaming sessions and a sleep diary on the following mornings. RESULTS: During sleep, there were significant interaction effects between group and gaming condition for HR (means [standard errors] for low-exposed: NVG 63.8 [2.2] and VG 67.7 [2.4]; for high-exposed: NVG 65.5 [1.9] and VG 62.7 [1.9]; F(1,28) = 9.22, p = .005). There was also a significant interaction for sleep quality (low-exposed: NVG 4.3 [0.2] and VG 3.7 [0.3]); high-exposed: NVG 4.4 [0.2] and VG 4.4 [0.2]; F(1,28) = 3.51, p = .036, one sided), and sadness after playing (low-exposed: NVG 1.0 [0.0] and VG 1.4 [0.2]; high-exposed: NVG 1.2 [0.1] and VG 1.1 [0.1]; (F(1,27) = 6.29, p = .009, one sided). CONCLUSIONS: Different combinations of the extent of (low versus high) previous VG and experimental exposure to a VG or an NVG are associated with different reaction patterns - physiologically, emotionally, and sleep related. Desensitizing effects or selection bias stand out as possible explanations.

,The Effect Of Virtual Reality Distraction On Pain Relief During Dressing Changes In Children With Chronic Wounds On Lower Limbs,"It has been demonstrated that patients with chronic wounds experience the most pain during dressing changes. Currently, researchers focus mostly on analgesics and appropriate dressing materials to relieve pain during dressing changes of chronic wounds. However, the effect of nonpharmacologic interventions, such as virtual reality distraction, on pain management during dressing changes of pediatric chronic wounds remains poorly understood. To investigate the effect of virtual reality distraction on alleviating pain during dressing changes in children with chronic wounds on their lower limbs. A prospective randomized study. A pediatric center in a tertiary hospital. Sixty-five children, aged from 4 to 16 years, with chronic wounds on their lower limbs. Pain and anxiety scores during dressing changes were recorded by using the Wong-Baker Faces picture scale, visual analogue scale, and pain behavior scale, as well as physiological measurements including pulse rate and oxygen saturation. Time length of dressing change was recorded. Virtual reality distraction significantly relieved pain and anxiety scores during dressing changes and reduced the time length for dressing changes as compared to standard distraction methods. The use of virtual reality as a distraction tool in a pediatric ward offered superior pain reduction to children as compared to standard distractions. This device can potentially improve clinical efficiency by reducing length time for dressing changes. © 2015 American Society for Pain Management Nursing.",doi,10.1016/j.pmn.2015.03.001,Scopus,Pain Management Nursing,"Hua Y., Qiu R., Yao W.-Y., Zhang Q., Chen X.-L.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,"The Effects Of Autonomous Difficulty Selection On Engagement, Motivation, And Learning In A Motion-Controlled Video Game Task","This experiment investigated the relationship between motivation, engagement, and learning in a video game task. Previous studies have shown increased autonomy during practice leads to superior retention of motor skills, but it is not clear why this benefit occurs. Some studies suggest this benefit arises from increased motivation during practice; others suggest the benefit arises from better information processing. Sixty novice participants were randomly assigned to a self-controlled group, who chose the progression of difficulty during practice, or to a yoked group, who experienced the same difficulty progression but did not have choice. At the end of practice, participants completed surveys measuring intrinsic motivation and engagement. One week later, participants returned for a series of retention tests at three different difficulty levels. RM-ANCOVA (controlling for pre-test) showed that the self-controlled group had improved retention compared to the yoked group, on average, β = 46.78, 95% CI = [2.68, 90.87], p = 0.04, but this difference was only statistically significant on the moderate difficulty post-test (p = 0.004). The self-controlled group also showed greater intrinsic motivation during practice, t(58) = 2.61, p = 0.01. However, there was no evidence that individual differences in engagement (p = 0.20) or motivation (p = 0.87) were associated with learning, which was the relationship this experiment was powered to detect. These data are inconsistent with strictly motivational accounts of how autonomy benefits learning, instead suggesting the benefits of autonomy may be mediated through other mechanisms. For instance, within the information processing framework, the learning benefits may emerge from learners appropriately adjusting difficulty to maintain an appropriate level of challenge (i.e., maintaining the relationship between task demands and cognitive resources). © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",doi,10.1016/j.humov.2016.08.005,Scopus,Human Movement Science,"Leiker A.M., Bruzi A.T., Miller M.W., Nelson M., Wegman R., Lohse K.R.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,The Effects Of Prosocial And Aggressive Video Games On Children’s Donating And Helping.,"We investigated the effects of a prosocial and an aggressive videogame on children's prosocial behavior. Third-, fourth-, seventh-, and eighth-grade boys and girls (N = 160) were randomly assigned to either a control condition or one of four treatment conditions. In two of the treatment conditions, children played a videogame with prosocial content either singly or cooperatively with another child. In the other two conditions, children played an aggressive videogame either singly or competitively. Subsequent levels of donating and helping were measured. A three-way analysis of variance indicated that older students donated significantly more than did younger students. Children who played either of the aggressive videogames donated significantly less than did those who played prosocial games by themselves. No significant effects were found for helping. Playing the prosocial videogame did not increase prosocial responding, but playing the aggressive videogame tended to suppress this behavior. The failure of the prosocial game to accelerate prosocial responding might be due to the relatively brief treatments used in this study and/or to the particular prosocial videogame utilized.",doi,10.1080/00221325.1987.10532488,anderson2010,Journal of Genetic Psychology,"Chambers, J.

,"The Effects Of Single Bouts Of Aerobic Exercise, Exergaming, And Videogame Play On Cognitive Control","Objective: The effects of single bouts of aerobic exercise, exergaming, and action videogame play on event-related brain potentials (ERPs) and task performance indices of cognitive control were investigated using a modified flanker task that manipulated demands of attentional inhibition. Methods: Participants completed four counterbalanced sessions of 20min of activity intervention (i.e., seated rest, seated videogame play, and treadmill-based and exergame-based aerobic exercise at 60% HRmax) followed by cognitive testing once heart rate (HR) returned to within 10% of pre-activity levels. Results: Results indicated decreased RT interference following treadmill exercise relative to seated rest and videogame play. P3 amplitude was increased following treadmill exercise relative to rest, suggesting an increased allocation of attentional resources during stimulus engagement. The seated videogame and exergame conditions did not differ from any other condition. Conclusions: The findings indicate that single bouts of treadmill exercise may improve cognitive control through an increase in the allocation of attentional resources and greater interference control during cognitively demanding tasks. However, similar benefits may not be derived following short bouts of aerobic exergaming or seated videogame participation. Significance: Although exergames may increase physical activity participation, they may not exert the same benefits to brain and cognition as more traditional physical activity behaviors. © 2011 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.",doi,10.1016/j.clinph.2011.01.049,Scopus,Clinical Neurophysiology,"O'Leary K.C., Pontifex M.B., Scudder M.R., Brown M.L., Hillman C.H.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,The Effects Of Time-Varying Rewards On The Evolution Of Cooperation,"Understanding how cooperative behavior emerges within a population of autonomous individuals has been the focus of a great deal of research in biology, economics and more recently in the multi-agent systems domain. However, there are still many open questions. In this paper, we address some of these questions by investigating the effects of time-varying, non-symmetric rewards on the evolution of cooperation in the spatial Prisoner's dilemma game. The rationale behind this approach is based on the notion that the associated payoffs from pursuing certain strategies do vary among members of real-world populations. In our model, agents with limited cognitive capacity play the game with their local neighbours. In addition to its game playing strategy, each agent has additional attributes that can be used to control the number of rounds of the game the agent actually participates in, as well as the magnitude of any rewards that it receives. Numerical simulations show that dynamic updates to payoff values induce a change in equilibrium cooperation levels. This suggests that heterogeneous payoff values and social diversity within a cost-benefit context are important factors in the promotion of cooperation in the spatial Prisoner's dilemma game. © Springer-Verlag 2009.",doi,10.1007/s12065-009-0032-1,Scopus,Evolutionary Intelligence,"Rezaei G., Kirley M.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,The Energy Cost Of Playing Active Video Games In Children With Obesity And Children Of A Healthy Weight,"What is already known about this subject Active video games (AVGs) are being marketed as exercise tools. AVG play can result in light-to-moderate intensity physical activity. What this study adds A comparison correcting for body size between the energy expended by children with obesity and those of a healthy weight playing AVGs. An examination of several variables related to the energy cost of AVG play including steps taken and rate of perceived exertion. There may be some differences in how children with obesity and children of a healthy weight play AVGs. Background Increasing physical activity and reducing sedentary behaviour form a large part of the treatment of paediatric obesity. However, many children today spend prolonged periods of time playing sedentary video games. Active video games (AVGs) represent a novel and child friendly form of physical activity. Objectives To measure the energy cost of playing two AVGs in children with obesity and healthy age- and gender-matched children. Methods The energy cost of gaming and heart rates achieved during gaming conditions were compared between groups. Results AVG play can result in light-to-moderate intensity physical activity (2.7-5.4metabolic equivalents). When corrected for fat-free mass those with obesity expended significantly less energy than healthy weight peers playing Nintendo Wii Fit Free Jogging (P=0.017). No significant difference was seen between groups in the energy cost of playing Boxing. Conclusion Certain AVGs, particularly those that require lower limb movement, could be used to increase total energy expenditure, replace more sedentary activities, or achieve moderate intensity physical activity among children with obesity. There seems to be some differences in how children with obesity and children of a healthy weight play AVGs. This could result in those with obesity expending less energy than their lean peers during AVG play. © 2013 The Authors.

,The Envious Brain: The Neural Basis Of Social Comparison,"Humans have a drive to evaluate themselves by examining their abilities and outcomes in comparison to others. The present study examined the emotional and neural correlates of upward social comparison (comparison with those who have more) and downward social comparison (comparison with those who have less). Two experiments were conducted with volunteers in an interactive game of chance, in which a putative player won or lost more money than the participant. The results showed that even when participants lost money, they expressed joy and schadenfreude (gloating) if the other player had lost more money. On the other hand when they actually won money, but the other player had won more they expressed envy. This pattern was also demonstrated in a differential BOLD response in the ventral striatum. Comparing the activations between an actual gain and a relative gain indicated that even when a person loses money, merely adding information about another person's greater loss may increase ventral striatum activations to a point where these activations are similar to those of an actual gain. We suggest that the ventral striatum plays a role in mediating the emotional consequences of social comparison. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",doi,10.1002/hbm.20972,Scopus,Human Brain Mapping,"Dvash J., Gilam G., Ben-Ze'ev A., Hendler T., Shamay-Tsoory S.G.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,The Evolutionary Dynamics Of A Population Model With A Strong Allee Effect,"An evolutionary game theoretic model for a population subject to predation and a strong Allee threshold of extinction is analyzed using, among other methods, Poincaré-Bendixson theory. The model is a nonlinear, plane autonomous system whose state variables are population density and the mean of a phenotypic trait, which is subject to Darwinian evolution, that determines the population's inherent (low density) growth rate (fitness). A trade-off is assumed in that an increase in the inherent growth rate results in a proportional increase in the predator's attack rate. The main results are that orbits equilibrate (there are no cycles or cycle chains of saddles), that the extinction set (or Allee basin) shrinks when evolution occurs, and that the meant trait component of survival equilibria occur at maxima of the inherent growth rate (as a function of the trait).",doi,10.3934/mbe.2015.12.643,Scopus,Mathematical Biosciences and Engineering,Cushing J.M.,2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas

,The Impact Of A School-Based Active Video Game Play Intervention On Children's Physical Activity During Recess,"Purpose. To assess physical activity levels during active video game play over time and compare this to 'free play' associated with recess activity in a sample of British primary school children over a 6-week period. Basic procedures. Thirty children (ages 10-11, 12 boys, 18 girls) from central England were randomly selected to participate in a 6 week, recess based, active video gaming intervention (n = 15) or act as controls (n = 15). Repeated measures analysis of covariance (controlling for body fatness) was used to examine any differences in physical activity, determined by pedometry and heart rate monitoring over time and between intervention and control groups. Main Findings. Children in the intervention accumulated significantly greater steps/day than the control group during the first week of the intervention. This pattern was reversed at the mid and end points of the intervention (p = .03). Irrespective of time point, children engaging in active video game play spent a lesser percentage of time engaged in MVPA than the controls undertaking 'traditional' recess activity (p = .0001). Conclusions. Active video game play does not appear to be a sustainable means to enhance children's physical activity. Although physical activity (steps/min) was greater on initial presentation of active video games compared to 'traditional' recess activity, this appears to be an acute effect.",doi,10.2478/v10038-009-0023-1,Scopus,Human Movement,"Duncan M.J., Staples V.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,The Impact Of Anxiety On Social Decision-Making: Behavioral And Electrodermal Findings,"Anxiety plays an important role in social behavior. For instance, high-anxious individuals are more likely to avoid such social interactions as communicating with strangers. In this study, we investigate the impact of anxiety on social decision-making. The classic ultimatum game (UG) paradigm was utilized in concert with skin conductance recording. Behavioral results reveal that when playing as responders, high-trait anxiety (HTA) participants with lower levels of self-esteem, as well as low-trait anxiety (LTA) participants with higher levels of impulsivity, were more likely to accept human-proposed inequitable offers. In addition, the HTA participants rejected more computer-proposed inequitable offers than did LTA participants. Moreover, the skin conductance response to inequitable offers was correlated with levels of anxiety in the HTA group, but not in the LTA group. In conclusion, people differing in levels of anxiety showed distinct behavior patterns and autonomic neural responses during social decision-making, whereas the levels of self-esteem, impulsivity, and depression might be additional moderating factors. These findings contextualize high-anxious people's avoidance tendency in social interaction. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",doi,10.1080/17470919.2012.694372,Scopus,Social Neuroscience,"Wu T., Luo Y., Broster L.S., Gu R., Luo Y.-J.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,The Impact Of Loss Of Control On Movement Bcis,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are known to suffer from spontaneous changes in the brain activity. If changes in the mental state of the user are reflected in the brain signals used for control, the behavior of a BCI is directly influenced by these states. We investigate the influence of a state of loss of control in a variant of Pacman on the performance of BCIs based on motor control. To study the effect a temporal loss of control has on the BCI performance, BCI classifiers were trained on electroencephalography (EEG) recorded during the normal control condition, and the classification performance on segments of EEG from the normal and loss of control condition was compared. Classifiers based on event-related desynchronization unexpectedly performed significantly better during the loss of control condition; for the event-related potential classifiers there was no significant difference in performance. © 2006 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TNSRE.2011.2166562,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering,"Reuderink B., Poel M., Nijholt A.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,The Important Role Of The Context In Which Achievement Goals Are Adopted: An Experimental Test,"Two experimental studies using Elliot, Murayama, and Pekrun’s (Journal of Educational Psychology 103(3):632–648, 2011) differentiation between self-goals and task-goals, were conducted to examine the relative influence of achievement goals and motivational contexts on behavioral and emotional engagement. In Study 1, 133 college students were prompted to adopt self-goals (intrapersonal standards) or other-goals (performance standards) in one of two motivational contexts (autonomy-supportive or autonomy-suppressive) while playing a computer game. In Study 2, 129 college students performed the same assignment, this time adopting either other-goals or task-goals (absolute standards). Study 1 indicated that autonomy-support facilitated behavioral and emotional engagement in autonomy suppressive contexts, but self-goals merely promoted emotional engagement relative to other-goals. Study 2 replicated Study 1’s findings by showing that autonomy support promoted self-reported behavioral engagement and task-goals promoted emotional engagement but further revealed that only when task-goals were adopted in an autonomy-supportive context did they promote better behavioral engagement than other-goals. Thus, Study 2 highlighted the importance of the context in which the achievement goals were adopted (i.e., autonomy-supportive versus suppressive) as an important determinant of the outcome. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",doi,10.1007/s11031-016-9600-8,Scopus,Motivation and Emotion,"Benita M., Shane N., Elgali O., Roth G.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,The Influence Of Acutely Administered Nicotine On Cue-Induced Craving For Gambling In At-Risk Video Lottery Terminal Gamblers Who Smoke,"Evidence indicates that tobacco use and gambling often co-occur. Despite this association, little is known about how tobacco use affects the propensity to gamble. Nicotine, the putative addictive component of tobacco, has been reported to potentiate the hedonic value of other nonsmoking stimuli. Environmental cues have been identified as an important contributor to relapse in addictive behavior; however, the extent to which nicotine can affect the strength of gambling cues remains unknown. This study examined whether nicotine influences subjective ratings for gambling following gambling cues. In a mixed within/between-subjects design, 30 (20 men) video lottery terminal (VLT) gamblers ('moderate-risk' or 'problem' gamblers) who smoke daily were assigned to nicotine (4 mg deliverable) or placebo lozenge conditions. Subjective and behavioral responses were assessed at baseline, following lozenge, following neutral cues, and following presentation of gambling cues. Nicotine lozenge was found to significantly reduce tobacco-related cravings (P<0.05) but did not affect gambling-related cravings, the choice to play a VLT, or other subjective responses. These results suggest that a low dose of acutely administered nicotine does not increase cue-induced craving for gambling in at-risk VLT gamblers who smoke. © 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams &Wilkins.",doi,10.1097/FBP.0b013e32835f3cff,Scopus,Behavioural Pharmacology,"McGrath D.S., Dorbeck A., Barrett S.P.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas

,The Influence Of Personality Traits On Emotion Expression In Bulimic Spectrum Disorders: A Pilot Study,"Facial expressions are critical in forming social bonds and in signalling one's emotional state to others. In eating disorder patients, impairments in facial emotion recognition have been associated with eating psychopathology severity. Little research however has been carried out on how bulimic spectrum disorder (BSD) patients spontaneously express emotions. Our aim was to investigate emotion expression in BSD patients and to explore the influence of personality traits. Our study comprised 28 BSD women and 15 healthy controls. Facial expressions were recorded while participants played a serious video game. Expressions of anger and joy were used as outcome measures. Overall, BSD participants displayed less facial expressiveness than controls. Among BSD women, expressions of joy were positively associated with reward dependence, novelty seeking and self-directedness, whereas expressions of anger were associated with lower self-directedness. Our findings suggest that specific personality traits are associated with altered emotion facial expression in patients with BSD.

,The Influence Of Violent And Nonviolent Computer Games On Implicit Measures Of Aggressiveness,"We examined the causal relationship between playing violent video games and increases in aggressiveness by using implicit measures of aggressiveness, which have become important for accurately predicting impulsive behavioral tendencies. Ninety-six adults were randomly assigned to play one of three versions of a computer game that differed only with regard to game content (violent, peaceful, or abstract game), or to work on a reading task. In the games the environmental context, mouse gestures, and physiological arousal-as indicated by heart rate and skin conductance-were kept constant. In the violent game soldiers had to be shot, in the peaceful game sunflowers had to be watered, and the abstract game simply required clicking colored triangles. Five minutes of play did not alter trait aggressiveness, yet an Implicit Association Test detected a change in implicit aggressive selfconcept. Playing a violent game produced a significant increase in implicit aggressive self-concept relative to playing a peaceful game. The well-controlled study closes a gap in the research on the causality of the link between violence exposure in computer games and aggressiveness with specific regard to implicit measures. We discuss the significance of importing recent social-cognitive theory into aggression research and stress the need for further development of aggression-related implicit measures. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",doi,10.1002/ab.20329,Scopus,Aggressive Behavior,"Bluemke M., Friedrich M., Zumbach J.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,The Iowa Gambling Task In Fmri Images,"The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) is a sensitive test for the detection of decision-making impairments in several neurological and psychiatric populations. Very few studies have employed the IGT in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) investigations, in part, because the task is cognitively complex. Here we report a method for exploring brain activity using fMRI during performance of the IGT. Decision-making during the IGT was associated with activity in several brain regions in a group of healthy individuals. The activated regions were consistent with the neural circuitry hypothesized to underlie somatic marker activation and decision-making. Specifically, a neural circuitry involving the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (for working memory), the insula and posterior cingulate cortex (for representations of emotional states), the mesial orbitofrontal and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (for coupling the two previous processes), the ventral striatum and anterior cingulate/SMA (supplementary motor area) for implementing behavioral decisions was engaged. These results have implications for using the IGT to study abnormal mechanisms of decision making in a variety of clinical populations. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",doi,10.1002/hbm.20875,Scopus,Human Brain Mapping,"Li X., Lu Z.-L., D'Argembeau A., Ng M., Bechara A.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas

,The Path Between Pedagogy And Technology: Establishing A Theoretical Basis For The Development Of Educational Game Environments,"The power of computer game technology is currently being harnessed to produce ""serious games"". These ""games"" are targeted at the education and training marketplace, and employ various key game-engine components such as the graphics and physics engines to produce realistic ""digital-world"" simulations of the real ""physical world"". Many approaches are driven by the technology and often lack a consideration of a firm pedagogical underpinning. The authors believe that an analysis and deployment of both the technological and pedagogical dimensions should occur together, with the pedagogical dimension providing the lead. This chapter explores the relationship between these two dimensions, and explores how ""pedagogy may inform the use of technology"", how various learning theories may be mapped onto the use of the affordances of computer game engines. Autonomous and collaborative learning approaches are discussed. The design of a serious game is broken down into spatial and temporal elements. The spatial dimension is related to the theories of knowledge structures, especially ""concept maps"". The temporal dimension is related to ""experiential learning"", especially the approach of Kolb. The multi-player aspect of serious games is related to theories of ""collaborative learning"" which is broken down into a discussion of ""discourse"" versus ""dialogue"". Several general guiding principles are explored, such as the use of ""metaphor"" (including metaphors of space, embodiment, systems thinking, the internet and emergence). The topological design of a serious game is also highlighted. The discussion of pedagogy is related to various serious games we have recently produced and researched, and is presented in the hope of informing the ""serious game community"". © 2009, IGI Global.",doi,10.4018/978-1-60566-360-9.ch012,Scopus,Games-Based Learning Advancements for Multi-Sensory Human Computer Interfaces: Techniques and Effective Practices,Price C.,2009,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,"The Pedisedate® Device, A Novel Approach To Pediatric Sedation That Provides Distraction And Inhaled Nitrous Oxide: Clinical Evaluation In A Large Case Series","Background: Pediatric sedation is of paramount importance but can be challenging. Fear and anticipatory anxiety before invasive procedures often lead to uncooperativeness. A novel device (PediSedate®) provides sedation through a combination of inhaled nitrous oxide and distraction (video game). We evaluated the acceptability and safety of the PediSedate® device in children. Methods: We enrolled children between 3 and 9 years old who were scheduled to undergo surgical procedures that required general inhalational anesthesia. After the device was applied, he/she played a video game while listening to the audio portion of the game through the earphones. Nitrous oxide in oxygen was administered via the nasal piece of the headset starting at 50% and increasing to 70%, in 10% increments every 8 min. Treatment failures, vital signs, arterial oxygen saturation, depth of sedation, airway patency, side effects, acceptance of the device and parental satisfaction were all evaluated. Results: Of 100 children included, treatment failure occurred in 18% mainly because of poor tolerance of the device. At least 96% of the children who completed the study exhibited an excellent degree of sedation, 22% had side effects, and none experienced serious airway obstruction. Nausea and vomiting were the most common side effects and no patients had hemodynamic instability. Conclusions: The PediSedate® device combines nonpharmacologic with pharmacologic methods of sedation. Most of the children we evaluated were able to tolerate the PediSedate® device and achieved an adequate degree of sedation. © 2007 The Authors.",doi,10.1111/j.1460-9592.2006.02091.x,Scopus,Paediatric Anaesthesia,"Denman W.T., Tuason P.M., Ahmed M.I., Brennen L.M., Soledad Cepeda M., Carr D.B.",2007,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas

We describe a technique which allows to continuously control both the age of a synthetic voice and the quantity of emotions that are expressed. Also, we present the first large-scale data mining experiment about the automatic recognition of basic emotions in informal everyday short utterances. We focus on the speaker-dependent problem. We compare a large set of machine learning algorithms, ranging from neural networks, Support Vector Machines or decision trees, together with 200 features, using a large database of several thousands examples. We show that the difference of performance among learning schemes can be substantial, and that some features which were previously unexplored are of crucial importance. An optimal feature set is derived through the use of a genetic algorithm. Finally, we explain how this study can be applied to real world situations in which very few examples are available. Furthermore, we describe a game to play with a personal robot which facilitates teaching of examples of emotional utterances in a natural and rather unconstrained manner. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

,"The Psychophysiology Of Flow During Piano Playing. Emotion, 10(3), 301–311.","Expert performance is commonly accompanied by a subjective state of optimal experience called flow. Previous research has shown positive correlations between flow and quality of performance and suggests that flow may function as a reward signal that promotes practice. Here, piano playing was used as a flow-inducing behavior in order to analyze the relationship between subjective flow reports and psychophysiological measures. Professional classical pianists were asked to play a musical piece and then rate state flow. The performance was repeated five times in order to induce a variation in flow, keeping other factors constant, while recording the arterial pulse pressure waveform, respiration, head movements, and activity from the corrugator supercilii and zygomaticus major facial muscles. A significant relation was found between flow and heart period, blood pressure, heart rate variability, activity of the zygomaticus major muscle, and respiratory depth. These findings are discussed in relation to current models of emotion, attention, and expertise, and flow is proposed to be a state of effortless attention, which arises through an interaction between positive affect and high attention.",doi,10.1037/a0018432,nagy2015,Emotion,"De Manzano, Ö., Theorell, T., Harmat, L., Ullén, F.",2010,NA,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,The Racing-Game Effect: Why Do Video Racing Games Increase Risk-Taking Inclinations?,"The present studies investigated why video racing games increase players' risk-taking inclinations. Four studies reveal that playing video racing games increases risk taking in a subsequent simulated road traffic situation, as well as risk-promoting cognitions and emotions, blood pressure, sensation seeking, and attitudes toward reckless driving. Study 1 ruled out the role of experimental demand in creating such effects. Studies 2 and 3 showed that the effect of playing video racing games on risk taking was partially mediated by changes in self-perceptions as a reckless driver. These effects were evident only when the individual played racing games that reward traffic violations rather than racing games that do not reward traffic violations (Study 3) and when the individual was an active player of such games rather than a passive observer (Study 4). In sum, the results underline the potential negative impact of racing games on traffic safety. © 2009 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.",doi,10.1177/0146167209339628,Scopus,Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin,"Fischer P., Greitemeyer T., Morton T., Kastenmüller A., Postmes T., Frey D., Kubitzki J., Odenwälder J.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,The Re-Regulation Of Control In The Context Of Project-Based Work,In recent years project-based work appeared the key for the management of knowledge-intensive firms. Project-based work entails that traditional control systems be transformed in order to unleash the autonomy of qualified and capable workers. Thus the way in which control systems are being re-regulated requires critical research. Based on a case study involving a development team working within a firm in the video game industry we focus on control practices and draw the outline of a framework for the analysis of control. © Copyright 2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.,doi,10.1504/IJWI.2015.074170,Scopus,International Journal of Work Innovation,"Briand L., Hodgson D.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,The Relationship Between Online Video Game Involvement And Gaming-Related Friendships Among Emotionally Sensitive Individuals,"Some researchers believe that online gaming spaces can be socially accommodating environments for socially inhibited individuals, such as the socially inept, socially anxious, or shy. While previous research has examined, and found, significant links between these populations and online video game play, it remains unknown to what extent these spaces are contributing to tangible social benefits for the socially inhibited. The current study addresses this question by evaluating the link between gaming-related friendships and shyness, as quantified by emotional sensitivity. Drawing from a representative sample of German game players, the results indicate that emotionally sensitive players are using online gaming spaces differently from their less emotionally sensitive counterparts and reporting tangible differences in their in-game friendship networks. This suggests that online games hold the potential to be socially advantageous for shy individuals by allowing them to overcome their traditional social difficulties and generate new friendships as well as strengthen old ones. © 2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2014.",doi,10.1089/cyber.2013.0656,Scopus,"Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking","Kowert R., Domahidi E., Quandt T.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,"The Role Of Computer Games In Measuring Spirometry In Healthy And ""Asthmatic"" Preschool Children","Study objectives: To explore the role of respiratory interactive computer games in teaching spirometry to preschool children, and to examine whether the spirometry data achieved are compatible with acceptable criteria for adults and with published data for healthy preschool children, and whether spirometry at this age can assess airway obstruction. Design: Feasibility study. Settings: Community kindergartens around Israel and a tertiary pediatric pulmonary clinic. Participants: Healthy and asthmatic preschool children (age range, 2.0 to 6.5 years). Intervention: Multitarget interactive spirometry games including three targets: full inspiration before expiration, instant forced expiration, and long expiration to residual volume. Measurements and results: One hundred nine healthy and 157 asthmatic children succeeded in performing adequate spirometry using a multitarget interactive spirometry game. American Thoracic Society (ATS)/European Respiratory Society spirometry criteria for adults for the start of the test, and repeatability were met. Expiration time increased with age (1.3 ± 0.3 s at 3 years to 1.9 ± 0.3 s at 6 years [± SD], p &lt; 0.05). FVC and flow rates increased with age, while FEV1/FVC decreased. Healthy children had FVC and FEV1 values similar to those of previous preschool studies, but flows were significantly higher (&gt; 1.5 SD for forced expiratory flow at 50% of vital capacity [FEF50] and forced expiratory flow at 75% of vital capacity [FEF75], p &lt; 0.005). The descending part of the flow/volume curve was convex in 2.5- to 3.5-year-old patients, resembling that of infants, while in 5- to 6-year-old patients, there was linear decay. Asthma severity by Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines correlated with longer expiration time (1.7 ± 0.4 s; p &lt; 0.03) and lower FEF50 (32 to 63%; p &lt; 0.001) compared to healthy children. Bronchodilators improved FEV1 by 10 to 13% and FEF50 by 38 to 56% of baseline. Conclusions: Interactive respiratory games can facilitate spirometry in very young children, yielding results that conform to most of the ATS criteria established for adults and published data for healthy preschool children.

,The Role Of Flow Experience In Cyber-Game Addiction,"Consumer habit, an important key to repetitive consumption, is an interesting yet puzzling phenomenon. Sometimes this consumption becomes obsessive-consumers will continue to act a certain way even when they feel it is not in their best interests. However, not all consumers develop such addictions. This study uses cyber-game addiction syndrome as an analogue to trace the possible causes of consumer addiction. Results from structure equation modeling show that repetition of favorite activities has a moderate effect upon addiction, which is in line with the assertion of rational addiction theory. However, flow experience-the emotional state embracing perceptional distortion and enjoyment-shows a much stronger impact on addiction. This suggests that consumers who have experienced flow are more likely to be addicted.",doi,10.1089/109493103322725469,Scopus,Cyberpsychology and Behavior,"Chou T.-J., Ting C.-C.",2003,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas

,The Self-Paced Graz Brain-Computer Interface: Methods And Applications,"We present the self-paced 3-class Graz brain-computer interface (BCI) which is based on the detection of sensorimotor electroencephalogram (EEG) rhythms induced by motor imagery. Self-paced operation means that the BCI is able to determine whether the ongoing brain activity is intended as control signal (intentional control) or not (non-control state). The presented system is able to automatically reduce electrooculogram (EOG) artifacts, to detect electromyographic (EMG) activity, and uses only three bipolar EEG channels. Two applications are presented: the freeSpace virtual environment (VE) and the Brainloop interface. The freeSpace is a computer-game-like application where subjects have to navigate through the environment and collect coins by autonomously selecting navigation commands. Three subjects participated in these feedback experiments and each learned to navigate through the VE and collect coins. Two out of the three succeeded in collecting all three coins.

,The Temporal Course Of The Influence Of Anxiety On Fairness Considerations,"This study investigated the potential causes of anxious people's social avoidance. The classic ultimatum game was utilized in concert with electroencephalogram recording. Participants were divided into two groups according to levels of trait anxiety as identified by a self-report scale. The behavioral results indicate that high-anxious participants were more prone to reject human-proposed than computer-proposed unequal offers compared to their low-anxious counterparts. The event-related potential results indicate that the high-anxious group showed a larger feedback-related negativity when receiving unequal monetary offers than equal ones, and a larger P3 when receiving human-proposed offers than computer-proposed ones, but these effects were absent in the low-anxious group. We suggest anxious people's social avoidance results from hypersensitivity to unequal distributions during interpersonal interactions. © 2014 Society for Psychophysiological Research.",doi,10.1111/psyp.12235,Scopus,Psychophysiology,"Luo Y., Wu T., Broster L.S., Feng C., Zhang D., Gu R., Luo Y.-J.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,The Timing Of Appraisals,"The appraisal process consists of the subjective evaluation that occurs during an individual's encounter with significant events in the environment, determining the nature of the emotional reaction and experience. Placed in the context of appraisal theories of emotion-elicitation and differentiation, the aim of the present research was to test empirically the hypothesis that the intrinsic pleasantness evaluation occurs before the goal conduciveness evaluation. In two studies, intrinsically pleasant and unpleasant images were used to manipulate pleasantness, and a specific event in a Pacman-type videogame was used to manipulate goal conduciveness. Facial EMG was used to measure facial reactions to each evaluation. As predicted, facial reactions to the intrinsic pleasantness manipulation were faster than facial reactions to the goal conduciveness manipulation. These results provide good empirical support for the sequential nature of the appraisal process. © 2007 APA, all rights reserved.",doi,10.1037/1528-3542.7.1.207,Scopus,Emotion,"Lanctôt N., Hess U.",2007,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas

,"The University Of The National Football League: How Technology, Injury Surveillance, And Health Care Have Improved The Safety Of America's Game","American football has become one of the most popular sports in the United States. Despite the millions of players at all levels of competition who gain the physical, social, and psychological rewards that football provides, many interested stakeholders continue to ask, Is football safe? Although there are only approximately 1,700 players on National Football League (NFL) rosters, the injuries they sustain have garnered the most attention-and criticism-from the national media. Increased public awareness of the injury potential football possesses has led to an open debate and a major shift in public sentiment over the past 5 years. Although no sport is perfectly safe, the question is whether it can be made relatively safe and if the long-term consequences are worth the risk.

,The Winner Takes It All: The Effect Of In-Game Success And Need Satisfaction On Mood Repair And Enjoyment,"Recent research found that playing video games is able to serve mood management purposes as well as contribute to gratifications such as need satisfaction. Both aspects can foster the enjoyment as entertainment experience. The current study explores the question of how in-game success as a prerequisite for satisfying the need for competence and autonomy positively influences mood repair and game enjoyment. In a laboratory setting, participants were frustrated via a highly stressing math task and then played a video game (Mario Kart). Results show that in-game success drives mood repair as reflected in the experience of anger, happiness and activation. Moreover, fulfilling the intrinsic needs for competence and autonomy mediated the effects of in-game success and predicted enjoyment of the video game. Results are discussed in context of recent conceptualizations of media entertainment and the hierarchical order of emotional gratifications. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

,To Plan Or To Simply React? An Experimental Study Of Action Planning In A Game Environment,"Many contemporary computer games, notably action and role-playing games, represent an interesting class of navigation-intensive dynamic real-time simulations inhabited by autonomous intelligent virtual agents (IVAs). Although higher level reasoning of IVAs in these domains seems suited for action planning, planning is not widely adopted in existing games and similar applications. Moreover, statistically rigorous study measuring performance of planners in decision making in a game-like domain is missing. Here, five classical planners were connected to the virtual environment of Unreal Development Kit along with a planner for delete-free domains (only positive preconditions and positive effects). Performance of IVAs employing those planners and IVAs with reactive architecture was measured on a class of game-inspired test environments of various sizes and under different levels of external interference. The analysis has shown that planning agents outperform reactive agents if (i) the size of the problem is small or if (b) the environment changes are either hostile to the agent or infrequent. In delete-free domains, specialized approaches are inferior to classical planners because the lower expressivity of delete-free domains results in lower plan quality. These results can help to determine when planning is advantageous in games and for IVAs control in other dynamic real-time environments. ©2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",doi,10.1111/coin.12079,Scopus,Computational Intelligence,"Černý M., Barták R., Brom C., Gemrot J.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Toward Emotionally-Congruent Dynamic Soundtrack Generation,"Emotionally congruent sound effect generation can be particularly useful in interactive audio applications with non-linear narrative requirements (such as video gaming). The study of affect (broadly construed here as recognition of emotional suggestion rather than individual emotional response) increasingly concludes that acoustic features can have an influence on the perceived emotional characteristics of an audio signal, from environmental sounds to musical stimuli. This paper presents an investigative approach to measuring the relative impact of musical voicing, in particular musical timbre, on perceived emotion as reported by a panel of listeners, as part of work towards an automated system designed to manipulate sound effects in real-time according to a particular affective intent. In the future this type of system could combine selective spectro-temporal morphing between source sounds and affective acoustic correlates with musical feature quantification and interpolation in order to manipulate a palette of sound effects or music through an emotional space based on quantified affective correlates. © 2016.",doi,10.17743/jaes.2016.0038,Scopus,AES: Journal of the Audio Engineering Society,Williams D.,2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Toward Physiological Indices Of Emotional State Driving Future Ebook Interactivity,"Ebooks of the future may respond to the emoional experience of the reader. (Neuro-) physiological measures could capture a reader's emotional state and use this to enhance the reading experience by adding matching sounds or to change the storyline therewith creating a hybrid art form in between literature and gaming. We describe the theoretical foundation of the emotional and creative brain and review the neurophysiological indices that can be used to drive future ebook interactivity in a real life situation. As a case study, we report the neurophysiological measurements of a bestselling author during nine days of writing which can potentially be used later to compare them to those of the readers. In designated calibration blocks, the artist wrote emotional paragraphs for emotional (IAPS) pictures. Analyses showed that we can reliably distinguish writing blocks from resting but we found no reliable differences related to the emotional content of the writing. The study shows that measurements of EEG, heart rate (variability), skin conductance, facial expression and subjective ratings can be done over several hours a day and for several days in a row. In follow-up phases, we will measure 300 readers with a similar setup. © 2016 van Erp et al.",doi,10.7717/peerj-cs.60,Scopus,PeerJ Computer Science,"van Erp J.B.F., Hogervorst M.A., van der Werf Y.D.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Traumatic Rupture Of A Meckel's Diverticulum Due To Blunt Abdominal Trauma In A Soccer Game: A Case Report,"Introduction a Meckel's diverticulum is one of the most common congenital anomalies of the digestive tract. The reported lifetime complication rate is 4%, mostly due to hemorrhage, obstruction, perforation or inflammation. A symptomatic Meckel's diverticulum due to rupture after blunt abdominal trauma is very rare. We believe this case report is the first reporting a rupture of a Meckel's diverticulum after a low velocity blunt abdominal trauma and outlining the importance of a thorough and complete examination of the patient after blunt abdominal trauma. Presentation of case a 17-year-old male presented with abdominal pain after blunt abdominal trauma during a soccer game. Physical examination showed signs of peritonitis in all quadrants of the abdomen. During admission the patient deteriorated with decreasing blood pressure and raising pulse rate. A CT-scan showed free abdominal fluid. Our patient was scheduled for an emergent laparotomy where a perforated Meckel's diverticulum with fecal spill was found. A segmental ileal resection was performed. Post-operative, patient developed a pneumonia and also intra-abdominal abscesses treated with percutaneous drainage. After an admission period of 17-days the patient was discharged. Conclusion perforation of a Meckel's diverticulum is rarely suspected as a cause of acute deterioration following blunt abdominal trauma. This case shows the importance of awareness of this kind of injury especially in male patients. © 2015 The Authors.

,Uav Testbed Training Platform Development Using Panda3d,"Purpose The paper aims to report the development of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Testbed Training Platform (TTP). The development is to enable users to safely fly and control the UAV in real time within a limited (yet unconstrained) virtually created environment. Thus, the paper introduces a hardware virtual environment coupling concept, the Panda3D gaming engine utilization to develop the graphical user interface (GUI) and the 3D-flying environment, as well as the interfacing electronics that enables tracking, monitoring and mapping of real-time movement onto the virtual domain and vice verse. Design/methodology/approach The platform comprises a spring-shuttle assembly fixed to a heavy aluminium base. The spring supports a rotating platform (RP), which is intended to support UAVs. The RP yaw, pitch and roll are measured by an inertial measurement unit, its climb/descend is measured by a low cost infrared proximity sensor and its rotation is measured by a rotary optical encoder. The hardware is coupled to a virtual environment (VE), which was developed using the Panda3D gaming engine. The VE includes a GUI to generate, edit, load and save real-life environments. Hardware manoeuvres are reflected into the VE. Findings The prototype was proven effective in dynamically mapping and tracking the rotating platform movements in the virtual environment. This should not be confused with the hardware in loop approach, which requires the inclusion of a mathematical model of the hardware in a loop. The finding will provide future means of testing navigation and tracking algorithms. Research limitations/implications The work is still new, and there is great room for improvement in many aspects. Here, this paper reports the concept and its technical implementation only. Practical implications In the literature, various testbeds were reported, and it is felt that there is still room to come up with a better design that enables UAV flying in safer and unlimited environments. This has many practical implications, particularly in testing control and navigation algorithms in hazardous fields. Social implications The main social impact is to utilise the concept to develop systems that are capable of autonomous rescue mission navigation in disaster zones. Originality/value The authors are aware that various researchers have developed various testbeds, at different degrees of freedom. Similarly, the authors are also aware that researchers have used game engines to simulate mobile robots or sophisticated equipment (like the VICON Motion Capture System) to measure to perform complex manoeuvres. However, the cost of this kind of equipment is very high, autonomous movements are planned in restricted environments and tested systems are only autonomous in certain setups. However, the idea of mapping the dynamics of an avatar flying object onto a 3D-VE is novel. To improve productivity and rapid prototyping, this paper proposes the use of commercially available game engines, such as the Panda3D, to create virtual environments © Emerald Group Publishing Limited [ISSN 0143-991X].",doi,10.1108/IR-01-2015-0017,Scopus,Industrial Robot,Annaz F.,2015,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas

,Understanding The Interplay Of Model Complexity And Fidelity In Multiagent Systems Via An Evolutionary Framework,"Modern video games come with highly realistic graphics enabling the players to interact with visually rich virtual worlds. Realistic (life-like) animation of nonplayer characters (NPCs) in such virtual worlds is particularly important to enhance the gaming experience. Multiagent systems are one effective approach to synthesize life-like behaviors and interactions by codifying simple rules into NPCs (each NPC as an autonomous agent). However, such behaviors generally come at the cost of increasing computational expense and complexity in terms of aspects such as number of rules and parameters. Therefore, the desire for high fidelity (highly realistic) behaviors is often in conflict with the drive for low complexity. Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms provide a sophisticated mechanism to optimize two or more conflicting objectives simultaneously. However, evolutionary computing techniques need an appropriate objective function to drive the exploration in the correct direction. Pairing of evolutionary techniques and multiagent systems is challenging in the classes of problems in which the fitness is evaluated based on human aesthetic judgment rather than on objective forms of measurements. In this study, we present a multiobjective evolutionary framework to evolve low complexity and high fidelity multiagent systems by utilizing a machine learning system trained by bootstrapping human aesthetic judgment. We have gathered empirical data in three problem areas - simulation of conversational group dynamics, sheepdog herding behaviors, and traffic dynamics, and show the effectiveness of our approach in deriving low complexity and high fidelity multiagent systems. Further, we have identified common properties of the Pareto-optimal frontiers in the three problem areas that can ultimately lead to an understanding of a relationship between simulation model complexity and behavior fidelity. This understanding will be useful in deciding which level of behavioral fidelity is required for the characters in video games based on the distance to the camera, importance to the scene, and available computational resources. © 2009-2012 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TCIAIG.2016.2560882,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games,"Lakshika E., Barlow M., Easton A.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,User Selfishness Vs. File Availability In P2p File-Sharing Systems: Evolutionary Game Theoretic Approach,"In a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) file-sharing system, a node finds and retrieves its desired file. If multiple nodes cache the same file to provide others, we can achieve a dependable file-sharing system with low latency and high file availability. However, a node has to spend costs, e. g., processing load or storage capacity, on caching a file. Consequently, a node may selfishly behave and hesitate to cache a file. In such a case, unpopular files are likely to disappear from the system. In this paper, we aim to reveal whether effective caching in the whole system emerges from autonomous and selfish node behavior. We discuss relationship between selfish node behavior and system dynamics by using evolutionary game theory. Through theoretic analysis, we show that a file-sharing system can be robust to file disappearance depending on a cost and demand model for caching even if nodes behave selfishly. Furthermore, we also conduct several simulation-based analysis in terms of network structures, evolving network, load balancing, and system stability. As a result, we demonstrate that a file-sharing system with good properties, i.e., robustness to file disappearance, low search latency, well load-balancing, and high stability, can be achieved independent of network structures and dynamics. © Springer Science + Business Media, LLC 2009.",doi,10.1007/s12083-009-0045-7,Scopus,Peer-to-Peer Networking and Applications,"Sasabe M., Wakamiya N., Murata M.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas

,Using Direct Competition To Select For Competent Controllers In Evolutionary Robotics,"Evolutionary robotics (ER) is a field of research that applies artificial evolution toward the automatic design and synthesis of intelligent robot controllers. The preceding decade saw numerous advances in evolutionary robotics hardware and software systems. However, the sophistication of resulting robot controllers has remained nearly static over this period of time. Here, we make the case that current methods of controller fitness evaluation are primary factors limiting the further development of ER. To address this, we define a form of fitness evaluation that relies on intra-population competition. In this research, complex neural networks were trained to control robots playing a competitive team game. To limit the amount of human bias or know-how injected into the evolving controllers, selection was based on whether controllers won or lost games. The robots relied on video sensing of their environment, and the neural networks required on the order of 150 inputs. This represents an order of magnitude increase in sensor complexity compared to other research in this field. Evolved controllers were tested extensively in real fully-autonomous robots and in simulation. Results and experiments are presented to characterize the training process and the acquisition of controller competency under different evolutionary conditions. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

For this project, all the MEMS' fabrication steps were adapted to a teaching environment, from its design using specific software, to its experimental characterization after fabrication. The implementation of this learning strategy enhances students' learning autonomy while fostering multidirectional learning and active feedback between teachers and students. This innovative approach allows students to carry out collaborative work in a realistic environment and serves to introduce science students to tools and workflow typical of the engineering field. Although this learning strategy is particularized for students in a Micro-and Nanosystems course of a Physics Bachelor's degree program, it can be adapted to students of any scientific technical degree. © 2015 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TE.2015.2472639,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Education,"Sanchez-Azqueta C., Gimeno C., Celma S., Aldea C.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Valence Weighting As A Predictor Of Emotional Reactivity To A Stressful Situation,"Individuals who have a more adverse reaction to stressful situations are at heightened risk for developing emotional disorders. The current studies aimed to demonstrate that valence biases in attitude generalization relate to individuals' emotional reactivity following a stressful task. Participants played a computer game in which they had to learn whether previously unknown stimuli (i.e., beans) produced positive or negative outcomes. They then had to classify novel stimuli, which varied in resemblance to those employed in the game, as either positive or negative. Attitude generalization, i.e., the extent to which participants weight resemblance to a positive versus negative, is critical to the classification of these novel stimuli, which provided the basis for indexing valence weighting. Participants then completed a stressful anagram task, in which they had three minutes to solve as many anagrams as possible. Half the anagrams were difficult, and half were insoluble, thus creating a failure experience. Mood was assessed before and after the task as a measure of emotional reactivity. In two studies, we observed that for participants initially in a good mood, the extent to which negative attitudes generalized more extensively than positive attitudes was predictive of greater emotional reactivity to the stressful anagram task. © 2012 Guilford Publications, Inc.",doi,10.1521/jscp.2012.31.7.746,Scopus,Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology,"Pietri E.S., Fazio R.H., Shook N.J.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,"Valence, Arousal And Dominance In The Eeg During Game Play","In this paper, we describe our investigation of traces of naturally occurring emotions in electrical brain signals, that can be used to build interfaces that respond to our emotional state. This study confirms a number of known affective correlates in a realistic, uncontrolled environment for the emotions of valence (or pleasure), arousal and dominance: (1) a significant decrease in frontal power in the theta range is found for increasingly positive valence, (2) a significant frontal increase in power in the alpha range is associated with increasing emotional arousal, (3) a significant right posterior power increase in the delta range correlates with increasing arousal and (4) asymmetry in power in the lower alpha bands correlates with self-reported valence. Furthermore, asymmetry in the higher alpha bands correlates with self-reported dominance. These last two effects provide a simple measure for subjective feelings of pleasure and feelings of control.

,Vanishing Scares: Biofeedback Modulation Of Affective Player Experiences In A Procedural Horror Game,"To understand the impact of emotionally driven games on player experience, we developed a procedural horror game (Vanish) capable of run-time level, asset, and event generation. Vanish was augmented to interpret players’ physiological data as a simplified emotional state, mapping it to a set of adaptation rules that modify the player experience. To explore the effects of adaptation mechanisms on player experience, we conducted a mixed-methods study on three different versions of the game, two of which integrated varying biofeedback mechanisms. Players’ affective experiences were objectively measured by analysing physiological data. Additionally, subjective experience was recorded through the use of the Game Experience Questionnaire. Our study confirmed that biofeedback functionality had a statistically significant effect on the ratings of player experience dimensions: immersion, tension, positive affect, and negative affect. Furthermore, participants reported noticeable differences in player experience, favouring the added depth present in the biofeedback-enabled iterations of the game. In the future, these conclusions will help to develop more immersive and engaging player experiences. © 2015, OpenInterface Association.",doi,10.1007/s12193-015-0208-1,Scopus,Journal on Multimodal User Interfaces,"Nogueira P.A., Torres V., Rodrigues R., Oliveira E., Nacke L.E.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Variables Associated With Physical Fighting Among U.s. High-School Students.,"Background Violence among adolescents is an important public health problem in the United States. This study was conducted to estimate the prevalence of having been engaged in physical fighting on school property and associated factors of the behavior among school-going adolescents in the United States. Methods This study was based on secondary analysis of the United States Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) conducted in 2005. The sampling frame included all private and public school in the country, stratified by region and urbanicity based on the US census bureau data. Frequencies and proportions were obtained for the outcome and explanatory variables. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the level of association between explanatory variables and the outcome (having been involved in a physical fight). Results Of the 13,857 respondents, 13.5% (18.2% for males and 8.8% for females) reported physical fighting onschool property in the last 12 months to the survey. Males were more likely to have been in a physical fight than females (OR = 2.23; 95% CI [1.89, 2.63]). Respondents aged 17 years or older were less likely to report physical fighting than those who were 14 years or younger. Compared to Whites, American Indians or Alaska Natives, Blacks, Native Hawaii or other Pacific Islanders, and Hispanics were more likely to report physical fighting on school property (OR = 2.11; 95% CI [1.22, 3.66], OR = 1.72; 95% CI [1.42, 2.0], OR = 2.18; 95% CI [1.01, 4.79], and OR = 1.74; 95% CI [1.41, 2.16] respectively). Physical fighting on school property was also positively associated with cigarette smoking (OR = 1.70; 95% CI [1.37, 2.10]), drinking alcohol (OR = 1.45; 95% CI [1.20, 1.76]), use of illegal drugs (OR = 1.73; 95% CI [1.42, 2.12]), having had property stolen or deliberately damaged on school property (OR = 2.06; 95% CI [1.74, 2.44]), having been threatened or injured with a weapon on school property (OR = 2.63; 95% CI [2.06, 3.34]), and playing videogame three or more hours a day (OR = 1.29; 95% CI [1.07, 1.56]). Conclusion These findings suggest that physical fighting among US High School students is widespread and positively associated with victimization (having been threatened or injured with a weapon on school property) and other risky behaviors such as smoking, alcohol and drugs use. Intervention programs to prevent/control those risky behaviors as well as further attention on the association between physical fighting and victimization at school through longitudinal research are warranted.",doi,10.1186/1745-0179-4-16,anderson2010,Clinical Practice and Epidemiology in Mental Health,"Rudatsikira, E., Muula, A.

,Ventricular Fibrillation Refractory To Icd Therapy,"A 14-year-old boy was admitted for the evaluation of recurrent syncope. His ECG on admission revealed a sinus rhythm with an undetermined QRS axis, T wave inversion at leads V3, V4 and abnormal q at leads I, aVL, V5, and V6. However, no underlying disease could be detected by any morphological examination. Programmed ventricular stimulation also induced no ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation (VF). Only signal-averaged ECG showed ventricular late potential and the cause of syncope was not clarified. As his brother with a similar ECG had died suddenly, he was prophylactically treated with an ICD. However, 14 months later he died suddenly after playing a video game. The ICD recorded VF, which was not converted despite 6 cardioversion attempts by the ICD.

,Video Ethology: Television As A Data Base For Cross-Cultural Studies In Nonverbal Displays,"This demonstration study attempts to indicate how live television programming might provide an economical and easily-accessed source of material for cross-cultural investigation. This study compared the nonverbal displays of emotion for American and Canadian television game show contestants. Results suggested that although Americans and Canadians did not differ significantly in the types of emotions displayed, Americans were rated as being significantly more expressive in their emotional display. In addition, Americans differed from Canadians in their forms of nonverbal display. American females were seen as using their hands more than the Canadian females. American males were seen to smile more than their Canadian counterparts. Discussion explored how methodology introduced in this study could be conveniently expanded to more conclusively explore culturally determined display rules. Consideration of current video cassette technology facilitating this form of investigation was discussed. © 1985 Human Sciences Press.",doi,10.1007/BF00987142,Scopus,Journal of Nonverbal Behavior,Waxer P.H.,1985,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Video Game Playing Increases Food Intake In Adolescents: A Randomized Crossover Study,"Background: Video game playing has been linked to obesity in many observational studies. However, the influence of this sedentary activity on food intake is unknown. Objective: The objective was to examine the acute effects of sedentary video game play on various components of energy balance. Design: With the use of a randomized crossover design, 22 healthy, normal-weight, male adolescents (mean ± SD age: 16.7 ± 1.1 y) completed two 1-h experimental conditions, namely video game play and rest in a sitting position, followed by an ad libitum lunch. The endpoints were spontaneous food intake, energy expenditure, stress markers, appetite sensations, and profiles of appetite-related hormones. Results: Heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, sympathetic tone, and mental workload were significantly higher during the video game play condition than during the resting condition (P < 0.05). Although energy expenditure was significantly higher during video game play than during rest (mean increase over resting: 89 kJ; P < 0.01), ad libitum energy intake after video game play exceeded that measured after rest by 335 kJ (P < 0.05). A daily energy surplus of 682 kJ (163 kcal) over resting (P , 0.01) was observed in the video game play condition. The increase in food intake associated with video game play was observed without increased sensations of hunger and was not compensated for during the rest of the day. Finally, the profiles of glucose, insulin, cortisol, and ghrelin did not suggest an up-regulation of appetite during the video game play condition. Conclusion: A single session of video game play in healthy male adolescents is associated with an increased food intake, regardless of appetite sensations.

,Video Game Playing Time And Cardiometabolic Risk In Adolescents: The Afinos Study.,"We aimed to examine the association of video games playing time with cardiometabolic risk biomarkers in adolescents. This study comprised 181 adolescents (88 girls), aged 13- to 17 years old. Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was measured by accelerometry, and video game playing time in computer and console was self-reported. Waist circumference, systolic blood pressure (BP) and diastolic BP, mean arterial pressure, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, insulin, and apolipoproteins A-1 and B-100 were measured. Computer games use was not significantly associated with any biomarker (P>0.1) but the time spent using console games was positively associated with diastolic BP, mean arterial pressure, triglycerides, and a clustered cardiometabolic risk score. These results were independent of age, sex, pubertal stage, MVPA, and WC. These results support some evidence regarding a plausible unfavorable role of playing (console) video games on cardiometabolic health in adolescence.",doi,10.1016/j.medcli.2012.04.017,pubmed,Medicina clinica,"Martinez-Gómez, David; Gomez-Martinez, Sonia; Ruiz, Jonatan R; Ortega, Francisco B; Marcos, Ascension; Veiga, Oscar L",2013,NA,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Video Game Therapy For Emotional Regulation And Impulsivity Control In A Series Of Treated Cases With Bulimia Nervosa,"Although standard psychological treatments have been successful in treating several core features in eating disorders (ED), other characteristics such as emotional regulation or impulsivity appear to be more resistant to change. There is a growing body of evidence to support the efficacy of cognitive remediation for cognitive and emotional difficulties in ED. Playmancer/ Islands is a video game (VG) designed to specifically treat mental disorders, characterized by problems in impulse control. The objective of the game is to increase self-control over emotions, decision making and behaviours. The aim of this study is to describe the results from a consecutive series of nine bulimia nervosa patients who were treated with the VG in addition to cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT). The outcomes included clinical and psychopathological questionnaires, and physiological measures were obtained during the VG. Emotional regulation improved, heart rate variability increased, and respiratory rate and impulsivity measures reduced after the treatment. These findings suggest that VG training may enhance treatment for ED. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and Eating Disorders Association.

,Video Game Violence And Confederate Gender: Effects On Reward And Punishment Given By College Males.,"We examined reward and punishment behavior amongmale college students (N = 119) following video gameplay. Most participants (N = 96) were White, theremainder (N = 23) were African American; most were from middle- to upper-middle-class backgrounds. Theparticipants played either a nonviolent (NBA Jam) or oneof three levels of a violent (Mortal Kombat) video game.After playing the video game for 15 minutes participants rewarded and punished a male orfemale confederate in a teacher/learner paradigm.Participants rewarded male (but not female) confederateswith significantly more jellybeans under the basketball condition than under any of the martial artsconditions. Participants rewarded confederates moreunder the NBA Jam condition than any of the MortalKombat conditions, but the Mortal Kombat conditions did not differ significantly from one another.Participants punished confederates significantly moreafter playing Mortal Kombat II than after playing NBAJam. While participants were punished more harshly under the Mortal Kombat II condition than theMortal Kombat conditions, these differences were notsignificant. Post hoc analyses showed that females werepunished significantly more stringently as game violence increased, but this finding should beinterpreted with caution.",doi,10.1023/A:1018843304606,anderson2010,Sex Roles,"Ballard, M.

,Video Games And Aggression In Children.,"This study examined the effect of playing an aggressive or nonaggressive video game on fifth-graders' free play. Twenty-two pairs of boys and 20 pairs of girls were randomly assigned to one of three conditions. One of the children in each pair played a video game rated by peers as aggressive, a video game with little aggression, or a non-video maze-solving game for 8 minutes. The other child watched. Each child was then left individually to engage in free play in a separate room for 8 minutes, and also given the opportunity to deliver rewards and punishments to another child. The results were similar for both players and observers. Girls evidenced significantly more general activity and aggressive free play after playing the aggressive video game. Girls' activity decreased and their quiet play slightly increased after playing the low aggressive game compared to the control group. Neither video game had any significant effect on boys' free play. Neither girls nor boys gave significantly more punishments or rewards after playing any of the games.",doi,10.1111/j.1559-1816.1986.tb01755.x,anderson2010,Journal of Applied Social Psychology,"Cooper, J., Mackie, D.",1986,NA,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Video Games And The Political And Cultural Economies Of Health-Entertainment,"Focusing mainly on the company Nintendo, this paper examines the political economic and cultural forces underpinning the video game industry’s recent interest in merging entertainment and health promotion. This is a trend best exemplified in sexagenarian actress Helen Mirren’s endorsement of Nintendo’s fitness-themed game Wii Fit Plus. In one sense, ‘health-entertainment’ is deemed a product of the coercive laws of competition that impress the need for reinvestment and innovation as a way of warding off industry rivals. Nintendo’s turn to health promotion is from this perspective an extension of the ‘console wars’ that in the past drove gaming companies to pursue verisimilitude on screen in hopes of attracting (young male) consumers. In another sense, the present moment offers an ideal time to direct innovation towards the issues of health and healthy ageing in particular, as the cultural logics of healthism and the ‘third age’ both emphasise the virtues of ‘healthy’ and autonomous consumer activity. As such, Nintendo has pursued aesthetic simplicity but kinaesthetic realism as a way of extending the appeal of video gaming beyond the male youth demographic. In examining the implications of these developments, it is argued that health and entertainment, as independent constructs, are conceptually reimagined through their integration with one another. The pursuit of entertainment is made ‘responsible’, thereby remedying the concern that video gaming is an unhealthy activity. The pursuit of health, meanwhile, becomes a matter of playful, technology-enhanced and ultimately consumption-based experience. © 2014 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",doi,10.1080/02614367.2014.986511,Scopus,Leisure Studies,Millington B.,2016,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas

,Violent Video Games Increase Voice Stress: An Experimental Study,"In most violent video games, players are put in stressful situations where enemies are trying to kill them. This is reflected by the results of previous research showing that violent video games increase physiological arousal (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure, galvanic skin response). In this study, I investigate the effect of playing violent video games on emotional stress detected by a new methodology: voice analysis. Because changes and disturbances in vocal responses can be understood as reactions to emotional stress, I expected that violent videogames would increase voice stress. Participants (N 87 French university students; 40% female; Mage 21.2) played either a violent or nonviolent game for 20 min. After game play, participants read a stressprovoking story aloud while their voices were recorded. Voice recordings were analyzed to determine the amount of emotional stress in participants' voices using Automated Voice Stress Analysis. As hypothesized, voice stress was higher among violent video game players than among nonviolent video game players. Voice stress was also higher for men than for women. No interaction between video game content and the gender of participants was observed. This study confirms that violent video games have physiological consequences on players, as predicted by the General Aggression Model and also introduces a promising nonobtrusive physiological measure in media psychology research. © 2015 American Psychological Association.",doi,10.1037/ppm0000083,Scopus,Psychology of Popular Media Culture,Hasan Y.,2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Virtual Patients In A Behavioral Medicine Massive Open Online Course (Mooc): A Qualitative And Quantitative Analysis Of Participants' Perceptions,"Objective: The purpose of this article is to explore learners' perceptions of using virtual patients in a behavioral medicine Massive Open Online Course (MOOCs) and thereby describe innovative ways of disseminating knowledge in health-related areas. Methods: A 5-week MOOC on behavioral medicine was hosted on the edX platform. The authors developed two branched virtual patients consisting of video recordings of a live standardized patient, with multiple clinical decision points and narration unfolding depending on learners' choices. Students interacted with the virtual patients to treat stress and sleep problems. Answers to the exit survey and participant comments from the discussion forum were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. Results: In total, 19,236 participants enrolled in the MOOC, out of which 740 received the final certificate. The virtual patients were completed by 2317 and 1640 participants respectively. Among survey respondents (n = 442), 83.1% agreed that the virtual patient exercise was helpful. The qualitative analysis resulted in themes covering what it was like to work with the virtual patient, with subthemes on learner-centered education, emotions/eustress, game comparisons, what the participants learned, what surprised them, how confident participants felt about applying interventions in practice, suggestions for improvement, and previous experiences of virtual patients. Conclusions: Students were enthusiastic about interacting with the virtual patients as a means to apply new knowledge about behavioral medicine interventions. The most common suggestion was to incorporate more interactive cases with various levels of complexity. Further research should include patient outcomes and focus on interprofessional aspects of learning with virtual patients in a MOOC. © 2017 The Author(s).",doi,10.1007/s40596-017-0706-4,Scopus,Academic Psychiatry,"Berman A.H., Biguet G., Stathakarou N., Westin-Hägglöf B., Jeding K., McGrath C., Zary N., Kononowicz A.A.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Virtual Player Design Using Self-Learning Via Competitive Coevolutionary Algorithms,"The Google Artificial Intelligence (AI) Challenge is an international contest the objective of which is to program the AI in a two-player real time strategy (RTS) game. This AI is an autonomous computer program that governs the actions that one of the two players executes during the game according to the state of play. The entries are evaluated via a competition mechanism consisting of two-player rounds where each entry is tested against others. This paper describes the use of competitive coevolutionary (CC) algorithms for the automatic generation of winning game strategies in Planet Wars, the RTS game associated with the 2010 contest. Three different versions of a prime algorithm have been tested. Their common nexus is not only the use of a Hall-of-Fame (HoF) to keep note of the winners of past coevolutions but also the employment of an archive of experienced players, termed the hall-of-celebrities (HoC), that puts pressure on the optimization process and guides the search to increase the strength of the solutions; their differences come from the periodical updating of the HoF on the basis of quality and diversity metrics. The goal is to optimize the AI by means of a self-learning process guided by coevolutionary search and competitive evaluation. An empirical study on the performance of a number of variants of the proposed algorithms is described and a statistical analysis of the results is conducted. In addition to the attainment of competitive bots we also conclude that the incorporation of the HoC inside the primary algorithm helps to reduce the effects of cycling caused by the use of HoF in CC algorithms. © Springer Science+Business Media 2014.",doi,10.1007/s11047-014-9411-3,Scopus,Natural Computing,"Nogueira Collazo M., Cotta C., Fernández-Leiva A.J.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Virtual Reality System Based On Kinect For The Elderly In Fall Prevention,"BACKGROUND: Daily life movements require balance ability. Good balance control is closely related to body stability and its development. Therefore, balance training is necessary for any age group. OBJECTIVE: This study proposes the combination of Kinect and virtual reality to build an information platform of interactive scenarios, for practice and evaluation of balance ability. Real-time monitoring of SpO2, pulse rate, velocity and reaction time during the training process is presented for the training activities of elderly physical function. METHODS: Based on the indicators of balance ability, this information platform sets out various training activities to improve balance ability, making the supposedly tedious process fun and vivid and leading to much better training results. RESULTS: The data (SpO2, pulse rate, velocity, reaction time) collected from this platform can be sorted and analysed, and the results used to evaluate the performance of balance training, and referenced for follow-up planning in the future. The real-time pulse rate and SpO2 measurement information indicating the training activities for the elderly to maintain physical function has a positive significance. A noninvasive and unconstrained real-time method to detect the pulse rate and SpO2 during exercises is presented. The results of balance assessment scale testing of BBS and TUG for the experimental group show that effective balance really improved. The difference between the experimental group and the control group was achieved by using paired t-test. The data were analysed by the descriptive statistics on significant level of P &lt; 0.01. CONCLUSIONS: From the training results of the participants, we know that the information platform developed for enhancing balance ability is in line with practical needs. Furthermore, the fun and interesting game-like exercises it introduces are very helpful in improving balance ability, and certainly in preventing falls. © 2014 - IOS Press and the authors.",doi,10.3233/THC-130769,Scopus,Technology and Health Care,"Hsieh W.-M., Chen C.-C., Wang S.-C., Tan S.-Y., Hwang Y.-S., Chen S.-C., Lai J.-S., Chen Y.-L.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas

,"Virtually Driving: Are The Driving Environments ""Real Enough"" For Exposure Therapy With Accident Victims? An Explorative Study","There is a small but growing body of research supporting the effectiveness of computer-generated environments in exposure therapy for driving phobia. However, research also suggests that difficulties can readily arise whereby patients do not immerse in simulated driving scenes. The simulated driving environments are not ""real enough"" to undertake exposure therapy. This sets a limitation to the use of virtual reality (VR) exposure therapy as a treatment modality for driving phobia. The aim of this study was to investigate if a clinically acceptable immersion/presence rate of >80% could be achieved for driving phobia subjects in computer generated environments by modifying external factors in the driving environment. Eleven patients referred from the Accident and Emergency Department of a general hospital or from their General Practitioner following a motor vehicle accident, who met DSM-IV criteria for Specific Phobia-driving were exposed to a computer-generated driving environment using computer driving games (London Racer/Midtown Madness). In an attempt to make the driving environments ""real enough,"" external factors were modified by (a) projection of images onto a large screen, (b) viewing the scene through a windscreen, (c) using car seats for both driver and passenger, and (d) increasing vibration sense through use of more powerful subwoofers. Patients undertook a trial session involving driving through computer environments with graded risk of an accident. ""Immersion/presence"" was operationally defined as a subjective rating by the subject that the environment ""feels real,"" together with an increase in subjective units of distress (SUD) ratings of >3 and/or an increase of heart rate of >15 beats per minute (BPM). Ten of 11 (91%) of the driving phobic subjects met the criteria for immersion/presence in the driving environment enabling progression to VR exposure therapy. These provisional findings suggest that the paradigm adopted in this study might be an effective and relatively inexpensive means of developing driving environments ""real enough,"" to make VR exposure therapy a viable treatment modality for driving phobia following a motor vehicle accident (MVA). © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",doi,10.1089/cpb.2005.8.532,Scopus,Cyberpsychology and Behavior,"Walshe D., Lewis E., O'Sullivan K., Kim S.I.",2005,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Webcam-Based Detection Of Emotional States,"Game designers have to deal with the complex task of monitoring the emotional state of players in games. There are different elements with the game, which effect the player’s emotional status. Since the game play experience occurs almost unconsciously, traditional methods such as think aloud may disrupt the playing experience, thus skewing the results obtained. Other methods include fitting cables and electrodes to the player to monitor biological information. Although such devices can offer significant accurate results, they are not commonly found and may cause discomfort while playing games. Because of this, we propose a webcam-based heart rate monitoring method that can be used to predict the player’s emotional state. We first analyzed the change in heart rate with respect to the players emotional state. This allowed us to find a correlation between emotional states, such as frustration, fun, challenge, and boredom. The second objective was to create a webcam-based method to monitor the heart rate. This was performed by extracting the RGB channels from the face region and then retrieving the underlying components using a dimensionality-reduction method. The results obtained from the webcam-based method were far from perfect, but this was expected, since we were performing the tests under realistic conditions. The last objective was to predict the player’s emotional state using the heart rate obtained from the webcam-based method. The accuracy of the prediction was up to 76 %, which exceeded our initial aim. This system will be implemented in Unity 3D to make its integration and adoption easier. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",doi,10.1007/s00371-016-1309-x,Scopus,Visual Computer,"Dingli A., Giordimaina A.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Weighting Positive Versus Negative: The Fundamental Nature Of Valence Asymmetry,"Objective: The relation between weighting of valence information in attitude generalization and evaluation of novel/hypothetical situations was explored. Method: Undergraduate participants played a computer game requiring them to learn which stimuli (beans) would increase/decrease their points. Later, participants classified the valence of game beans and novel ones varying in resemblance to game beans. The weighting bias in attitude generalization was estimated as the average response to novel beans, controlling for game bean learning. We examined whether this bias related to judgments of hypothetical situations concerning interpersonal relationships (Study 1), threat assessment (Study 2), risk propensities (Study 3), and risk behavior (Study 6). We also assessed whether valence weighting is specifically predictive of novel situations (Studies 4 and 5). Finally, we explored participants' ability to self-report their weighting bias (Study 7). Results: Valence weighting in attitude generalization was related to judgments of novel situations and risk behavior. The performance-based measure did not correlate with responses to various questionnaires related to valence weighting. Conclusions: There is a fundamental individual difference associated with valence weighting, resulting in the relation between two processes unrelated in content, but sharing the essential characteristic of valence weighting-attitude generalization and evaluation of novel situations. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",doi,10.1111/j.1467-6494.2012.00800.x,Scopus,Journal of Personality,"Pietri E.S., Fazio R.H., Shook N.J.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,What Hispanic Parents Do To Encourage And Discourage 3-5 Year Old Children To Be Active: A Qualitative Study Using Nominal Group Technique,"Purpose: Hispanic preschoolers are less active than their non-Hispanic peers. As part of a feasibility study to assess environmental and parenting influences on preschooler physical activity (PA) (Niños Activos), the aim of this study was to identify what parents do to encourage or discourage PA among Hispanic 3-5 year old children to inform the development of a new PA parenting practice instrument and future interventions to increase PA among Hispanic youth. Methods: Nominal Group Technique (NGT), a structured multi-step group procedure, was used to elicit and prioritize responses from 10 groups of Hispanic parents regarding what parents do to encourage (5 groups) or discourage (5 groups) preschool aged children to be active. Five groups consisted of parents with low education (less than high school) and 5 with high education (high school or greater) distributed between the two NGT questions. Results: Ten NGT groups (n = 74, range 4-11/group) generated 20-46 and 42-69 responses/group for practices that encourage or discourage PA respectively. Eight to 18 responses/group were elected as the most likely to encourage or discourage PA. Parental engagement in child activities, modeling PA, and feeding the child well were identified as parenting practices that encourage child PA. Allowing TV and videogame use, psychological control, physical or emotional abuse, and lack of parental engagement emerged as parenting practices that discourage children from being active. There were few differences in the pattern of responses by education level.Conclusions: Parents identified ways they encourage and discourage 3-5 year-olds from PA, suggesting both are important targets for interventions. These will inform the development of a new PA parenting practice scale to be further evaluated. Further research should explore the role parents play in discouraging child PA, especially in using psychological control or submitting children to abuse, which were new findings in this study. © 2013 O'Connor et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",doi,10.1186/1479-5868-10-93,Scopus,International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity,"O'Connor T.M., Cerin E., Hughes S.O., Robles J., Thompson D., Baranowski T., Lee R.E., Nicklas T., Shewchuk R.M.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,When To Measure Resting Values In Studies Of Children's Cardiovascular Reactivity,"Investigations suggesting that the order of obtaining resting and cardiovascular reactivity measurements moderates values have provided inconsistent results and have not analyzed data from children; the generalizability of results is uncertain. In this investigation, all children enrolled in the eighth-grade classrooms of the public schools of an entire county (n=451) participated in standardized reactivity assessments. The order of resting and reactivity measurements was randomized by examination day (a total of 19 days). Analyses indicated that all comparisons of order effects on mean resting blood pressure and heart rate, as well as reactivity (both change from resting and absolute values and both mean and maximal values), were nonsignificant. Results indicate that measurement order is not always a necessary consideration in studies of reactivity; the conditions under which measurement order is a consideration requires clarification. © 1994 Plenum Publishing Corporation.",doi,10.1007/BF01857922,Scopus,Journal of Behavioral Medicine,"Murphy J.K., Alpert B.S., Walker S.S.",1994,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas

,'Resting Toucher': A Time And Motion Analysis Of Elite Lawn Bowls.,"Whilst numerous investigations have explored the physical demands placed upon competitive sportspeople from a wide array of sports little is known about the physical demands placed on lawn bowlers. The purpose of this study was to ascertain the movement activities of Australian representative singles and pairs players and to determine the frequency and duration of these activities. One match each of two male and two female players (one singles and one pairs player per gender) were videotaped during an international tournament. During playback of the videotaped matches (n = 4), a single observer coded the players' activities into five distinct categories (waiting, walking forward, walking backward, jogging and bowling) using a computerised video editing system (Gamebreaker™ Digital Video Analysis System). Field calibration of players over 30m for forward motions and 15m for the backward motion was performed to allow for the estimation of total distance covered during the match. Heart rate was monitored during each match. The duration of a match was found to be (mean ± SD) 1hr 28 ± 15mins. The total distance covered during each match was 2093 ± 276m. The mean percentage of match time spent in each motion was: waiting, 61.8 ± 9.3%; walking forward, 22.3 ± 5.6%; walking backward, 2.0 ± 0.4%; jogging, 1.1 ± 0.5%; and bowling, 8.5 ± 4.2%. Average heart rate was found to be 57 ± 7% of age-predicted HRmax with a maximum of 78 ± 9% of age-predicted HRmax. The results of this study suggest that playing lawn bowls at an international level requires light-moderate intensity activity similar to that reported for golf. Key PointsThe duration of a lawn bowls match played in sets play was 1hr 28 ± 15mins.The majority (65%) of this time was spent in the motion category ""waiting"".Players covered more than 2000m during a match with the vast majority (85%) in the form of forward walking.The average heart rate was 107 ± 15 bpm or 57 ± 7% of age-predicted HRmax.The game of lawn bowls requires light-moderate intensity activity and appears to be similar to the physical demands of golf.",pmid,24357953,pubmed,Journal of sports science &amp; medicine,"Silk, Aaron J; Hammond, John; Weatherby, Robert P",2013,NA,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,[Comparative Studies On Influences Of Physical And Psychological Strain On The Ecg In Coronary Disease Patients].,"In 7 patients suffering from heart infarction the electrocardiogram was telemetrically registered during telecast of the world championship in football 1974. The same patients were tested on a bicycle ergometer with standardized loads of 50, 75, 100 and 125 Watt for 3 minutes. Heart rate under psychial strain did not exceed the rate of 50 Watt on bicycle ergometer. Only 1 patient showed some extrasystoles during ergometry. Looking at television all patients developed extrasystoles, in one case 122. If the FRG took part in the game, ventricular extrasystoles were two times, auricular extrasystoles were four times more frequent than during games between foreign countries. It is concluded that psychical strain is able to produce dangerous arrhythmias in patients suffering from coronary heart disease.

,A Tyrosine Hydroxylase Microsatellite And Hemodynamic Response To Stress In A Multi-Ethnic Sample Of Youth,"Objective: Behavioral stress is believed to have an impact on cardiovascular health. As the rate-limiting enzyme in the pathway for catecholamine synthesis, tyrosine hydroxylase is a candidate gene for variability in cardiovascular function. The aim of this study was to determine whether a relationship exists between a tyrosine hydroxylase microsatellite and resting hemodynamic function, and/or hemodynamic responsivity to laboratory stress. Design: Subjects underwent 2 laboratory stressors: a video game challenge and a social competence interview. Setting: The stressors were administered in a laboratory setting. Participants: Subjects were 292 10- to 20-year-old normotensive African-American and European-American twin pairs. Main Outcome Measures: Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were measured at rest and in response to the stressors. Results: Chi-square analyses using re-sampling to account for the twin design indicated that allele and genotype frequencies were significantly different between European Americans and African Americans (P≤.0001). Analyses of variance indicated that the 184 and 199 bp alleles were associated with an attenuation of the hemodynamic response to stress with increasing age (P≤.003, P≤.002, respectively), while the 188 bp allele was associated with a higher resting systolic blood pressure (SBP) (P≤.02), and greater hemodynamic response to stress with increasing BMI (P≤.02). Conclusions: This study showed that in a multi-ethnic sample of normotensive adolescents, specific alleles of this tyrosine hydroxylase microsatellite were associated with protective or deleterious cardiovascular effects with subjects at rest and responding to stress.",pmid,12785414,Scopus,Ethnicity and Disease,"Barbeau P., Litaker M.S., Jackson R.W., Treiber F.A.",2003,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Analysis Of 12-Lead Electrocardiogram In Top Competitive Professional Athletes In The Light Of Recent Guidelines,"Background: One of the most important aims of modern sports cardiology is prevention of sudden cardiac death among athletes. Adequate pre-participation screening is a crucial part of prevention, however, current ACC, AHA or ESC guidelines are not uniform in this context. There is recently ongoing discussion on implementation of 12-lead ECG to the screening protocol. Aim: To assess the prevalence of alterations of resting 12-lead ECG in a population of top-level professional athletes - members of the Polish Olympic Team - using recently accepted criteria. Methods: During the period of intensive training before the Summer Olympic Games in Beijing (2008), a 12-lead, resting ECG was performed in 73 members (20 women and 53 men) of the Polish Olympic Team. Commonly accepted criteria were used to assess the ECG, and alterations were divided into two groups according to recent publications: group I - 'benign', common - thought to be consistent with the athlete's heart syndrome (i.e.: sinus bradycardia, 1st degree atrioventricular block, early repolarisation, right bundle branch hemiblock, isolated signs of left ventricular hypertrophy); and group II - 'suspected', uncommon - which may occur due to organic heart disease (i.e. complete bundle branch block, ventricular arrhythmia, inverse T wave or pathological QRS axis deviation). Results: Completely normal ECG was present in 11% of those examined, common (group I) findings were observed in 65% and 'suspected' (group II) in 23%. The most commonly occurring 'benign' findings were bradycardia incomplete, right bundle branch block and isolated left ventricular hypertrophy, found in 75, 71 and 41%, respectively. From 'suspected' (group II) the most frequent was left posterior fascicular hemiblock, present in 10% of those examined; other findings were complete right bundle branch block, left atrial hypertrophy, inverse T waves and left anterior fascicular hemiblock in single cases. Conclusions: 1. Most of the observed alterations in resting ECG of professional athletes belong to the 'common' group and result from adaptation to exercise. 2. Frequent occurrence of left posterior fascicular hemiblock, which is thought to be 'potentially malignant', requires further investigation.",pmid,20017075,Scopus,Kardiologia Polska,"Światowiec A., Król W., Kuch M., Braksator W., Krysztofiak H., Dłuzniewski M., Mamcarz A.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Association Of Autonomic Nervous System And Eeg Scalp Potential During Playing 2D Grand Turismo 5.,"Cerebral activation and autonomic nervous system have importance in studies such as mental stress. The aim of this study is to analyze variations in EEG scalp potential which may influence autonomic activation of heart while playing video games. Ten healthy participants were recruited in this study. Electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals were measured simultaneously during playing video game and rest conditions. Sympathetic and parasympathetic innervations of heart were evaluated from heart rate variability (HRV), derived from the ECG. Scalp potential was measured by the EEG. The results showed a significant upsurge in the value theta Fz/alpha Pz (p&#60;0.001) while playing game. The results also showed tachycardia while playing video game as compared to rest condition (p&#60;0.005). Normalized low frequency power and ratio of low frequency/high frequency power were significantly increased while playing video game and normalized high frequency power sank during video games.

,Development Of Computer Games For Assessment And Training In Post-Stroke Arm Telerehabilitation.,"Stroke is the leading cause of long term disability among adults in industrialized nations. The majority of these disabilities include deficiencies in arm function, which can make independent living very difficult. Research shows that better results in rehabilitation are obtained when patients receive more intensive therapy. However this intensive therapy is currently too expensive to be provided by the public health system, and at home few patients perform the repetitive exercises recommended by their therapists. Computer games can provide an affordable, enjoyable, and effective way to intensify treatment, while keeping the patient as well as their therapists informed about their progress.

,"Effects Of Vdt Tasks With A Bright Display At Night On Melatonin, Core Temperature, Heart Rate, And Sleepiness","The effects of performing video display terminal (VDT) tasks with a bright display (BD) at night on nocturnal salivary melatonin concentration, rectal temperature, heart rate, and sleepiness were examined. Seven healthy male adults performed exciting VDT tasks with a BD and a dark display (DD) and boring VDT tasks with a BD and a DD from 2300 to 0200. The light intensities of the BD and DD were 45 and 15 lx at each subject's eye level, respectively. The exciting VDT task with both BD and DD significantly suppressed the nocturnal decrease in rectal temperature and heart rate and the nocturnal increase in sleepiness. The BD significantly suppressed the nocturnal decrease in rectal temperature during both exciting and boring VDT tasks. The nocturnal salivary melatonin concentration was significantly suppressed by the combination of the exciting task and BD. The results suggest that performing an exciting VDT task with a BD suppresses the nocturnal changes in melatonin concentration and other physiological indicators of human biological clocks.",pmid,12533495,Scopus,Journal of Applied Physiology,"Higuchi S., Motohashi Y., Liu Y., Ahara M., Kaneko Y.",2003,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Emotlab: Software For Studying Emotional Signaling In Economic Bargaining Games,"EMOTLAB software creates a virtual social environment in which individuals interact via computer with a virtual interaction partner in a series of economic bargaining games. The virtual partner appears on the participant's computer screen as a digital image (e.g., video or picture file) during each trial. A key feature of EMOTLAB software is its ability to control both the strategic behavior and the emotion signaling behavior (e.g., anger vs. embarrassment) of the virtual interaction partner. By simply editing a series of text files that control the subroutines governing the different features of the experiment (payoff structure, number of trials, etc.), EMOTLAB can generate an essentially infinite number of different social bargaining situations in which participants earn monetary payoffs contingent upon their decisions. This paper provides an overview of this software and how one can edit various subroutines to generate a typical experimental session in which research participants encounter a virtual interaction partner who displays different emotional signals.

,Experimental Models For Aggression And Inventories For The Assessment Of Aggressive And Autoaggressive Behavior,"This paper reviews principles realized in questionnaires for the assessment of aggression as well as in experimental models suitable for inducing aggression for the validation of questionnaire scales and for providing experimental models for testing aggression-reducing drug effects. Existing self-rating scales based on factor analysis were shown to measure certain parameters of reactions concerning modes of expression of aggression and its objects. In observer rating scales situations are usually also specified. This paper presents a newly developed questionnaire which combines reactions and situations in order to test specificity. A final scale containing 9 situations and 17 reactions grouped into seven factors is presented. It could be shown to differentiate between certain types of aggression provoking situations. Furthermore, models suitable for eliciting aggression were developed in three different departments of psychology. They are based on frustration by blockade of goals and critique or subtraction of positive reinforcers ('Tower of Hanoi' and 'Superball Game' in Wurzburg, 'Unsolvable Maze Computer Task' in Berlin) and by a competitive condition combined with application of aversive stimuli by a coplayer ('Modified Buss Machine' in Giessen). All experimental conditions were suitable for inducing anger and emotional arousal, negative ratings of confederates or experimenters, and partly also physiological changes. The results seem promising enough to test the relationship between artificially induced aggression and pathologiocal aggression in further research.",pmid,8614702,Scopus,Pharmacopsychiatry,"Netter P., Janke W., Erdmann G.",1995,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Gender Differences In Patterns Of Dynamic Cardiovascular Regulation,"The purpose of this research was to examine the role of gender in hemodynamic response patterns to stress.Sixty-four male and 55 female young adults were administered a protocol of rest, mental arithmetic, video game, and anger recall interview while blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac impedance measures were obtained. Men had higher levels of systolic blood pressure and cardiac output and greater reactivity to tasks, indexed by increases in cardiac output and diastolic blood pressure. Extreme groups of myocardial and vascular reactors were formed from cardiac output and total peripheral resistance change scores during mental arithmetic. The myocardial reactors exhibited greater sensitivity to task demands, whereas vascular reactors exhibited comparable total peripheral resistance increases to all tasks. Vascular reactors exhibited greater diastolic blood pressure reactivity than myocardial reactors. Future studies should address the predictive validity of these reactor patterns for the subsequent development of coronary heart disease. © 1995 by American Psychosomatic Society.",pmid,7480565,Scopus,Psychosomatic Medicine,"Lawler K.A., Wilcox Z.C., Anderson S.F.",1995,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,"Health Maintenance In School-Aged Children: Part I. History, Physical Examination, Screening, And Immunizations","The goals of the well-child examination in school-aged children (kindergarten through early adolescence) are promoting health, detecting disease, and counseling to prevent injury and future health problems. A complete history should address any concerns from the patient and family and screen for lifestyle habits, including diet, physical activity, daily screen time (e.g., television, computer, video games), hours of sleep per night, dental care, and safety habits. School performance can be used for developmental surveillance. A full physical examination should be performed; however, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends against routine scoliosis screening and testicular examination. Children should be screened for obesity, which is defined as a body mass index at or above the 95th percentile for age and sex, and resources for comprehensive, intensive behavioral interventions should be provided to children with obesity. Although the evidence is mixed regarding screening for hypertension before 18 years of age, many experts recommend checking blood pressure annually beginning at three years of age. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends vision and hearing screening annually or every two years in school-aged children. There is insufficient evidence to recommend screening for dyslipidemia in children of any age, or screening for depression before 12 years of age. All children should receive at least 400 IU of vitamin D daily, with higher doses indicated in children with vitamin D deficiency. Children who live in areas with inadequate fluoride in the water (less than 0.6 ppm) should receive a daily fluoride supplement.

,"Immediate Effects Of Labetalol On Central, Splanchnic-Hepatic, And Forearm Haemodynamics During Pleasant Emotional Stress In Hypertensive Patients.","The effects of intravenous administration of labetalol in a dose of 0.75 mg/kg body weight on central, splanchnic-hepatic and forearm haemodynamics were studied in 8 hypertensive patients resting in the supine position and during pleasant psychic stress induced by practice of a television-game of tennis. In the resting state labetalol caused immediate reduction of arterial blood pressures and of total vascular resistance, whereas heart rate, cardiac output and splanchnic-hepatic and forearm blood flow remained unchanged. After labetalol, the stress-induced increase in heart rate, cardiac output, estimated myocardial oxygen demand and forearm blood flow was significantly reduced, whereas total vascular resistance and splanchnic-hepatic vascular resistance remained unchanged. This is taken to indicate that the alpha-adrenoceptor blocking properties of labetalol may offer haemodynamic advantages as compared to the widely used non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents in the management of hypertension.",pmid,7433341,Scopus,Postgraduate Medical Journal,"Trap-Jensen J., Clausen J.P., Hartling O.J., Svendsen T.L., Krogsgaard A.R.",1980,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Individual Alpha Frequency (Iaf) Based Quantitative Eeg Correlates Of Psychological Stress,"Objectives: To explore the EEG changes associated with psychological stress state. Methods: The study was conducted on 34 healthy male student volunteers. The intervention consisted of psychological stress, which was induced by asking the participants to play a pre-decided stressful computer game. Physiological markers of psychological stress were assessed using galvanic skin response (GSR) and heart rate (HR). Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded from 19 scalp locations according to 10- 20 international system of electrode placement. Results: Computer game served as model of lab stressor and was associated with a significant increase in physiological markers (GSR & heart rate) of stress response. Psychological stress was associated with increased absolute power in theta, lower 1 alpha and gamma bands & decreased power in upper alpha and beta bands. Lower 2 alpha band power remained unchanged. Conclusions: Certain types of computer games serve as a model of lab stressor and are associated with physiological and psychological stress and have unique electroencephalographic correlates. The EEG correlates of mental stress are unique superimposed pattern of various cognitive domains.

,Individual Differences In Heart Rate And Peripheral Vascular Responses To An Extended Aversive Task.,"Psychophysiological research on situations requiring active coping has to this point dealt primarily with cardiac responses. Recent studies of vascular responses to such stressors have found conditions in high cardiac reactors that are possible precursors to autoregulatory vasoconstriction. The present study exposed 32 healthy male undergraduates to a one-hour shock avoidance procedure, with avoidance made contingent on video-game performance. Subjects also participated in a separate counterbalanced baseline session. The relationships among individual differences in heart rate, forearm blood flow, forearm vascular resistance, and digital blood volume pulse responses at different points in the stress session were examined. Decreases in forearm vascular resistance were observed only among high and medium heart rate reactors. As the session progressed, however, forearm vascular resistance responses of the medium heart rate reactors were sustained whereas those of the high heart rate reactors habituated despite the fact that heart rate and forearm blood flow responses remained elevated. The potential implications of this pattern of results to an autoregulation theory of hypertension development are discussed. Heart rate reactivity was inversely related to performance on the video-game task but was unrelated to Type A or anxiety.",pmid,2616699,pubmed,Psychophysiology,"Miller, S B; Ditto, B",1990,NA,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Influence Of Fatigue On Tackling Technique In Rugby League Players,"This study investigated the influence of fatigue on tackling technique in rugby league players and determined the relationship between selected physiological capacities and fatigue-induced decrements in tackling technique. Eight rugby league players underwent a standardized one-on-one tackling drill in a 10-m grid. Players performed the one-on-one tackling drill before strenuous exercise and following game-specific repeated-effort exercise of progressively increasing intensities (corresponding to moderate, heavy, and very heavy intensity) in order to induce fatigue that was representative of match conditions. Video footage was taken from the rear, side, and front of the defending player. Tackling technique was objectively assessed using standardized technical criteria. In addition, all players underwent measurements of standard anthropometry (height, body mass, and sum of 7 skinfold measurements), speed (10-, 20-, and 40-m sprint), muscular power (vertical jump), agility (L run), and estimated maximal aerobic power (V̇o2max multistage fitness test). A progressive increase in total repeated-effort time, heart rate, blood lactate concentration, and ratings of perceived exertion occurred throughout the repeated-effort protocol, demonstrating a progressive increase in intensity and fatigue. Fatigue resulted in progressive reductions in tackling technique. Players with the best tackling technique in a nonfatigued state demonstrated the greatest decrement in tackling technique under fatigued conditions. In addition, a significant association was observed between estimated V̇o 2max (r= -0.62) and agility (r= 0.68) and fatigue-induced decrements in tackling technique. From a practical perspective, these findings suggest that strength and conditioning programs designed to develop endurance, change of direction speed, and anticipation skills may reduce fatigue-induced decrements in tackling technique. Furthermore, any defensive drills designed to improve tackling technique should be performed before and under fatigue. © 2008 National Strength and Conditioning Association.",pmid,18550983,Scopus,Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research,Gabbett T.J.,2008,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Match Analysis And Temporal Patterns Of Fatigue In Rugby Sevens,"Granatelli, G, Gabbett, TJ, Briotti, G, Padulo, J, Buglione, A, D'Ottavio, S, and Ruscello, BM. Match analysis and temporal patterns of fatigue in rugby sevens. J Strength Cond Res 28 (3): 728-734, 2014-Rugby sevens is a rapidly growing sport. Match analysis is increasingly being used by sport scientists and coaches to improve the understanding of the physical demands of this sport. This study investigated the physical and physiological demands of elite men's rugby sevens, with special reference to the temporal patterns of fatigue during match play. Nine players, 4 backs and 5 forwards (age 25.1 6 3.1 years) participated during 2 ""Roma 7s"" international tournaments (2010 and 2011). All the players were at the professional level in the highest Italian rugby union, and 5 of these players also competed at the international level. During the matches (n = 15), the players were filmed to assess game performance. Global positioning system, heart rate (HR), and blood lactate (BLa) concentration data were measured and analyzed. The mean total distance covered throughout matches was 1,221 ± 118 m (first half = 643 ± 70 m and second half = 578 ± 77 m; with a decrease of 11.2%, p ≥ 0.05, Effect Size [ES] = 0.29). The players achieved 88.3 ± 4.2 and 87.7 ± 3.4% of the HRmax during the first and second halves, respectively. The BLa for the first and second halves was 3.9 ± 0.9 and 11.2 ± 1.4 mmol.L -1, respectively. The decreases in performance occurred consistently in the final 3 minutes of the matches (240.5% in the distance covered per minute). The difference found in relation to the playing position, although not statistically significant (p = 0.11), showed a large ES (n2 = 0.20), suggesting possible practical implications. These results demonstrate that rugby sevens is a demanding sport that places stress on both the anaerobic glycolytic and aerobic oxidative energy systems. Strength and conditioning programs designed to train these energy pathways may prevent fatigue-induced reductions in physical performance. © 2014 National Strength and Conditioning Association.",pmid,23722109,Scopus,Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research,"Granatelli G., Gabbett T.J., Briotti G., Padulo J., Buglione A., D'ottavio S., Ruscello B.M.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Metabolic Demands Of Match Performance In Young Soccer Players.,"The aim of the present study was to determine metabolic responses, movement patterns and distance covered at running speeds corresponding to fixed blood lactate concentrations (FBLs) in young soccer players during a match play. A further aim of the study was to evaluate the relationships between FBLs, maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) and distance covered during a game. A multistage field test was administered to 32 players to determine FBLs and VO2max. Blood lactate (LA), heart rate (HR) and rate of perceived exertion (RPE) responses were obtained from 36 players during tournament matches filmed using six fixed cameras. Images were transferred to a computer, for calibration and synchronization. In all players, values for LA and HR were higher and RPE lower during the 1(st) half compared to the 2(nd) half of the matches (p < 0.01). Players in forward positions had higher LA levels than defenders, but HR and RPE values were similar between playing positions. Total distance and distance covered in jogging, low-moderate-high intensity running and low intensity sprint were higher during the 1(st) half (p < 0.01). In the 1(st) half, players also ran longer distances at FBLs [p<0.01; average running speed at 2mmol·L(-1) (FBL2): 3.32 ± 0.31m·s(-1) and average running speed at 4mmol·L(-1) (FBL4): 3.91 ± 0.25m·s(-1)]. There was a significant difference between playing positions in distance covered at different running speeds (p < 0.05). However, when distance covered was expressed as FBLs, the players ran similar distances. In addition, relationships between FBLs and total distance covered were significant (r = 0.482 to 0.570; p < 0.01). In conclusion, these findings demonstrated that young soccer players experienced higher internal load during the 1(st) half of a game compared to the 2(nd) half. Furthermore, although movement patterns of players differed between playing positions, all players experienced a similar physiological stress throughout the game. Finally, total distance covered was associated to fixed blood lactate concentrations during play. Key pointsBased on LA, HR and RPE responses, young top soccer players experienced a higher physiological stress during the 1(st) half of the matches compared to the 2(nd) half.Movement patterns differed in accordance with the players' positions but that all players experienced a similar physiological stress during match play.Approximately one quarter of total distance was covered at speeds that exceeded the 4 mmol·L(-1) fixed LA threshold.Total distance covered was influenced by running speeds at fixed lactate concentrations in young soccer players during match play.",pmid,24149134,pubmed,Journal of sports science &amp; medicine,"Aslan, Alper; Acikada, Caner; Güvenç, Alpay; Gören, Hasan; Hazir, Tahir; Ozkara, Asaf",2013,NA,NA,reviewer1,Andreas

Innovations made here are: (1) a design for a generic simulator package for promoting health behavior shifts, and (2) algorithms for animated pedagogical agents to reason about how their emotional state ties to patient condition and user progress. Initial results show that users of the game exhibit a significant shift in intention to call 9-1-1 and avoid delay, that multi-media versions of the game foster vividness and memory retention as well as a better understanding of both symptoms and of the need to manage time during a heart attack event. Also, results provide insight into areas where emotive pedagogical agents help and hinder user performance. Finally, we conclude with next steps that will help improve the game and the field of pedagogical agents and tools for simulated worlds for healthcare education and promotion. © 2001 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",pmid,11519847,Scopus,Health Care Management Science,"Silverman B.G., Holmes J., Kimmel S., Branas C., Ivins D., Weaver R., Chen Y.I.",2001,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Modernization In The Samoas And Children's Reactivity: A Pilot Study,"This investigation studied the potential effects of societal modernization on Samoan children's blood pressure and heart rate reactivity to a standardized television video game procedure. Ethnic Samoan children were sampled from Western Samoa (N = 72), a relatively underdeveloped country with a largely agricultural economy, and American Samoa (N = 70), a territory of the United States that has undergone substantial modernization due to recent economic aid. Results indicated that Western Samoans demonstrated significantly greater systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate reactivity than American Samoans. These data, in conjunction with previous data, suggest that the hemodynamic effects of an acute stressor are inversely associated with societal modernization and an individual's adoption of a lifestyle reflecting integration into a modernized society. Further work is needed to examine the implications of this hypothesis and the associations among concrete measures of modernization and children's cardiovascular risk.",pmid,7809338,Scopus,Psychosomatic Medicine,"Murphy J.K., McGarvey S.T.",1994,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,"Neuroscience, Virtual Reality And Neurorehabilitation: Brain Repair As A Validation Of Brain Theory.","This paper argues that basing cybertherapy approaches on a theoretical understanding of the brain has advantages. On one hand it provides for a rational approach towards therapy design while on the other allowing for a direct validation of brain theory in the clinic. As an example this paper discusses how the Distributed Adaptive Control architecture, a theory of mind, brain and action, has given rise to a new paradigm in neurorehabilitation called the Rehabilitation Gaming System (RGS) and to novel neuroprosthetic systems. The neuroprosthetic system considered is developed to replace the function of cerebellar micro-circuits, expresses core aspects of the learning systems of DAC and has been successfully tested in in-vivo experiments. The Virtual reality based rehabilitation paradigm of RGS has been validated in the treatment of acute and chronic stroke and has been shown to be more effective than existing methods. RGS provides a foundation for integrated at-home therapy systems that can operate largely autonomously when also augmented with appropriate physiological monitoring and diagnostic devices. These examples provide first steps towards a science based medicine.",pmid,22254789,Scopus,Conference proceedings : ...

,Predictors Of Differences Between Type A And B Individuals In Heart Rate And Blood Pressure Reactivity,"Past estimates of the magnitude of Type A-B differences in cardiovascular reactivity are probably overly conservative. In addition, it is unclear which situations are more likely to elicit excessive reactivity in Type As. The present meta-analysis found that, overall, Type As had greater heart rate (mean d =.22), diastolic blood pressure (d =.22), and especially systolic blood pressure responses (d =.33) than Type Bs; these effect sizes were small but relatively consistent. However, Type As showed especially greater cardiovascular reactivity in situations characterized as having (a) positive or negative feedback evaluation, (b) socially aversive elements such as verbal harassment or criticism, and (c) elements inherent in playing video games. Measures of time urgency, Type A assessment method, and gender were not found to be strongly related to A-B differences in cardiovascular reactivity.

,Socioeconomic Status And Blood Pressure Reactivity In Healthy Black Adolescents.,"Adolescents in low-socioeconomic-status environments are more susceptible to illnesses, such as hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. This study examined the influence of both neighborhood- and family-level socioeconomic status (SES) on blood pressure (BP) reactivity in a healthy sample of 76 black adolescents. It was hypothesized that a higher level of parental education and/or income would reduce the elevated BP reactivity associated with living in poorer neighborhoods. Census-derived data were obtained using each participant's address. Neighborhood level of SES was based on percentage of households below the poverty line, female-headed households, owner-occupied housing, percentage vacant housing, and average number of persons per household. Family level of SES was based on self-reported level of parental education and annual family income. Adolescents participated in a competitive video game to establish their BP reactivity scores. As predicted, adolescents who lived in poorer neighborhoods had lower diastolic BPs if their parents were more (versus less) educated (P<0.05; 7+/-8 versus 13+/-6 mm Hg). Adolescents who lived in poorer neighborhoods also had significantly lower diastolic BP reactivity (P<0.05) if their family had a higher (versus lower) annual income (7+/-7 versus 12+/-8 mm Hg). These data are the first to demonstrate the buffering effect of family SES on the negative health consequences of living in low-SES neighborhoods in healthy black adolescents.",pmid,10642348,pubmed,"Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)","Wilson, D K; Kliewer, W; Plybon, L; Sica, D A",2e3,NA,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,The Opponent Matters: Elevated Fmri Reward Responses To Winning Against A Human Versus A Computer Opponent During Interactive Video Game Playing.,"Winning against an opponent in a competitive video game can be expected to be more rewarding than losing, especially when the opponent is a fellow human player rather than a computer. We show that winning versus losing in a first-person video game activates the brain's reward circuit and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) differently depending on the type of the opponent. Participants played a competitive tank shooter game against alleged human and computer opponents while their brain activity was measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Brain responses to wins and losses were contrasted by fitting an event-related model to the hemodynamic data. Stronger activation to winning was observed in ventral and dorsal striatum as well as in vmPFC. Activation in ventral striatum was associated with participants' self-ratings of pleasure. During winning, ventral striatum showed stronger functional coupling with right insula, and weaker coupling with dorsal striatum, sensorimotor pre- and postcentral gyri, and visual association cortices. The vmPFC and dorsal striatum responses were stronger to winning when the subject was playing against a human rather than a computer. These results highlight the importance of social context in the neural encoding of reward value.",pmid,22952277,Scopus,"Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)","Kätsyri J., Hari R., Ravaja N., Nummenmaa L.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,"The Relationship Between Violent Video Games, Acculturation, And Aggression Among Latino Adolescents.","Multiple factors are involved in the occurrence of aggressive behavior. The purpose of this studywas to evaluate the hypotheses that Latino middle school children exposed to higher levels ofvideo game playing will exhibit a higher level of aggression and fighting compared to childrenexposed to lower levels and that the more acculturated middle school Latino children will playmore video games and will prefer more violent video games compared to less acculturatedmiddle school Latino children. This study involved 5,831 students attending eight public schoolsin Texas. A linear relationship was observed between the time spent playing video games andaggression scores. Higher aggression scores were significantly associated with heavier videoplaying for boys and girls (p<0.0001). The more students played video games, the more theyfought at school (p<0.0001). As Latino middle school students were more acculturated, theirpreference for violent video game playing increased, as well as the amount of time they playedvideo games.

,Violent Video Game Effects On Children And Adolescents. A Review Of The Literature.,"Studies of violent video games on children and adolescents were reviewed to: 1) determine the multiple effects; 2) to offer critical observations about common strengths and weaknesses in the literature; 3) to provide a broader perspective to understand the research on the effects of video games. The review includes general theoretical and methodological considerations of media violence, and description of the general aggression model (GAM). The literature was evaluated in relation to the GAM. Published literature, including meta-analyses, are reviewed, as well as relevant unpublished material, such as conference papers and dissertations. Overall, the evidence supports hypotheses that violent video game play is related to aggressive affect, physiological arousal, aggressive cognitions, and aggressive behaviours. The effects of video game play on school performance are also evaluated, and the review concludes with a dimensional approach to video game effects. The dimensional approach evaluates video game effects in terms of amount, content, form, and mechanics, and appears to have many advantages for understanding and predicting the multiple types of effects demonstrated in the literature.",pmid,16402007,pubmed,Minerva pediatrica,"Gentile, D A; Stone, W",2007,NA,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Xinyinqin: A Computer-Based Heart Sound Simulator.,"""Xinyinqin"" is the Chinese phoneticized name of the Heart Sound Simulator (HSS). The ""qin"" in ""Xinyinqin"" is the Chinese name of a category of musical instruments, which means that the operation of HSS is very convenient--like playing an electric piano with the keys. HSS is connected to the GAME I/O of an Apple microcomputer. The generation of sound is controlled by a program. Xinyinqin is used as a teaching aid of Diagnostics. It has been applied in teaching for three years. In this demonstration we will introduce the following functions of HSS: 1) The main program has two modules. The first one is the heart auscultation training module. HSS can output a heart sound selected by the student. Another program module is used to test the student's learning condition. The computer can randomly simulate a certain heart sound and ask the student to name it. The computer gives the student's answer an assessment: ""correct"" or ""incorrect."" When the answer is incorrect, the computer will output that heart sound again for the student to listen to; this process is repeated until she correctly identifies it. 2) The program is convenient to use and easy to control. By pressing the S key, it is able to output a slow heart rate until the student can clearly identify the rhythm. The heart rate, like the actual rate of a patient, can then be restored by hitting any key. By pressing the SPACE BAR, the heart sound output can be stopped to allow the teacher to explain something to the student. The teacher can resume playing the heart sound again by hitting any key; she can also change the content of the training by hitting RETURN key. In the future, we plan to simulate more heart sounds and incorporate relevant graphs.",pmid,8591549,Scopus,Medinfo. MEDINFO,"Zhan X.X., Pei J.H., Xiao Y.H.",1995,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas

,Analysis Of Load And Players’ Effort In 4Vs4 Small-Sided Handball Games In Relation To Court Dimensions,"The aim of the present study was to analyse load to which players were exposed and effort they invested in 4vs4 small-sided handball games in relation to various court dimensions. Eight male amateur handball players participated in three eight-minute 4vs4 (plus goalkeepers) small-sided handball games. The three court dimensions were 12×24 m, 30×15 m and 32×16 m. Using Global Positioning System devices (SPI pro elite 15Hz, GPSports), time-motion video analysis, and Borg’s scale for rating of perceived exertion (RPE), the following performance, physiological and psychological parameters were recorded: cyclic movements for distance covered, acyclic movements for the number of technical actions executed, heart rate, and RPE. The total distance travelled increased with the increase in court size (948.1±64.5, 1087.2±92.0 and 1079.8±90.6 on the 24×12 m, 30×15 m and 32×16 m court, respectively; p<.05). The distance covered by the players in four speed zones revealed a substantial difference between the games played on the 24×12 and 30×15m courts in the first and third (p<.05; moderate ES) speed zone. On the 24×12 m court the players covered more distance while moving in the first speed zone, but less distance when moving in the third speed zone (p<.05; moderate ES). On the 30×15 m court the players covered less distance while moving in the first speed zone, but they covered more distance by moving in the third speed zone (p<.05; moderate ES). There were no substantial differences found for the second and fourth speed zone cyclic movements and distances covered on all the three experimental court sizes. No statistical differences between the games played on various court dimensions were found in acyclic movements. No statistical differences were found in the analysis of heart rate either. Further analysis of players’ self-evaluated effort confirmed the trend of heart rate values, showing no statistical differences in the RPE values among the three different court dimensions. Our findings indicate that changing court dimensions during 4vs4 small-sided handball games could influence load imposed on players and their exertion. © 2016, University of Zagreb-Faculty of Kinesiology.

,Appraisal Of Emotions From Resources,"There have been tremendous advances in video-game graphics leading to realistic looking characters in many modern AAA titles. Unfortunately, the realistic looks do not always come with believable behavior of non-playable character AI.

,Cloud Gate: Challenging Reproducibility,"Jessica Litman argues that the basic reproductive unit of U.S. copyright law, the copy, ""no longer serves our needs, and we should jettison it completely"" (180). The challenge posed by modern technologies is central to her argument. Computers routinely produce ""copies"" of program code and data in use. Litman suggests that use-distinguished as commercial or noncommercial- would be a better way of organizing copyright legislation. But use is a complex and nuanced term, especially when applied to one ubiquitous reproductive technology, photography. Photography can be described as a group of technologies with multiple uses. Reproduction, in the sense of making copies, is only one aspect. For the average snapshooter, a photograph of a relative is not used to ""copy"" them, but rather to depict a likeness as a trigger for memories. Industrial uses of photography are different. Large-scale integrated circuits are fabricated using photographic technologies. Dark and light areas in a negative detect if a resistant mask should be deposited; the negative presents a mapped description of circuit pathways. Much like the copies found in computer program code, reproduction occurs without recognizable depiction. The photographic functions of reproduction, depiction, and detection are separate (Maynard, Engine and ""Talbot's Techonologies""). I agree with Litman's contention that the term copy has lost its utility, not merely because of digital technology, but because of technology in the broadest sense. Distinguishing between description and depiction differentiates between the ""copies"" computers use and copies as reproductions. The transitory ""copies"" of data present in digital technology are sets of instructions describing a tangible or ephemeral object-music, pictures, and words. Like the photographic negatives used to manufacture integrated circuits or circuit boards, the copied data tells machines how to reproduce objects. It neither depicts, nor reproduces them. These subtle distinctions are present in U.S. copyright law, but only in regard to architecture. Descriptions of buildings, in the form of plans, can be copyrighted.1 However, 17 U.S.C. §120(a) provides for a right of depiction: (a) Pictorial Representations Permitted.-The copyright in an architectural work that has been constructed does not include the right to prevent the making, distributing, or public display of pictures, paintings, photographs, or other pictorial representations of the work, if the building in which the work is embodied is located in or ordinarily visible from a public place. This right only extends to architecture; no other category in copyright law offers similar exclusions. The statute uses the term ""representation"" rather than depiction and only concerns pictorial representations. Nonetheless, U.S.C. 17 §120(a) differentiates between representation and reproduction and classifies photography among representative technologies. Photography's depictive power is often conflated with the descriptiveness of its reproductions. Its ability to describe physical objects into twodimensional projections is unparalleled. Photographs ""tell"" us things about the subject, but also provide raw material for imagination. A photograph is not a ""copy"" of its subject. I am sympathetic to Kendall L. Walton's controversial assertion that depictive photographs are essentially fictions facilitating imagination. ""To be a depiction is to have the function of serving as a prop in visual games of make believe"" (Walton, Mimesis 296). A depiction does more than ""copy"" reality. Nonetheless, because of the power of its descriptions, photography is more suspect than painting or sketching. A person sketching a public landmark is less likely to be interrogated than a person with a camera. The right to photograph in public does not exist by statute, except in the case of architecture. Following a 2005 controversy regarding Anish Kapoor's sculpture Cloud Gate, this chapter revisits the concept of reproducibility in art. Kapoor's sculpture captured the imagination of Internet users who warned of a new prohibition of photography taking hold. Though Walter Benjamin's ""The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction"" loses some of its prophetic luster in the aftermath of Cloud Gate, most of the mechanisms involved remain relevant. As a monument to capitalism and a ""copyrightable"" property, the sculpture provides a locus for discussing the right to photograph in public spaces and the use of media, both new and old. © 2008 by University of Michigan Press.

,Content Analysis Of The 18-Year Evolution Of Violence In Video Game Magazines,"Video games are popular social artifacts with the potential to shape players' behaviors, attitudes, and identities. For instance, researchers have produced evidence that violent video games are related to aggressive behavior and emotions. Although unstudied, video game magazines containing pictures and descriptions of games could similarly promote aggression. The current study analyzed game magazine articles published over an 18-year span (1988-2005). Results indicate that violence in articles has become more pervasive and realistic. The mood and themes of games have become less happy and more evil, scary, and dangerous. Violent elements (e.g., blood, weapons) have become more frequent, newer characters die in more violent ways, and their appearance, attire, and weapons indicate an increase in depictions of violence. Finally, more current articles contain more extreme violence against victims such as humans, women, police, and soldiers. Increasing violence could have implications for players' behavior. © 2009 School of Criminal Justice, University at Albany.",eid,2-s2.0-77952861675,Scopus,Journal of Criminal Justice and Popular Culture,Miller M.K.,2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Designing Affective Video Games To Support The Social-Emotional Development Of Teenagers With Autism Spectrum Disorders,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of developmental neuropsychiatric disorders, comprised of three diagnostic entities - autistic disorder (AD), Asperger's disorder (AS), and Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (including atypical autism) (PDD-NOS). A number of intervention techniques are currently used to reduce some of the associated challenges, with techniques ranging from behavioral therapy to dietary interventions and traditional counseling. This positional paper proposes the use of video games which leverage affective computing technologies as intervention in autism spectrum disorders in the context of the use of traditional play therapy with adolescents, who may feel uncomfortable engaging in traditional play with toys they may be too old for. It aims to explore the potential for greater 'social physics' made possible by affective computing technologies. This involves computationally 'recognizing' emotions in a user, often through the use of multimodal affective sensors, including facial expressions, postural shifts, and physiological signals such as heart rate, skin conductivity, and EEG signals. However, it is suggested that this should be augmented by researching the effect of social game design mechanisms on social-emotional development, particularly for those who experience difficulty with social interaction.",eid,2-s2.0-77952991543,Scopus,Annual Review of CyberTherapy and Telemedicine,Khandaker M.,2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Distributed Sound Rendering For Distributed Virtual Environments,"A distributed virtual environment allows remote users to communicate and interact with each other in a 3D environment through networks, in particular the Internet. Although existing work mainly focuses on visual communications, there is an increasing interest on audio communications too. The sound generation process is to modulate the input sound sources from the remote usersor from some autonomous objects by the reverberation of the environment to produce the output sound. There are a few sound rendering methods proposed, with different applications, such as architectural simulation and online games. To improve the rendering performance, some of these methods employ parallel hardware architectures or dedicated sound processing hardware. In this paper, we propose a distributed sound rendering architecture for realtime sound rendering in a distributed virtual environment with moving observers and sound sources. We also propose the distributed prioritized sound rendering method to improve the rendering performance while preserving the perceptual quality. The new architecture has the advantages that it is based on low cost PCs and is scalable.",eid,2-s2.0-77950320813,Scopus,Journal of Internet Technology,"Chan K.K.P., Lau R.W.H., Zhao J.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas

,"Effects Of Violent Versus Nonviolent Video Games On Children's Arousal, Aggressive Mood, And Positive Mood","This study investigated the relationship between violent video games and children's mood. A total of 71 children aged 8 to 12 years played a paper-and-pencil game, a nonviolent video game, and a violent video game. Results indicate that arousal, as measured by heart rate and self-reported arousal, increased significantly after playing the violent video game, as compared with the other two game conditions, with girls reporting more arousal than did boys. There was no significant increase in aggressive mood scores for either boys or girls after playing the violent game.

,Excessive Internet Use And Psychopathology: The Role Of Coping,"Objective: In 2013, the American Psychiatric Association included Internet Gaming Disorder in the diagnostic manual as a condition which requires further research, indicating the scientific and clinical community are aware of potential health concerns as a consequence of excessive Internet use. From a clinical point of view, it appears that excessive/addictive Internet use is often comorbid with further psychopathologies and assessing comorbidity is relevant in clinical practice, treatment outcome and prevention as the probability to become addicted to using the Internet accelerates with additional (sub)clinical symptoms. Moreover, research indicates individuals play computer games excessively to cope with everyday stressors and to regulate their emotions by applying media-focused coping strategies, suggesting pathological computer game players play in order to relieve stress and to avoid daily hassles. The aims of this research were to replicate and extend previous findings and explanations of the complexities of the relationships between excessive Internet use and Internet addiction, psychopathology and dysfunctional coping strategies. Method: Participants included 681 Polish university students sampled using an online battery of validated psychometric instruments. Results: Results of structural equation models revealed dysfunctional coping strategies (i.e., distraction, denial, self-blame, substance use, venting, media use, and behavioural disengagement) significantly predict excessive Internet use, and the data fit the theoretical model well. A second SEM showed media-focused coping and substance use coping significantly mediate the relationship between psychopathology (operationalised via the Global Severity Index) and excessive Internet use. Conclusions: The findings lend support to the self-medication hypothesis of addictive disorders, and suggest psychopathology and dysfunctional coping have additive effects on excessive Internet use. © 2017 Giovanni Fioriti Editore s.r.l.",eid,2-s2.0-85014318858,Scopus,Clinical Neuropsychiatry,"Kuss D.J., Dunn T.J., Wölfling K., Müller K.W., Hȩdzelek M., Marcinkowski J.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Facial Expression Mirroring-Based Classification Of Emotions Using Electroencephalogram Signals,"People have lived in a way delivering many messages through various non-verbal communicative means such as facial expressions and voice tones. Recently, many researchers have attempted to do tasks dealing with emotions conveyed through some immanent bio- signals for human-computer interaction or human-robot interaction. If we switch some applications of bio-signals dominantly occupied to cure the handicapped or the rehabilitant to entertainment areas including video games, artificial life and interactive theaters, this will provide us with a solution to overcome drawbacks caused by traditional interfaces in which it may allow us to more naturally experience human-oriented contents. In this paper, we present a mechanism to do analysis of electroencephalogram signals originated from emotional impulses and to carry out classification of the emotion. Also we have validated the methods to foresee usability for brain-computer interface. The partial derivatives of EEG are taken as features for some training data set gained from facial expression mirroring. Four emotions including neutral, anger, happiness, and surprise have been classified using the support vector machines. The experimental results can be extended in providing innovative potential in the areas including games, virtual reality, agents, and various entertainments.",eid,2-s2.0-84878197572,Scopus,International Journal of Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering,"Lee C.-Y., Chin S.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Fit For Play: A Proof Of Concept In Computer Games For Health,"One of the biggest problems in today's society is promotion of health. How do we as responsible parents, governments etc promote good health when there appears to be an ever growing tendency away from active sports towards more sedentary entertainments such as TV, Internet and computer games? Indeed some researchers argue that the popularity of computer games can be cited as a contributing factor to the higher percentage in obesity amongst adolescents. There is some evidence that the intrinsic appeal of computer games lures individuals into sedentary game playing as an alternative to other activities of a more physical nature e.g. sport. An alternate view is that the infrastructure of computer games technology presents the individual game player with a wider range of opportunities than those afforded by traditional sports (e.g. control, participation, social constructs etc). An initial study highlights the possible contribution of computer games as physical activity specialists. In order to substantiate this possible avenue of research a series of ad hoc experiments have been carried out utilising fitness metrics such as heart rate and blood pressure in a variety of scenarios. Although the sample tested was small and in no way indicates a rigorous medical field trial, the results indicate that this approach could yield a new paradigm in the battle to combat such conditions as obesity and coronary heart disease.",eid,2-s2.0-24644511811,Scopus,WSEAS Transactions on Computers,"Chandler C., Noriega L.",2005,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Gender Of Opponent And Type A Competitiveness Predict Cardiovascular Responses During Competition,"We investigated associations between components of Type A behavior, assessed with the student version of the Jenkins Activity Survey, and cardiovascular reactivity in young men and women. Men competed on a video game task against the machine or against men or women; women competed against the machine or against men. Reactivity differed Utile between the genders and was generally higher during competition against a man than during competition against the machine, regardless of Type A component scores. Reactivity was greater in men who scored higher on the hard-driving/competitive component when the opponent was a woman. These findings are explained in tenus of arousal associated with competitive engagement and attitudes about competition against men and women. Neither the speed/impatience scale, nor the total Type A measure was consistently related to cardiovascular reactivity. © 1996 Select Press.",eid,2-s2.0-24044546213,Scopus,Journal of Social Behavior and Personality,"Felsten G., Leitten C.L.",1996,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas

,"High Versus Low Aggressive Priming During Video-Game Training: Effects On Violent Action During Game Play, Hostility, Heart Rate, And Blood Pressure","Playing violent video games is related to increased negative affect and cardiovascular reactivity. We examined the influence of high and low aggressive priming during video-game training on violence during game play (e.g., shooting, choking), hostility, frustration with game play, blood pressure, and heart rate. Male undergraduates (N= 36) were assigned to a high aggressive or low aggressive video-game priming condition. After training, they played Metal Gear Solid™, which allows players to advance by using stealth, violence, or both. Participants in the high aggressive priming condition used significantly more violent action during game play and reported more hostility than those in the low aggressive priming condition. Heart rate was correlated with feelings of hostility. These findings indicate that both aggressive priming and use of game violence influence arousal and negative affect and might increase behavioral aggression.",eid,2-s2.0-0036914485,Scopus,Journal of Applied Social Psychology,"Panee C.D., Ballard M.E.",2002,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Metabolic Demands Of Match Performance In Young Soccer Players,"The aim of the present study was to determine metabolic responses, movement patterns and distance covered at running speeds corresponding to fixed blood lactate concentrations (FBL s) in young soccer players during a match play. A further aim of the study was to evaluate the relationships between FBL s, maximal oxygen consumption (VO 2max) and distance covered during a game. A multistage field test was administered to 32 players to determine FBL s and VO 2max. Blood lactate (LA), heart rate (HR) and rate of perceived exertion (RPE) responses were obtained from 36 players during tournament matches filmed using six fixed cameras. Images were transferred to a computer, for calibration and synchronization. In all players, values for LA and HR were higher and RPE lower during the 1 st half compared to the 2 nd half of the matches (p &lt; 0.01). Players in forward positions had higher LA levels than defenders, but HR and RPE values were similar between playing positions. Total distance and distance covered in jogging, low-moderatehigh intensity running and low intensity sprint were higher during the 1 st half (p &lt; 0.01). In the 1 st half, players also ran longer distances at FBL s [p&lt;0.01; average running speed at 2mmol·L -1 (FBL 2): 3.32 ± 0.31m·s -1 and average running speed at 4mmol·L -1 (FBL 4): 3.91 ± 0.25m·s -1]. There was a significant difference between playing positions in distance covered at different running speeds (p &lt; 0.05). However, when distance covered was expressed as FBL s, the players ran similar distances. In addition, relationships between FBL s and total distance covered were significant (r = 0.482 to 0.570; p &lt; 0.01). In conclusion, these findings demonstrated that young soccer players experienced higher internal load during the 1 st half of a game compared to the 2 nd half. Furthermore, although movement patterns of players differed between playing positions, all players experienced a similar physiological stress throughout the game. Finally, total distance covered was associated to fixed blood lactate concentrations during play. © Journal of Sports Science and Medicine.",eid,2-s2.0-84857887828,Scopus,Journal of Sports Science and Medicine,"Aslan A., Açikada C., Güvenç A., Gören H., Hazir T., Özkara A.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas

,Psychophysiologic Factors And Performance In Ice Hockey Goalies During Competition,"Studying goalies, who play a key position in hockey requires examining psychophysiologic variables and their relationship to performance during games when the outcome is important [15]. This investigation tested all three aspects of emotion (subjective, physiologic changes, and performance). Nine male goalies completed questionnaires and provided salivary cortisol before, during, and after each game. Heart rate (ECG signal) was integrated with the goalie's performance video. Goalies rated on Likert Scales; headaches, stomach aches, insomnia, nervousness, and awareness of heart pounding. Data from 16 games were obtained. Of nine, two goalies provided data on three games each; one goalie was classified as a responder and the other a non-responder, based on salivary cortisol levels (SCL). The responder's SCL increased 572% between baseline and post-period assessments, whereas SCL in the non-responder increased 50% above baseline. The responder's SCL increased 8 times baseline when he faced 16 shots in a period. The responder goalie's game heart rates (HRs) were 160, 152, and 167 beats per minute (bpm) and the non-responder's HRs were 147, 132, and 142 bpm for three games.

Evaluation of new facial composite systems in the laboratory allows a measure of experimental control, but lacks the emotional impact of a real crime. As a step towards a more realistic level of stress for our participant witnesses, we presented target face images while they were engaged in playing an action thriller computer game. The quality of the composites they subsequently produced was compared with that of a second 'onlooker' participant, who merely observed the game and had the same view of the target face. Heart rate monitoring confirmed that the players were more stressed than the onlookers while the recognition rate of the onlooker composites was twice as good.

,The Effects Of Music Choice On Task Performance: A Study Of The Impact Of Self-Selected And Experimenter-Selected Music On Driving Game Performance And Experience,"Music listening in everyday life tends to accompany the completion of other everyday activities in a highly personalised manner. However, music and task performance studies have tended to be experimenter-centred and contextually isolated, largely independent of the listener's music practices and preference. The present study adopted a listener-centred approach to compare the effects of self-selected and experimenter-selected music (high and low arousal), on concurrent activity performance and experience. 125 participants completed three laps of a driving game in either (i) silence (ii) car sounds alone; car sounds with the addition of (iii) self-selected music, (iv) High-Arousal music or (v) Low-Arousal music. Three performance measures (accuracy-collisions, time-ms, and speed-mph) and 5 experience measures (distraction, liking, appropriateness, enjoyment, and tension-anxiety) were taken. Participants exposed to their self-selected music were most efficient, perceived lowest distraction, highest enjoyment, liking and appropriateness, and experienced a reduction in tension-anxiety. In contrast, performance and experience were poorest when exposed to High-Arousal experimenter-selected music. Participants were most inaccurate, perceived highest distraction, lowest liking, enjoyment and appropriateness, and experienced an increase in tension-anxiety. Collectively, the findings highlight the efficacy of self-selected music as a tool to optimise response in the everyday activity context for which it is selected. Accordingly, the results are discussed in relation to potential implications for the performance and experience of concurrent tasks such as video games. Additionally, the discussion highlights theories of attention-distraction, arousal and affect modification, and subjective experiences of music listening. © 2009 by ESCOM European Society for the Cognitive Sciences of Music.",eid,2-s2.0-77954548013,Scopus,Musicae Scientiae,"Cassidy G., MacDonald R.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,The Integrated Model Of (Dys-) Functionality: Reconstructing Patterns Of Gaming As Self-Medication In Biographical Interviews With Video Game Addicts,"We aim to build a new theory of highly committed problematic video gaming based on rich qualitative data and to compare it to existing theories. To do this, we used hermeneutic analytical methods and grounded theory methodology to analyze 125 hours of recording from 42 biographical interviews, 23 of them with long-term follow-up. Participants were addicted (ex-) gamers according to screening instruments, aged 16 to 44, 29 males and 13 females.The integrated (dys-) functionality model shows in-game behavior of participants to be dysfunctional in that it hinders advancement in several distinguishable real-life biographical quests (for success, for belonging, and for autonomy) and at the same time functional in that it matches these quests. The model integrates two seemingly irreconcilable research traditions: The addiction/disease model in medical-psychological research investigates dysfunctionality of gaming in pathological gamers. Game studies focus on functionality of in-game behavior and establish gamer typologies based on gaming motives. By adding the biographical context to game studies, but keeping the gamer's perspective, we show that gamers whose lives become dominated by gaming may know what they want and “virtually” get it, but still not “really” get it in the long term. “Compensatory” gaming does not, thus, equal unproblematic or “non-addicted” gaming. © 2015, Inst. fur Klinische Psychologie und Gemeindepsychologie.

,The Routinization Of Creativity: Lessons From The Case Of A Video-Game Creative Powerhouse,"The aim of this contribution is to proceed to an in-depth exploration of the micro-context of the origin of routines and of their intimate link with organizational creativity. Our view is that organizational creativity orchestrates continuous interactions between different types of routines, operating at different levels of the organization. More precisely we propose distinguishing three types of routines: - First, the routines issued from formal structures or hierarchical working groups in the firm (functional groups, project teams, task force, etc.), for which the context of work and coordination of specialized tasks is defined ex ante by the hierarchy of the firm; - Second, the routines emerging from informal structures, the ""knowing communities"" which is a ""generic term that defines different types of autonomous learning groups of individuals (communities of practice, epistemic communities, and other more or less informal learning groups) united by common beliefs and interests who voluntarily share their resources on a long term basis in order to create and diffuse knowledge""; - Third, the routines that are inherently related to the organizational creativity of the firm, which are essentially corporate routines as expression of patterns of thinking, feeling and acting in the corporate culture. In essence they are the genes of collective identity, and take the shape of project management staging and gating principles and practices, framing collective divergent exploration and convergent production toward a creative goal. The contribution is based on an in-depth analysis of the organizational creativity in the world-leading videogame company, Ubisoft, with a special focus on the studio located in Montréal. To some extent, Ubisoft is one of the flagships of the ""creative industries"", in which the clear imperative is to sustain creativity on a permanent basis. These reasons explain the choice we made to test our approach of organizational creativity and routines in this firm. © 2014, Walter de Gruyter GmbH.

,Transformative Interactions: Designing Positive Technologies To Foster Self-Transcendence And Meaning,"In the last years, there has been a growing interest in the role of selftranscendent positive emotions - such as awe, elevation and admiration - in fostering wellbeing and personal development. In particular, recent studies suggest that the experience of these emotions can promote self-improvement, prosocial behaviour and feelings of spirituality. The goal of this contribution is to introduce Computer-Mediated Self-transcendence (CMST) as a possible new research pathway in Positive Technology, which refers to the use of interactive technologies for promoting, facilitating or enhancing emotional peak experiences. Specifically, we suggest that the goal of CMST can be achieved by combining virtual reality, videogames and the languages of art, to design mediated transformative experiences that include emotional and epistemic affordances.

,"Watching Handball Transmissions: Experiences Of Autonomy, Competency And Relatedness","The current article presents a qualitative study of Danish television viewer's reception of Danish handball transmissions. The overall aim of the study has been to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of televised sport as a specific kind of television entertainment. The analysis shows that, due to the dramaturgic structure of handball transmissions, viewers consider such transmissions particularly reliable and effective sources of entertainment. The transmissions' entertainment value derives from their specific ability to give the viewers a complex experience of feeling autonomous and competent when mastering the game and in relation to others. The study shows that entertainment concerns both affective involvement and identity formation, as social and cultural meaning seem to be at the root of involvement. Even though both men and women find great joy in the transmissions, their viewing is embedded in quite diverse patterns regarding additional media use. This points to gendered differences regarding how the entertaining experience is basically received and the qualities sought and pursued in the transmissions.",eid,2-s2.0-77957137393,Scopus,Nordicom Review,Frandsen K.,2010,Article,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,A Framework For Element-Based Computer Graphics.,"There is an imbalance between personal and algorithmic control in existing techniques for element-based computer graphics. A refraining of the traditional graphics pipeline is used to address this. By turning modelling and rendering into an interactive process, and introducing semi-autonomous agents to manage elements, we develop a framework through which it is possible to build applications with a given control balance. Agents negotiate control of their representations on a canvas via interactions in agent space. Interaction with the rendered image on canvas is conveyed to agents responsible for that image, which interpret the interaction and adjust the underlying model appropriately. In addition, the concept of a coalition, as in game theory, provides a means for groups of agents to organise or be organised. This framework is realised as a prototype engine along with a series of examples that illustrate a broad range of variations in control balance that are possible within this framework.",pq_id,33201757,proquest_dt,NA,"Mason, Katherine Merle",2006,THES,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Active Target Localization And Tracking With Application To Robotic Environmental Monitoring,"Thanks to advances in miniaturization, computing power, reliable sensors, and battery life, mobile robots are increasingly being used for a wide variety of environmental monitoring tasks. No longer confined to factory floors or controlled environments, robots for remote sensing in dangerous or hard-to-reach  environments could provide the same scalability, precision, and reliability to environmental monitoring as they did to industrial applications.  To enable this kind of long-term, reliable, autonomous mobile sensor deployment, algorithms which can ensure that the robots achieve their sensing tasks are required.    In the first part of the thesis, we study the problem of using one or more mobile robots equipped with bearing sensors to locate a stationary target in minimum time. The problem requires optimizing the measurement locations of the robots  to gather the required information about the target's location.  In addition, when multiple  robots collaborate, we include communication constraints in the path planning objective. Two formulations for this problem are studied. First, we study the offline problem of finding measurement trajectories when the true target location is known. Second, we study the online version and show how to adapt the offline solution to the situation when the target location is not known, while preserving the quality guarantees of the offline solution.    In the second part of the thesis,  we study the problem of locating multiple stationary targets using a single mobile robot. We formulate a novel coverage problem and provide two main results. We first study the problem of initializing consistent estimate  of the targets' locations.  These initial estimates are used to seed an active localization algorithm which is shown to localize the targets quickly.  In a second formulation, we assume that the targets are within a set of polygonal regions, but have no further information about the distribution or number of targets in the environment.  An algorithm is provided which can choose measurement locations to localize all the targets to within desired precision in near optimal time.    In the third part of the thesis, we study the problem of using bearing information to track and capture a moving target. We present two formulations based on  pursuit-evasion games. In the open plane, the objective is for a mobile robot to minimize the distance to a maneuvering target when only uncertain bearing information is available to the robot. Then, we study the problem of capturing the maneuvering target in a closed environment by moving close to it. We show that the size of the environment relative to the sensing noise determines if this is possible.    In addition to theoretical results, we present field studies of using one or  more mobile robots to detect radio transmitters using these results. We show that the algorithms presented are suitable for use in monitoring invasive fish.",pq_id,1733949402,proquest_dt,NA,"Vander Hook, Joshua David",2015,THES,Ph.D.,reviewer1,Andreas
,Distributed Trust Management In Autonomic Networks,"The management of autonomic networks has gained more and more attentions because of their wide applications and control difficulties. Autonomic networks are decentralized and self-organized. Without global knowledge on the states of autonomic networks, it is difficult to predict behaviors of such networks and thus to conduct proper network management and control. This dissertation is the starting point of my effort to theoretically understand the complex characteristics of autonomic networks. In particular, I focus on a specific application: distributed trust management.    We view trust among users as a set of relations established on the basis of trust credentials and required by specified policies. Two important components of a distributed trust management system are studied in this work: trust credential distribution and trust evaluation. In autonomic networks, trust credentials are distributed throughout the network. Given the mobility and dynamics of the networks, it is important to properly distribute trust credentials such that users are able to efficiently obtain required credentials and update existing credentials. I present a trust credential distribution scheme based on network coding. After obtaining credentials in need, policies are required for users to evaluate trustworthiness of targets in a distributed way. In this dissertation, I model distributed trust evaluation as an estimation problem and trust evaluation policies based on local interactions are studied. I investigate the convergence of both deterministic and stochastic voting rules and prove their effectiveness with the present of misbehaving users.    Autonomic networks rely on collaboration among users. The conflict between the benefit from collaboration and the required cost for collaboration naturally leads to game-theoretic studies. I study collaboration based on cooperative games with communication constraints and give the conditions under which users are willing to collaborate. The results in this dissertation show that a well-designed trust management system is helpful to enforce collaboration. Besides collaboration, I show that trust can be used to the utility optimization problems as well. The effect of trust values is that in the routing and scheduling problems the trustworthiness of the node will be automatically considered and used. For example, packets will not be routed frequently to suspicious nodes.",pq_id,304854171,proquest_dt,NA,"Jiang, Tao",2007,THES,Ph.D.,reviewer1,Andreas
,Impact Of Genetic Predisposition And Environmental Stress On Measures Of Preclinical Essential Hypertension,"The main objective of this project was to determine the impact of genetic risk and chronic environmental stress on measures of preclinical essential hypertension (EH) (e.g., exaggerated cardiovascular reactivity, increased resting hemodynamics and increased left ventricular mass [LVM]). A secondary objective was to evaluate the moderating and interactive effects of ethnicity, gender, body mass index [BMI] and anger expression on EH risk indices. Two genes with relevance for blood pressure (BP) control (e.g., beta-2 adrenergic receptor [ADRB2] gene and serotonin transporter [5-HTT] gene) were used to define genetic risk. Chronic environmental stress was assessed by socioeconomic status (SES) and subjective social status (SSS). The project consisted of three sequential studies on a large, multiethnic cohort of young adults (N>500). The first two studies were cross-sectional and based on the analysis of cardiovascular reactivity, resting hemodynamics and LVM data collected at a single visit. The third study was longitudinal and involved the tracking of BP and LVM over a 15-year span from childhood to early adulthood.    In the first study, ADRB2 haplotype significantly interacted with anger suppression in African Americans such that high anger suppressing carriers had the highest resting SBP (p<.05) and TPR reactivity to a cold pressor task (p<.01). In European Americans, ADRB2 haplotype significantly interacted with BMI to predict resting hemodynamics, such that carriers who were high in BMI showed the highest SBP (p<.05). In the second study, a significant interaction between the 5-HTT promoter region polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) and social status was found for cardiovascular reactivity, such that S allele homozygotes who were low in SES and high in SSS exhibited the greatest BP and TPR reactivity to the video game stressor (p-values<.05). No significant interaction was found between 5-HTTLPR and social status in the longitudinal study, however a significant 5-HTTLPR by BMI interaction was determined for LVM, such that obese LL homozygotes had the greatest LVM over time (p<.001). Results from this project expand what is currently known with regard to EH etiology and carry implications for the prevention of EH through the early consideration of genetic, environmental and demographic risk factors.",pq_id,304956392,proquest_dt,NA,"Poole, Joseph Christian",2006,THES,Ph.D.,reviewer1,Andreas
,Incentive-Centered Design For Scheduling In Parallel And Distributed Systems,"Distributed systems comprise components that are owned and operated by autonomous organizations. These organizations are rational (self-interested and welfare-maximizing) and they have no a prior motivation for cooperation. Rationality leads them to manipulate the systems if it benefits them to do so. Organizations respond to incentives. To prevent manipulations, incentives must be explicitly aligned with the system's objectives. Incentive-centered design (ICD), which integrates the motivational human behavior aspect of social sciences with the computational tractability aspect of computer science, specifically addresses these concerns and provides methods to mitigate them.   We examine the incentives present in several distributed system resource allocation problems. We model these problems as games and then used ICD to devise protocols that obtained their desired objectives in a self-interested, competitive setting. The first problems we examine are designing incentive-compatible mechanisms for scheduling divisible loads in distributed systems. Divisible loads is a form of data parallelism in which large data sets are partitioned into fractions. All fractions require an identical type of processing. Scheduling requires knowledge of the processors. Since the processors are rational, they may choose to misreport their capacities, which adversely affects the quality of scheduling. We design several mechanisms that obtain optimal schedules in this setting. Each mechanism is specific to a network architecture as the architecture affects partitioning and the optimality conditions. We examine three architectures: bus, linear, and tree networks. For the bus network, we design three classical centralized mechanisms. The centralized mechanisms are not feasible for the tree and linear networks as the processors cannot communicate directly with the mechanism center, a limitation of these architectures. Instead, we design distributed mechanisms in which the information and algorithms are distributed throughout the network. These mechanisms introduce new avenues for manipulation and we address this by creating incentives for processors to monitor one another. We then examine divisible load scheduling using coalitional games. An application owner receives a payoff when her job is finished. The amount she receives though decreases with time and furthermore, the payoff must be shared with the processors computing her job. She forms a coalition with a set of processors to maximize her profit, which is the difference between payoff and costs. We model this problem as a coalitional game and we show that stable coalitions between application users and processors occur.   We next examine parallel job scheduling in parallel systems comprising identical processors. A parallel job differs from a sequential job or task in that it can execute on two or more processors. We consider two different types of parallel job scheduling. The first type we examine is the batch scheduling of rigid jobs. Batch scheduling requires that all jobs are present at the start of scheduling. A parallel job is rigid if it requires a fixed number of processors. If fewer processors are assigned, the job fails. If more processors are assigned, the job does not speedup. Associated with each job is a deadline and payoff. The job's owner receives the payoff if her job completes by its deadline; otherwise, her payoff is zero. The scheduling objective then is to maximize the sum of payoffs. The users are rational: they will misreport their jobs' parameters if it benefits them to do so. We design an incentive-compatible scheduling mechanism aimed specifically for this problem. Because the mechanism is incentive compatible, rational users choose to truthfully declare their parameters to the scheduler. The second type of parallel job scheduling we consider is the online scheduling of malleable jobs. Online scheduling differs from the batch scheduling in that the scheduler cannot foresee jobs arriving in advance. The scheduling objective must be optimized with the lack of information. Unlike rigid jobs, a malleable jobs can be adapted to execute on any number of processors. Each job is associated with an arrival time (release time), deadline, and payoff. Similar to the rigid job problem, if the job completes by its deadline the self-interested user receives the payoff, otherwise, she receives zero. Besides the online aspect, this problem differs from the rigid one in that the scheduler must choose the number of processors to assign to the job. For this problem we design an online, incentive-compatible mechanism. If a job is scheduled to execute, the mechanism assigns it the number of processors that minimizes its execution time.",pq_id,305016982,proquest_dt,NA,"Carroll, Thomas E.",2009,THES,Ph.D.,reviewer1,Andreas
,Modeling Natural Phenomena With Lattice Boltzmann Method,"We have adopted a numerical method in computational fluid dynamics, the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM), for simulation and visualization of natural phenomena. The LBM is an alternative and promising numerical scheme for modeling the fluid dynamics from a microscopic perspective, and recovering the Navier-Stokers equations. The LBM has the following obvious advantages: (1) it uses local and simple operators to model complex and nonlinear fluid behaviors; (2) it discretizes the micro-physics of local interactions between fluids and objects, and thus can handle very complex boundary conditions, such as deep urban canyons, curved walls, arbitrarily-shaped objects and dynamic boundaries of moving objects; (3) due to its discrete nature, the LBM lends itself to multi-resolution approaches, and its computational pattern, is easily parallelizable. In addition to the traditional Single-relaxation-time LBM, we introduce a more general version: the Multiple-relaxation-time LBM, which is more appropriate for coupling physical properties (temperature, body forces, etc.) to fluid dynamics and it provides more stable computation. We have applied this method to model light objects floating in the wind, heat shimmering of air, mirage, solid melting and flowing, and contaminant plume dispersion in urban environment. We have accelerated the LBM on commodity graphics processing units (GPUs), achieving interactive performance for our applications. Moreover, we have modelled the front spreading phenomena of fire and flows on 3D surfaces. Our method provides fast and simple simulations and allows users to conveniently control the propagation behaviors. Our LBM-based approaches provide a physically based framework for modeling and simulating natural phenomena that enables the development of computer graphics, movies, games, and scientific prediction simulations.",pq_id,304927658,proquest_dt,NA,"Zhao, Ye",2006,THES,Ph.D.,reviewer1,Andreas

,Path Planning In Similar Environments,"Path planning aims at navigating a robot from an initial configuration to a goal configuration without violating various constraints. The problem of path planning is theoretically intractable (PSPACE hard), but in everyday life we (as human beings) navigate in our environment without much difficulty. This is partially due to the experiences we learned since childhood. The learning process may be complex, but one of the reasons that we can learn such tasks is that most objects we encounter today are similar or identical to the objects we encountered yesterday or even years ago. Environments with similar objects are quite common. For example, desks and chairs in a classroom or in an office may be moved around from one place to another frequently, but unfamiliar items are seldom introduced. Even different environments, such as two apartments, or a manufacturing factory and an airport garage, may share many similar items. The main differences are usually in the arrangements. Similar environments can also be found in simulated reality, e.g., in different levels of a video game or in the different regions of a virtual reality world, where many objects are intentionally duplicated to reduce the (e.g., modeling and rendering) complexity. A dynamic environment where obstacles allowed to move can be considered as a continuous sequence of similar static environments due to motion coherence. We term ""discrete similar-workspace problem"" for static environments and ""continuous similar-workspace problem"" for dynamic environments. In this thesis, I investigated path planners that can address both problems and recognize this similarity in order to significantly improve efficiency and completeness.    More specifically, I developed a path planner which exploits similarity across different static environments. This planner remembers the computation (the ""mental image"") for every obstacle encountered. Given a new problem, by carefully reusing these existing computations, the planner quickly builds a roadmap from its knowledge base. In order to improve reusability, I also designed a new shape matching method for polygons. The experimental results show that the planner is 3–8 orders of magnitude faster than most existing methods in environments with various similarity. Moreover, the success rate is kept at 100%. In other words, once a query is solved, it guarantees to be able to find a collision free path in the subsequent runs.    Environments with dynamic obstacles can also be viewed as a sequence of similar environments. In fact, existing methods have explored the temporal coherence (i.e. similarity) and gain efficiency by preserving the bulk of the roadmap and only repairing the invalid part due to motions of obstacles. However, all these methods repair blindly and periodically at fixed time intervals with little attempt to analyze the similarity or changes of the planning spaces across different time instances. This results in either redundant updates or failure to detect invalid edges and nodes. Based on the assumption that obstacles move along some known trajectories, we proposed a motion planner that detects critical moments when the topology of the free configuration space changes. The critical moments can be classified into two categories: 1) a time of contact is when the space between two configuration obstacles closes, and 2) a  time of separation is when the space opens up. As shown in the experimental results, our planner not only avoids redundant computation (about one order of magnitude faster) but also improves the chances of finding a valid path.    In many real life applications such as rescue robots and autonomous vehicles, the robot may have no prior knowledge of obstacles' motions. I developed a new geometric tool which allows the robot to determine the critical moments when the robot and obstacles can collide. Then, only at such critical moments, the robot updates its belief of the environment and re-plans if necessary. The main challenge in predicting collision stems from the assumption that obstacles' motions are unknown. To provide conservative estimation, this new tool models all obstacles as adversarial agents so that obstacles will move in the way to minimize the time that the robot remains collision-free.",pq_id,1492749212,proquest_dt,NA,"Lu, Yanyan",2013,THES,Ph.D.,reviewer1,Andreas
,Physiological Responding In A Two-Dimensional Social Interaction Simulation.,"Although there were no observed effects, several suggestions were made to inform researchers in designing a study of fluid interaction. With the increasing usage of computers in the conduct of research, there is ample evidence to suggest that some emotional or physiological responses may be reliably measured using two-dimensional computer simulations. It was predicted in accordance with the previous aggression literature that when the participant was in the role of aggressor that autonomic nervous system (ANS) responses would decrease as a function of concentration or cognitive load. It was also predicted that when the participant was in the role of virtual victim, a significant increase in ANS function would be observed as a manifestation of the so termed 'flight'response were recruited. A two-dimensional virtual challenge arena was programmed using a video game interface. Fourty-two college students with no prior history of pathology alternatively attacked and defended against an attacker during which, SCL and HR were measured. General recreational data and computer usage as well as valence information was also collected. Results showed that the interaction was rated as 'somewhat pleasant'regardless of which role the participant played. They also rated the conflict as 'somewhat excited' and felt 'mostly in control' of the interaction. Overall the interaction was rated as being, 'slightly unrealistic'. Physiological measurements were made during five discrete phases. Although statistically significant differences were observed between the measurement phases verifying that the phases are likely to be meaningful, there were no reliably significant differences between the different conflict conditions in measuring heart rate and skin conductance. It was proposed that several possibilities, including too complex a measurement design, non-discrete measurement phases and individual variances in acclimation and perceived novelty of the task may have resulted in the failure to find meaningful group differences among conditions.",pq_id,33388310,proquest_dt,NA,"Brannon, Sean",2007,THES,NA,reviewer1,Andreas
,Procedural Animation Of Emotionally Expressive Gaze Shifts In Virtual Embodied Characters,"Believably animated virtual human characters appear in many diverse fields of computer science research and areas of the technology industry, including video games, animated films, and virtual training environments. In these applications, animated virtual humans play roles ranging from friendly companions, to helpful tutors, to vicious villains. A key aspect that distinguishes these applications is user interaction. In video games and virtual training environments, interaction between virtual human characters and human users is required, in contrast to animated films. However, the animation methods that produce often very believable behavior for these animated films do not apply well to interactive domains. This leads to an expressivity gap between those animated virtual humans which are interactive and those which are not.    One ability that non-interactive animated characters possess and interactive characters do not is the ability to reveal important information about their emotional state through the use of glances or glares while the character remains silent. The goal of this research is to provide this ability to interactive characters. It does so through a gaze model capable of displaying a desired selection of physical behaviors while directing gaze towards an arbitrary target. This model of gaze, called the Expressive Gaze Model (EGM), combines body movement based on motion capture data with eye movement based on visual neuroscience data.    In addition, this research provides an empirically determined preliminary mapping between gaze behavior and emotional attribution. The results demonstrate that by obtaining a set of low-level gaze behaviors annotated with emotional data, and then generating gaze shifts through the composition of these low-level behaviors, the attribution of emotion to the resulting gaze shift can be predicted. This indicates that gaze shifts that display emotion states can be generated from these low-level gaze behaviors without using motion capture of the displayed emotion.",pq_id,304463399,proquest_dt,NA,"Lance, Brent Jason",2008,THES,Ph.D.,reviewer1,Andreas
,Real-Time Smooth Surface Construction On The Graphics Processing Unit,"Increased realism in interactive graphics and gaming requires complex smooth surfaces to be rendered at ever higher frame rates. In particular, representations used to model surfaces offline, such as spline and subdivision surfaces, have to be modified or reorganized to allow for efficient usage of the graphics processing unit and its SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) parallelism. This dissertation presents a novel algorithm for converting quad meshes on the GPU to smooth, water-tight surfaces at the highest speed documented so far. The conversion reproduces bi-cubic splines wherever possible and closely mimics the shape of the Catmull-Clark subdivision surface by c-patches where a vertex has a valence different from 4. The smooth surface is piecewise polynomial and has well-defined normals everywhere.",pq_id,304655498,proquest_dt,NA,"Ni, Tianyun",2008,THES,Ph.D.,reviewer1,Andreas
,Routing In Random Ad-Hoc Networks: Provably Better Than Worst-Case,"Wireless networks, such as sensor networks or general ad-hoc networks, present special challenges for routing problems due to high energy constraints, failures, and node autonomy. As such, traditional methods of constructing and fixing a centralized routing topology and then simply expecting nodes to forward accordingly in the absence of any further incentives to do so suffer reliability drawbacks. We look to light-weight and game-theoretic proposals based on random walks and game-theoretic techniques to deal with these reliability concerns. In particular, we consider random walks for information collection, path auctions for one-to-one routing, and a locally minimum cost forwarding game (LMCF) for all-to-one reverse multicast routing. For each of the three routing scenarios considered, a trade-off between reliability and efficiency is observed in the worst-cases: There exist wireless network configurations for which random walks take a maximally long expected time to visit all nodes, path auctions require maximal overpayments to ensure truthfulness, and any Nash equilibria for locally minimum cost forwarding are arbitrarily costlier than the global optimum. We further demonstrate NP-hardness results and approximation hardness results regarding computation of optimal truthful mechanisms and optimal Nash equilibria for the game-theoretic scenarios present. On the other hand, a clique is also a possible wireless network configuration formed by setting a large enough (broadcast radius, and the clique configuration demonstrates optimal efficiency for all three. The extreme downside to such a configuration, however, is that such a large broadcast radius would rapidly deplete the system's energy, yielding it completely infeasible. What becomes apparent then, is that the appropriate question to ask is the following: What is the efficiency of each of the three proposed methods for a typical wireless network of low broadcast radius'? Does a nicer structure tend to arise despite negative worst-case behavior for the reliable routing problems considered in this work on the relevant random models of wireless networks'? A central theme of this work is a resounding, theoretically sound ""Yes"" to that question for all three scenarios: We prove that each of the three proposed methods are almost always efficient under relevant, models and metrics models for wireless networks.",pq_id,304653320,proquest_dt,NA,"Ercal-Ozkaya, Gunes",2008,THES,Ph.D.,reviewer1,Andreas

,The Effects Of Shared Activity On Dyadic Stress Response.,"Scope and Method of Study: The purpose of this study was to assess sex differences in stress responses to cooperative and competitive activities within same-sex dyads. Participants included 90 undergraduate college students. Salivary cortisol (CORT) was collected as a measure of stress reactivity in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Salivary alpha- amylase (sAA) was collected as a measure of stress reactivity in the sympathetic nervous system. Findings and Conclusions: Data were analyzed using a 2 X 2 analysis of variance, with condition (cooperative activity, competitive activity) and sex (male, female) as independent variables and salivary cortisol (CORT) and alpha-amylase (sAA) as the dependent variables. Results indicated a significant interaction between sex and condition for change in CORT from time 1 (baseline measurement) to time 2 (measurement immediately following shared activity). There was a significant difference in rate of CORT change from time 1 to time 2 for women in cooperative condition compared to the competitive condition. Specifically, women engaging in cooperative activity showed greater decreases in CORT from time 1 to time 2 than women engaging in competitive activity. There was no significant change in CORT for men during cooperative or competitive activity.

,"Violent Video Games: Aggression, Arousal, And Desensitization In Young Adolescent Boys (Unpublished Doctoral Dissertation).","Video games pervade the lives of today''s children and adolescents. With video games becoming increasingly violent and realistic, it is important to assess their impact. Thus, the purpose of this study was to test the effect of playing violent video games on children''s aggression, arousal, and desensitization to violence. One hundred and twenty-four male sixth- through eighth-graders were randomly assigned to play either a violent video game, a nonviolent video game, or to a control condition where subjects played a simple puzzle. The independent measures consisted of game played, past video game experience, and baseline aggression. The dependent measures consisted of aggression, arousal, and desensitization. Baseline levels of projective aggression were measured with the Child Hostility Inventory (CHI) and post-treatment levels of projective aggression were measured with the Multiple Adjective Check List (MACL). Post-treatment behavioral aggression was measured by the intensity of noxious noise delivered to an opponent in a competitive game. Physiological arousal (heart rate) was monitored with a pulse meter at designated times throughout the experimental conditions. Desensitization did demonstrate that past play experience was related to post-treatment behavioral aggression even when initial levels of aggression were controlled, but was not related to arousal or desensitization. Also demonstrated was that baseline aggression was related to behavioral and projective aggression.
The results are discussed within the context of some of the prominent theories of the transmission of aggressive behavior via violent media, specifically social learning theory and drive theory. Social learning theory was found to be a valuable framework for understanding the effect of video games on children and adolescents. Implications for research on video games are discussed.",no_id,anderson2010_87,anderson2010,"Cohn, L. B. (1995).

,"Walker, M. R. (1984). The Effects Of Video Games And Tv/Film Violence On Subsequent Aggression In Male Adolescents (Unpublished Doctoral Dissertation). University Of Southern Mississippi.","In the last 10 years, video games have become a five billion dollar industry. A recent Newsweek article quoted ""industry estimates"" that 90% of the customers are men and boys, and 80% are teenagers. Proponents say that video games are creating an entire generation familiar and comfortable with computers, whereas opponents have been particularly concerned over the possibility that video games may make children too willing to accept or even to copy real violence. One basis for this concern has been the large body of research linking exposure to violence on television with the instigation, frequency, and intensity of aggression in young viewers. The present study compared the effects on subsequent aggression of viewing a violent film on TV with playing a home video game in late adolescent boys who had been angered. Anger was provoked by insulting the subject's performance and aggression was studied in terms of resistance to interference from stress, expressed feelings of hostility, personality traits of aggressiveness and hostility, and behavioral manifestations of aggression. The subjects were 60 male adolescents age 18 and 19 enrolled in undergraduate classes. The subjects watched a segment from the film Rocky II, watched a video tape of a jazz trio, or played Space Invaders for about 13 minutes, and then completed the dependent measures. The major predictions of this study were not borne out as only 1 of the 15 hypotheses was supported by the data. The anger manipulation, the neutral film, and the measure of aggression were discussed as possible explanations for the lack of significant results. The impact of the anger manipulation may have been to produce a sense of failure and depression rather than anger. The aggression measure may have reflected a global evaluation of the experiment and did not require aggression by the subjects. The ""neutral"" film was rated as low-key and boring and may have magnified the impact of the anger manipulation in comparison to the video game and violent film conditions. The issue of the relative importance of video games or violence on TV as precursors of real-life violence is discussed.",no_id,anderson2010_151,anderson2010,"Walker, M. R. (1984).

,Young Offenders And The Media: Viewing Habits And Preferences.,"In 1993, the British Board of Film Classification commissioned the Policy Studies Institute to initiate the first independent research study in more than 20 years into the television and video viewing habits of juvenile offenders. A representative sample was chosen, based on three or more arrests in 1992 of offenders aged between 10 and 17. They were asked to say what they watch, where and how they watch it, and what attracts them to it. The study also aimed to know to what extent young people who have been involved in crime actively seek out and enjoy representations of crime or violence. The book provides information on which to base a more balanced discussion of the viewing of crime and violence by young offenders. Because of the lack of consensus over possible links between violence on the screen and aggressive behaviour in viewers, debate about young offenders and their media use is frequently conducted at the level of assertion and assumption. The study reports the findings of research that compares the viewing habits and preferences of young offenders and schoolchildren of the same age. It examines what young people read, what they watch on television, on video and at the cinema, and the extent of their video game playing.",no_id,anderson2010_114,anderson2010,"Hagell, A., & Newburn, T.

,[Evaluation Of The Characteristics Of Addiction To Online Video Games Among Adolescents And Young Adults].,"The objectives of this study are to assess the social characteristics, coping strategies, self-esteem and depressive symptoms in a population-dependent and not dependent on video games online, in order to investigate the correlations existing between these characteristics. The study was conducted among 193 subjects. Data were collected through a global questionnaire constituted of several scales. The global questionnaire consisted of a sociodemographic part (age, sex, social status, most played game, number of hours per week devoted to the game), a questionnaire assessing dependence and abuse according to the DSM -IV-TR, the feeling of social belonging scale (or ESAS which was doubled to collect information about the belonging in real life and virtual life), the Ways of coping check-list (WCCL), the Rosenberg self-esteem scale (EES), the Quality of interpersonal relations scale (EQRI), the UCLA Loneliness scale and the Center for epidemiologic studies depression scale (CES-D). The questionnaire was broadcasted on the Internet, specifically in the forums dedicated to ""massively multiplayer online role-playing games"" and in young people's forums in specific subject headings. The results show that there are significant differences between the two populations, especially regarding the social characteristics, depressive symptoms, self-esteem and coping strategies. In the entire population, 66 subjects (42%) were considered dependent on online video games and 92 subjects (58%) were not considered dependent. In the dependent population, the number of hours spent playing per week, the score of social belonging in the virtual life, the coping focused on the emotion, the score of loneliness or social isolation and the score obtained on the CES-D appeared more important than the scores obtained by the non-dependent. Moreover, the average age, the scores of social belonging in real life, self-esteem and sub-dimensions ""family"" and ""friends"" of the quality of interpersonal relations scale are lower than those obtained by the non-dependent. Furthermore, the number of hours of play per week, the feeling of social belonging, self-esteem, quality of family relationships and loneliness are predictive factors of addiction to video games online. These results suggest that one of the crucial issues in dependence is the monitoring of game practice. Indeed, dependence on video games is based on a real hardware that needs to be controlled and managed by a third party before the emergence of a dependency. Therefore the results of this study suggest the establishment of better prevention, especially among parents who are confronted in majority with a world and a technology that is unknown or too complicated. In the case of a proven addiction, the study proposes care therapy focused on the social link, especially the family link, and a particular care to work on self-esteem.",doi,10.1016/j.encep.2010.06.006,pubmed,L'Encephale,"Schmit, S; Chauchard, E; Chabrol, H; Sejourne, N",2012,NA,NA,reviewer2,Andreas

,"A Comparison Of Energy Expenditure During ""Wii Boxing"" Versus Heavy Bag Boxing In Young Adults","Traditional computer videogames are sedentary, whereas new computer videogames, such as the Nintendo® (Redmond, WA) ""Wii™ Sports"" games, allow users to physically interact while playing the sport. Energy expenditure (EE), heart rate (HR), and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) during heavy bag boxing versus the Nintendo ""Wii Boxing"" game were compared. Fifteen males and 14 females (mean age, 25.6 years; height, 171.3 cm; weight, 71.8 kg) randomly selected (by a coin toss) heavy bag boxing or ""Wii Boxing"" for their first test session and completed the other protocol at their second session at least 2 days later. Each session lasted for a total duration of 30 minutes and consisted of 10 3-minute exercise bouts with measurements of HR, RPE, and EE obtained from indirect calorimetry. A paired-samples t test was used to analyze the results. Significant differences were found for HR (bag, 156 beats per minute; Wii, 138 beats per minute; P=0.001) and RPE (bag, 13.8; Wii, 11.4; P=0.0001) but not for EE (bag, 8.0 kcal/minute; Wii, 7.1 kcal/minute; bag, 241 total kcal; Wii, 213 total kcal; P=0.078). The results suggest that computer active videogames, such as the Nintendo Wii, have the potential to provide similar EE as their traditional forms of exercise and may be a sufficient replacement for traditional target HR zone activities, especially in less fit individuals.

,A Framework For Collaborative Computing And Multi-Sensor Data Fusion In Body Sensor Networks,"Body Sensor Networks (BSNs) have emerged as the most effective technology enabling not only new e-Health methods and systems but also novel applications in human-centered areas such as electronic health care, fitness/welness systems, sport performance monitoring, interactive games, factory workers monitoring, and social physical interaction. Despite their enormous potential, they are currently mostly used only to monitor single individuals. Indeed, BSNs can proactively interact and collaborate to foster novel BSN applications centered on collaborative groups of individuals. In this paper, C-SPINE, a framework for Collaborative BSNs (CBSNs), is proposed. CBSNs are BSNs able to collaborate with each other to fulfill a common goal. They can support the development of novel smart wearable systems for cyberphysical pervasive computing environments. Collaboration therefore relies on interaction and synchronization among the CBSNs and on collaborative distributed computing atop the collaborating CBSNs. Specifically, collaboration is triggered upon CBSN proximity and relies on service-specific protocols allowing for managing services among the collaborating CBSNs. C-SPINE also natively supports multi-sensor data fusion among CBSNs to enable joint data analysis such as filtering, time-dependent data integration and classification. To demonstrate its effectiveness, C-SPINE is used to implement e-Shake, a collaborative CBSN system for the detection of emotions. The system is based on a multi-sensor data fusion schema to perform automatic detection of handshakes between two individuals and capture of possible heart-rate-based emotion reactions due to the individuals' meeting. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

,A Game Theoretical Based System Using Holt-Winters And Genetic Algorithm With Fuzzy Logic For Dos/Ddos Mitigation On Sdn Networks,"The ever expanding the usage of cloud computing environments, connected applications and Internet of Things-based devices have progressively increased the amount of data that travels through our networks. Software-defined network (SDN) is an emergent paradigm that aims to support next-generation networks through its flexible and powerful management mechanisms. One of the biggest threats faced by these services nowadays is security management. Attacks based on the denial of service (DoS) are particularly efficient against this paradigm due to its centralized control characteristic. Once this controlling system receives a massive amount of malicious requests, the overall performance of the network operation is impaired. Although several researches propose to address this problem, most of them are reactive approaches, detecting the attacks and warning the network administrators, i.e., after the network is already compromised. This paper presents an autonomic DoS/DDoS defensive approach for SDNs called Game Theory (GT)-Holt-Winters for Digital Signature (HWDS), which unites the anomaly detection and identification provided by an HWDS system with an autonomous decision-making model based on GT. Real collected data and simulated attacks are used by the system to measure its effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, we also use a heuristic Fuzzy-GADS method for anomaly detection instead of HWDS, aiming to compare the achieved performance and evaluate the behavior of the presented game theoretical approaches a standalone mitigation module. © 2017 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2702341,Scopus,IEEE Access,"De Assis M.V.O., Hamamoto A.H., Abrao T., Proenca M.L.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,A Methodology Of Integrating Knowledge Into Applied Game And Validation Of Education And Entertainment Effects,"Applied game aims to help player accumulate knowledge, improve skills, or enhance emotion quotient through game playing process. Although many applied games have been developed in education and training fields, the solution on issues of balance between education and entertainment is still open. This study proposes a methodology for integrating knowledge with applied game combining recreational functions and pedagogic effect. For the purpose, the unified representation based on ontology is employed for game elements, game challenge model and knowledge expression with which the relationship mapping mechanism from diverse categories of knowledge onto game atomic element, especially primary rule, is constructed. As a result, a practical design technique that facilitates to import knowledge into applied game is achieved. In order to verify the practicability, a case of applied game, Qbaby Picture Matching game is designed and developed based on the proposed method. It has been running online and applied in a kindergarten. Moreover, an experiment is performed to identify the effects of education and entertainment. The results imply that the game can definitely produce recreational functions and pedagogic effect. The fact indirectly verifies that the methodology may effectively integrate knowledge with game thereby providing a referable solution for issues of education and entertainment balance. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2016.",doi,10.1007/978-3-662-50544-1_2,Scopus,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),"Wang Q., Chen H., Li J., Zhu D.",2016,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,A Missed Penalty Kick Triggered Coronary Death In The Husband And Broken Heart Syndrome In The Wife,"Events that induce emotional stress and frustration in a large number of subjects under specific circumstances, such as earthquakes, war conditions, and sporting occasions, may increase the incidence of cardiovascular events, such as acute myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death. This report describes a married couple who expressed an apparently passionate interest in football with hazardous consequences after a tense football match during the FIFA 2014 World Championships. A series of emotional stressors initiated by defeat in this football game lead to cardiac arrest in a 58-year-old man caused by a thrombotic occlusion of the left anterior descending artery and ending in the death of the patient. An hour and 15 minutes after the onset of cardiac arrest of the patient, his 64-year-old wife also had chest pain caused by an acute midventricular takotsubo syndrome. She survived the acute stage of the disease, and there was complete resolution of the left ventricular dysfunction. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

,A Motivational Framework For Analyzing Player And Virtual Agent Behavior,"Today's digital entertainment industry uses different approaches to establish believable agents with personality and to analyze the goal-directed behavior of game players. Academic research in this area usually focuses on one facet of personality - for example, only on emotions or character traits. The techniques applied to create non-player characters can hardly be used to analyze player interactions or choices in a computer game. The present study proposes a motivational framework to predict goal-directed behavior of both player and non-player characters in a computer game and explores the opportunities of using a Player and Agent Personality Database (PAPD) based on the same motivational framework to design virtual agents with personality. This article claims that motivation to reach a goal is influenced by both situational and personal factors that are represented with an equation that determines the likelihood of the occurrence of a behavior. The framework represented by this study takes into account psychological needs, interactions between these needs, general behavioral patterns, lower-order and higher-order personality traits for analyzing gaming experiences and player/non-player choices in a computer game. © 2010 International Federation for Information Processing.",doi,10.1016/j.entcom.2010.09.002,Scopus,Entertainment Computing,Bostan B.,2009,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,A Negative Association Between Video Game Experience And Proactive Cognitive Control,"Some evidence demonstrates that video game experience has a beneficial effect on visuospatial cognition. In contrast, other evidence indicates that video game experience may be negatively related to cognitive control. In this study we examined the specificity of the influence of video game experience on cognitive control. Participants with high and low video game experience performed the Stroop task while event-related brain potentials were recorded. The behavioral data revealed no difference between high and low gamers for the Stroop interference effect and a reduction in the conflict adaptation effect in high gamers. The amplitude of the medial frontal negativity and a frontal slow wave was attenuated in high gamers, and there was no effect of gaming status on the conflict slow potential. These data lead to the suggestion that video game experience has a negative influence on proactive, but not reactive, cognitive control. © 2009 Society for Psychophysiological Research.",doi,10.1111/j.1469-8986.2009.00925.x,Scopus,Psychophysiology,"Bailey K., West R., Anderson C.A.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,A Neural Marker Of Costly Punishment Behavior,"Human readiness to incur personal costs to punish norm violators is a key force in the maintenance of social norms. The willingness to punish is, however, characterized by vast individual heterogeneity that is poorly understood. In fact, this heterogeneity has so far defied explanations in terms of individual-level demographic or psychological variables. Here, we use resting electroencephalography, a stable measure of individual differences in cortical activity, to show that a highly specific neural marker-baseline cortical activity in the right prefrontal cortex-predicts individuals' punishment behavior. The analysis of task-independent individual variation in cortical baseline activity provides a new window into the neurobiology of decision making by bringing dispositional neural markers to the forefront of the analysis. © The Author(s) 2010.",doi,10.1177/0956797609360750,Scopus,Psychological Science,"Knoch D., Gianotti L.R.R., Baumgartner T., Fehr E.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,A Pilot Study Using The Xbox Kinect For Exercise Conditioning In Sedentary Female University Students,"BACKGROUND: There is little research exploring training effects of engaging in active video gaming activities. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine the cardiovascular and metabolic responses, changes in flexibility and exercise adherence to an aerobic dance exercise programme using the XBOX Kinect over a 6 week training period. METHODS: Training was conducted using the Just Dance 4 disc on the XBOX Kinect 360. Participants attended five, 30 minute sessions per week for the first two weeks, four 45 minute sessions per week for the next two weeks and three 60 minute sessions per week for the last two weeks. Outcomes assessed included flexibility, body mass index (BMI), percentage body fat, maximal oxygen consumption (VO<inf>2max</inf>), resting and post exercise blood pressure, heart rate and blood lactate levels. RESULTS: There were significant improvements in flexibility, maximal oxygen consumption and resting heart rate. There were no significant changes in BMI, percentage body fat or blood lactate levels. Nine (37.5%) participants continued to engage in this form of exercise at least 3-days per week over the 3-month post intervention follow-up period. CONCLUSION: Engaging in dancing using dance videogames can lead to improved cardiovascular conditioning and flexibility in sedentary female university students. © 2015 IOS Press and the authors.

,A Preliminary Study On Pupil Size Changes Detection On Mental Stress With Mental Stressor,"This is a study on measuring the effect of stress that stimulated by the different difficulty of game level on pupil dilation. Playing games are claimed a method to distress in the community, however, this activity is enhancing stress level? The effect of the game playing on the changes of pupil dilation is unknown. An investigation was conducted on relating the changes of pupil diameter measurement at the different difficulty levels of the game. A simple tool was developed by using a webcam as image acquisition device together with MATLAB Image Processing Tool to analyze the acquired images. Here, experiments on the pupil detection algorithm, which consisted of four different methods are to work alternatively with one another and to provide higher chances of pupil detection. 10 subjects were involved in the experiments, which they were requested to play a selected game with four different ascending increased in difficulties, meanwhile, pupil size changes were measured simultaneously. The selected game served as a stress stimulus to the subjects. The result showed a positive proportional relationship between increased in game difficulty levels and pupil dilation. The investigation reported that the pupil dilated when the difficulty of game level increased. Limitation of this study is the sample size on the prototype testing should be increased to concrete the outcome. © 2017 National Taiwan University.",doi,10.4015/S1016237217500119,Scopus,"Biomedical Engineering - Applications, Basis and Communications","Lee P.F., Lee K.S.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,A Robot Learns The Facial Expressions Recognition And Face/Non-Face Discrimination Through An Imitation Game,"In this paper, we show that a robotic system can learn online to recognize facial expressions without having a teaching signal associating a facial expression with a given abstract label (e.g., ‘sadness’, ‘happiness’). Moreover, we show that recognizing a face from a non-face can be accomplished autonomously if we imagine that learning to recognize a face occurs after learning to recognize a facial expression, and not the opposite, as it is classically considered. In these experiments, the robot is considered as a baby because we want to understand how the baby can develop some abilities autonomously. We model, test and analyze cognitive abilities through robotic experiments. Our starting point was a mathematical model showing that, if the baby uses a sensory motor architecture for the recognition of a facial expression, then the parents must imitate the baby’s facial expression to allow the online learning. Here, a first series of robotic experiments shows that a simple neural network model can control a robot head and can learn online to recognize the facial expressions of the human partner if he/she imitates the robot’s prototypical facial expressions (the system is not using a model of the face nor a framing system). A second architecture using the rhythm of the interaction first allows a robust learning of the facial expressions without face tracking and next performs the learning involved in face recognition. Our more striking conclusion is that, for infants, learning to recognize a face could be more complex than recognizing a facial expression. Consequently, we emphasize the importance of the emotional resonance as a mechanism to ensure the dynamical coupling between individuals, allowing the learning of increasingly complex tasks. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",doi,10.1007/s12369-014-0245-z,Scopus,International Journal of Social Robotics,"Boucenna S., Gaussier P., Andry P., Hafemeister L.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,A Selection Of Recent Advances In Networked Multivehicle Systems,"Autonomous vehicle systems have been the topic of much research owing to their ability to perform dangerous, repetitive and automated tasks in remote or hazardous environments. The potential for multivehicle systems cooperating together to accomplish given tasks is starting to draw together researchers from several fields, including robotics, control systems, and computer science. Using selected case studies as a motivation, this paper examines emerging results in networked multivehicle systems. Recent work has taken many different directions, such as hybrid systems, distributed control, differential games, control architectures, and artificial intelligence. The focus of this paper is on the control systems perspective. An attempt is made to present some current issues common to networked multivehicle systems, and to show how they have been solved to date in the perspective of the case studies. © IMechE 2005.",doi,10.1243/095440705X9425,Scopus,Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers.

,A Serious Videogame As An Additional Therapy Tool For Training Emotional Regulation And Impulsivity Control In Severe Gambling Disorder,"Background: Gambling disorder (GD) is characterized by a significant lack of self-control and is associated with impulsivity-related personality traits. It is also linked to deficits in emotional regulation and frequently co-occurs with anxiety and depression symptoms. There is also evidence that emotional dysregulation may play a mediatory role between GD and psychopathological symptomatology. Few studies have reported the outcomes of psychological interventions that specifically address these underlying processes. Objectives: To assess the utility of the Playmancer platform, a serious video game, as an additional therapy tool in a CBT intervention for GD, and to estimate pre-post changes in measures of impulsivity, anger expression and psychopathological symptomatology. Method: The sample comprised a single group of 16 male treatment-seeking individuals with severe GD diagnosis. Therapy intervention consisted of 16 group weekly CBT sessions and, concurrently, 10 additional weekly sessions of a serious video game. Pre-post treatment scores on South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS), Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11), I7 Impulsiveness Questionnaire (I7), State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory 2 (STAXI-2), Symptom Checklist-Revised (SCL-90-R), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S-T), and Novelty Seeking from the Temperament and Character Inventory-Revised (TCI-R) were compared. Results: After the intervention, significant changes were observed in several measures of impulsivity, anger expression and other psychopathological symptoms. Dropout and relapse rates during treatment were similar to those described in the literature for CBT. Conclusion: Complementing CBT interventions for GD with a specific therapy approach like a serious video game might be helpful in addressing certain underlying factors which are usually difficult to change, including impulsivity and anger expression. © 2015 Tárrega, Castro-Carreras, Fernández-Aranda, Granero, Giner-Bartolomé, Aymamí, Gómez-Peña, Santamaría, Forcano, Steward, Menchón and Jiménez-Murcia.",doi,10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01721,Scopus,Frontiers in Psychology,"Tárrega S., Castro-Carreras L., Fernández-Aranda F., Granero R., Giner-Bartolomé C., Aymamí N., Gómez-Peña M., Santamaría J.J., Forcano L., Steward T., Menchón J.M., Jiménez-Murcia S.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,A Simulation For A Predator To Pursuit A Prey Based On Energy,"For the predator-prey model, most conventional researches have focused on the food chain. In recent computer game and movies, simulation of natural phenomena has been increased. Realistic simulation is a key to the simulation of natural phenomena. It also comes in as an important role when simulating predator-prey chasing. Various factors must be put into consideration - such as physical condition, emotion of the predator, and the environment of the pursuit - when creating a realistic simulation of predator-prey chasing. It is not easy to simulate by reflecting all factors independently. Thus, this paper assumes that these independent variables are converted in terms of energy for the pursuit. It will simulate the situation of a predator chasing a prey using the ""energy for the pursuit"". To do this, we proposed the consumed energy by using steering force based on Newton's law and the needed energy based on physics theory for a predator to move a distance as maximum velocity. A number of experiments were conducted in order to show the correctness of the proposed energies. Through experiments, this paper illustrates that the proposed energy models are well suited for natural pursuit. © 2014 SERSC.",doi,10.14257/ijmue.2014.9.4.16,Scopus,International Journal of Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering,Lee J.M.,2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,A Social Simulation-Game To Explore Future Co-Ordination In Knowledge Networks At The Amsterdam Police Force,"The 32 autonomous neighbourhood teams of the Amsterdam Police Force need to utilise each other's knowledge and expertise to deal with the variety and complexity of their daily work assignments. However, despite the creation of organisation wide knowledge networks, communication, co-ordination and knowledge sharing between the neighbourhood teams is disappointing. We conducted an action research to investigate how co-ordination in the knowledge networks could be improved with the help of information and communication technologies (ICTs). This article reflects on the choice of co-ordination perspectives and modelling techniques. The above problem is conceptualised and made operational in different ways in research on network co-ordination, knowledge co-ordination and co-ordination of distributed work. The article demonstrates how our initial focus on capturing quantitative measures of the co-ordination problem in a computer simulation was problematic in this case. Instead a social simulation-game that focused on the qualitative issues of this co-ordination problem was developed and played. We conclude that the choice of theoretical perspectives and modelling techniques strongly affected the results of both phases of our action research. Furthermore the article argues that more attention to qualitative issues in co-ordination is required to better understand the impact of ICT-support on co-ordination.",doi,10.1080/09537280600866611,Scopus,Production Planning and Control,"Van Laere J., De Vreede G.J., Sol H.G.",2006,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,"A Study Investigating The Acute Dose-Response Effects Of 13 Mg And 17 Mg Δ 9- Tetrahydrocannabinol On Cognitive-Motor Skills, Subjective And Autonomic Measures In Regular Users Of Marijuana","Heavy use of marijuana is claimed to damage critical skills related to short-term memory, visual scanning and attention. Motor skills and driving safety may be compromised by the acute effects of marijuana. The aim of this study was to investigate the acute effects of 13 mg and 17 mg Δ 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on skills important for coordinated movement and driving and on subjective and autonomic measures in regular users of marijuana. Fourteen regular users of marijuana were enrolled. Each subject was tested on two separate days. On each test day, subjects smoked two low-nicotine cigarettes, one with and the other without THC. Seventeen mg THC was included in the cigarette on one test day and 13 mg on the other day. The sequence of cigarette types was unknown to the subject. During smoking, heart rate and blood pressure were monitored, and the subjects performed a virtual reality maze task requiring attention and motor coordination, followed by 3 other cognitive tasks (Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), a ""gambling"" task and estimation of time and distance from an approaching car). After smoking a cigarette with 17 mg THC, regular marijuana users hit the walls more often on the virtual maze task than after smoking cigarettes without THC; this effect was not seen in patients after they smoked cigarettes with 13 mg THC. Performance in the WCST was affected with 17 mg THC and to a lesser extent with the use of 13 mg THC. Decision making in the gambling task was affected after smoking cigarettes with 17 mg THC, but not with 13 m THC. Smoking cigarettes with 13 and 17 mg THC increased subjective ratings of pleasure and satisfaction, drug ""effect"" and drug ""high"". Thes findings imply that smoking of 17 mg THC results in impairment of cognitive-motor skills that could be important for coordinated movemen and driving, whereas the lower dose of 13 mg THC appears to cause less impairment of such skills in regular users of marijuana. © 2008 British Association for Psychopharmacology.",doi,10.1177/0269881108088194,Scopus,Journal of Psychopharmacology,"Weinstein A., Brickner O., Lerman H., Greemland M., Bloch M., Lester H., Chisin R., Sarne Y., Mechoulam R., Bar-Hamburger R., Freedman N., Even-Sapir E.",2008,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,A Tactile Luminous Floor For An Interactive Autonomous Space,"This paper describes the interactive tactile luminous floor that was constructed and used as the skin of the playful interactive space Ada, which ran as a public exhibit for five months in 2002 and had over 550,000 visitors. Ada's floor was custom-built to provide a means for individual and collective user interaction. It consists of 360 hexagonal 66 cm tiles covering a total area of 136 m2, each with analogue tactile load sensors based on force-sensitive resistors and dimmable neon red, green and blue (RGB) lamps. The tiles are constructed from extruded aluminum with glass tops. An Interbus factory automation bus senses and controls the tiles. Software is described for rendering fluid, dynamic visual effects on the floor, for signal processing of the load information, for real-time visitor tracking and for a variety of behavioural modes, games and interactions. Data from single tiles and from tracking are shown. This floor offers new modalities of human-computer interaction and human-robot interaction for autonomous robotic spaces. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

,Action Video Game Players' Visual Search Advantage Extends To Biologically Relevant Stimuli,"Research investigating the effects of action video game experience on cognition has demonstrated a host of performance improvements on a variety of basic tasks. Given the prevailing evidence that these benefits result from efficient control of attentional processes, there has been growing interest in using action video games as a general tool to enhance everyday attentional control. However, to date, there is little evidence indicating that the benefits of action video game playing scale up to complex settings with socially meaningful stimuli - one of the fundamental components of our natural environment. The present experiment compared action video game player (AVGP) and non-video game player (NVGP) performance on an oculomotor capture task that presented participants with face stimuli. In addition, the expression of a distractor face was manipulated to assess if action video game experience modulated the effect of emotion. Results indicate that AVGPs experience less oculomotor capture than NVGPs; an effect that was not influenced by the emotional content depicted by distractor faces. It is noteworthy that this AVGP advantage emerged despite participants being unaware that the investigation had to do with video game playing, and participants being equivalent in their motivation and treatment of the task as a game. The results align with the notion that action video game experience is associated with superior attentional and oculomotor control, and provides evidence that these benefits can generalize to more complex and biologically relevant stimuli. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",doi,10.1016/j.actpsy.2015.06.001,Scopus,Acta Psychologica,"Chisholm J.D., Kingstone A.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Active Video Game Playing In Children And Adolescents With Cystic Fibrosis: Exercise Or Just Fun?,"BACKGROUND: Xbox Kinect has been proposed as an exercise intervention in cystic fibrosis (CF), but its potential has not been compared with standard training modalities. METHODS: Using a crossover design, subjects were randomized to 2 intervention groups: Xbox Kinect and a traditional stationary cycle. Heart rate, SpO2, dyspnea, and fatigue were measured. Subject satisfaction was tested. RESULTS: Thirty subjects with CF (11 males, mean ± SD age of 12 ± 2.5 y, mean ± SD FEV1 of 73 ± 16% of predicted) were enrolled. Xbox Kinect provided a cardiovascular demand similar to a stationary cycle, although the modality was different (interval vs continuous). Maximum heart rates were similar (P =.2). Heart rate target was achieved more frequently with a stationary cycle (P =.02). Xbox Kinect caused less dyspnea (P =.001) and fatigue (P &lt;.001) and was more enjoyable than a stationary cycle (P &lt;.001). CONCLUSIONS: Subjects preferred Xbox Kinect for its interactivity. Xbox Kinect has the potential to be employed as an exercise intervention in young subjects with CF, but investigation over longer periods is needed. © 2015 Daedalus Enterprises.",doi,10.4187/respcare.03576,Scopus,Respiratory Care,"Salonini E., Gambazza S., Meneghelli I., Tridello G., Sanguanini M., Cazzarolli C., Zanini A., Assael B.M.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Active Video Games As A Form Of Exercise And The Effect Of Gaming Experience: A Preliminary Study In Healthy Young Adults,"Objectives: To examine the energy expenditure and heart rate response while playing active video games, and the effect of gaming experience on energy expenditure. Design: Cross-sectional study. Participants and interventions: Twenty-eight healthy participants (18 male, age 19 to 27 years) played either Wii Sports Boxing, Tennis and Baseball, or Wii Sports Boxing and Wii Fit Free Jogging. Main outcome measures: Percentage maximal heart rate (%HRmax) and metabolic equivalents (METs) were measured during 15. minutes of rest and during each game. Results: Mean %HRmax and METs while playing each of the four games were as follows: Wii Fit Free Jogging 71% [standard deviation (SD) 13%], 5.9 (SD 1.8); Wii Sports Boxing 58% (SD 13%), 3.2 (SD 1.1); Wii Sports Baseball 42% (SD 6%), 2.0 (SD 0.5); and Wii Sports Tennis 42% (SD 7%), 2.0 (SD 0.4). Subjects with gaming experience achieved a lower heart rate playing Wii Sports Tennis compared with subjects without gaming experience. Conclusions: Wii Sports Boxing, Tennis and Baseball are light-intensity activities, and Wii Fit Free Jogging is a moderate-intensity activity.

,Active Video Gaming In Patients With Renal Transplant: A Pilot Study.,"Patients with renal transplant are at higher risk of mortality from cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared with the general population. Physical activity has been shown to reduce the risk of CVD mortality in these patients. Unfortunately, barriers such as the harsh Canadian climate prevent patients from engaging in and harvesting the health benefits of physical activity. This pilot study explored active video gaming (AVG) as a way for patients with renal transplant to obtain physical activity and examined its effect on their functional status and quality of life (QOL). We recruited nine patients for an 8-week prospective pilot study. All patients received a Microsoft Xbox 360™ video gaming console, a Microsoft Kinect™ sensor, and the video game Your Shape Fitness Evolved 2012. Assessment of each participant before and after the intervention included blood pressure measures, a 6-minute walk test, and the Godin Leisure Time Questionnaire (GLTQ). We analyzed all nine patients at the end of the 8-week study period, and found no changes in blood pressure or GLTQ scores. However, there was a significant increase in the 6-minute walk distance (P = 0.022), which represented a consistent increase for most patients (correlation = 0.977). In addition, participants over the age of 45 years (n = 4) were more likely to use the AVG system (P = 0.042). AVG has the potential to improve the functional status in patients with renal transplant. Further research is required to corroborate the full health benefits of AVG in this patient population.",doi,10.1186/2047-1440-3-15,pubmed,Transplantation research,"Wang, Dorothy Wei Yun; Sills, Laura L; MacDonald, Sara B; Maianski, Ziv; Alwayn, Ian",2014,NA,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Actor Bots,"In many recent computer games there has been an increased use of Non-Player Characters as quest givers, tradesmen, members of the general public and as quest companions for the players. All these roles call for intelligent bots that can give the player an engaging experience by adjusting and adapting to the players' style of play. They need to behave as actors in a virtual improvisational theatre. They need to perform in a manner that the player finds believable and engaging so that the player becomes sufficiently immersed in the interactive drama and keeps coming back for more. The bot's intelligence needs to be both robust to respond to player actions and sufficiently complex to handle character traits, emotions and complex decision making that resembles that of a human player. A balance needs to be maintained between the bots' believability and their entertainment value for the player, as these two goals may be at odds in some situations. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

,Acute Effects Of Video-Game Playing Versus Television Viewing On Stress Markers And Food Intake In Overweight And Obese Young Men: A Randomised Controlled Trial,"Background Sedentary or near-sedentary activities are associated with overweight/obesity in epidemiological studies. This has traditionally been attributed to physical activity displacement. A little-explored area is whether behavioural stresses alter sensations of appetite and eating behaviour. We examined whether behaviours conducted seated (television viewing, video gaming) induce different eating patterns, associated with differential levels of stress response. Methods and findings We conducted a randomized controlled trial in 72 overweight/obese adult males, assigned to three groups (24 per group): (i) non-violent television (control group); (ii) non-violent game (FIFA); (iii) violent game (Call of Duty). Following a standardized breakfast, the 1-h intervention was followed by 25-min rest, with sweet and savoury snacks and drinks available ad libitum. Stress markers (heart rate, blood pressure, visual analogue scale (VAS)) were measured throughout. Heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and stress by VAS were significantly higher (p < 0.05) playing video games than watching non-violent television, though the two game groups did not differ. Considered separately, only the violent video game group consumed more energy (Δ = 208.3 kcal, 95%CI 16, 400), sweet foods (Δ = 25.9 g, 95%CI 9.9, 41.9) and saturated fat (Δ = 4.36 g, 95%CI 0.76, 7.96) than controls. Conclusion Playing video games in overweight/obese adult males is associated with an acute stress response relative to watching non-violent television, associated with greater subsequent food intake. These findings highlight the need to focus on the metabolic effects, as well as the energy costs, of activities involving sitting in relation to obesity risk. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",doi,10.1016/j.appet.2017.08.018,Scopus,Appetite,"Siervo M., Gan J., Fewtrell M.S., Cortina-Borja M., Wells J.C.K.",2018,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,"Aerobic Expenditure During A Tennis Match [Dépense Énergétique Aérobie Au Cours D'un Match De Tennis, Du Laboratoire Au Terrain]","Aim - Measure the oxygen consumption (V̇O2) during a tennis match and to verify whether the heart rate (HR) measured on the field allows to estimate this V̇O2. Maximal oxygen consumption and anaerobic threshold were determined in ten players. Materials and methods - Then each subject played a match for approximately two hours. Ventilatory flow, oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations and heart rate (HR) were measured continuously and oxygen consumption was determined with a portable telemetric ergospirometry system. A video camera was set simultaneously to film the player. Results - Mean V̇O2 reached approximately 60% of the V̇O2 max for 80% of the duration of the match. During the points, HR varied from 70 to 95% of maxHR and decreased rapidly during the changes of side. The evolution of the V̇O2 was similar. The mean V̇O2 was identical to that estimated from the HR measured in the field and the HR/V̇O2 relationship determined at the laboratory. Conclusion - Despite the intermittent nature of the game, tennis induces a moderate but long aerobic expenditure and the HR measured in the field remains a good indicator of the level of the aerobic expenditure. © 2001 éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.",doi,10.1016/S0765-1597(00)00040-X,Scopus,Science and Sports,"Dansou P., Oddou M.F., Delaire M., Therminarias A.",2001,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,"Aerobic Fitness, Psychological Characteristics, And Cardiovascular Reactivity To Stress.","Examined the relations among aerobic fitness (AF), psychological characteristics, and cardiovascular reactivity using 62 men divided into highly fit and less fit groups based on a maximal treadmill exercise test. Several psychological and physiological variables were measured, and subjects' cardiovascular reactivity was assessed during a mental arithmetic task and during a video game task. Highly fit subjects showed a significantly smaller increase in both diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR) and reported themselves to be less anxious and less angry than less fit subjects. Furthermore, controlling for subjects' scores on a scale assessing angry temperament reduced the relationship between AF and DBP reactivity to nonsignificant levels. These results suggest that degree of dispositional anger, which covaries with increased fitness, may contribute to the apparent relationship between AF and DBP--but not HR--reactivity.",doi,10.1037//0278-6133.9.6.676,Scopus,Health Psychology,"Czajkowski S.M., Hindelang R.D., Dembroski T.M., Mayerson S.E., Parks E.B., Holland J.C.",1990,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Affective Learning Analysis Of Children In A Card Sorting Game,The purpose of this paper is to provide an affective learning analysis on children while they were playing a card sorting game. The electroencephalogram (EEG) signals of 8 preschoolers aged between 4 to 6 years were collected (a) while they were playing a card sorting game; and (b) observing affective faces. The features from EEG signals were extracted using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE). The Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) was used to classify and generate the affective maps of the EEG signals while the children were playing the game. The initial results show that the children’s affective states are unique and there might be different affects that drive a child’s performance. This analysis shows the potential of using the affective learning analysis approach in assessing educational tools such as computer games. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.,doi,10.1007/978-3-662-46578-3_80,Scopus,Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering,"Othman M., Wahab A., Qayoom A., Hamzah M.S., Seman M.S.A.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Affective Play With A Recycling Serious Game - A Physiological Study,"the potentials of computer games for developing ‘edutainment’ (education by entertainment) content and services have been widely explored by researchers in recent years. In order to complement existing presentations and create a memorable enjoyable learning experience, computer games are used in current educational practices. They offer educators opportunities to reorganize and conceptualize abstract, complex and technological information or knowledge for young learners. To demonstrate and evaluate how a serious game can facilitate the learning activities in a more constructive and meaningful way, we select a computer game which is about the waste recycling to conduct a user study and investigate the pedagogical effects of this game. While designing this user study, we particularly focus on the link between game play and physiological state of a player as the measurement of his performance. Both quantitative and qualitative data are collected during the study. The results have shown that this game indeed can help learners understand the important knowledge of waste recycling being studied. The study also indicates that physiological signals can be an indicator of his mental state of a player to some extent. Further direction will be adding other physiological measurements like heart rate and etc during a user study. © 2017, UK Simulation Society.

,Aggressive Outcomes And Videogame Play: The Role Of Length Of Play And The Mechanisms At Work,"Recent meta-analytic findings (Sherry, 2007) suggest that the effect of violent video games on aggression tends to decrease the longer participants play. Therefore, it is likely that different mechanisms may be at work depending on the length of play. In this study, we employed a 4 (length of game play) × 2 (sex) design to examine the effect of length of video game play on aggressive outcomes. Findings suggest that length of play may be curvilinearly related to verbal and physical aggression, and that arousal may mediate this response. Implications for our current understanding of the relationship between video games and aggression are discussed, along with directions for further research. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",doi,10.1080/15213260903052257,Scopus,Media Psychology,"Krcmar M., Lachlan K.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Agrivillage: A Game To Foster Awareness Of The Environmental Impact Of Agriculture,"Agriculture, while of uttermost importance for society, may also have a strong negative impact on the environment. Hence we propose a game that offers players the opportunity to experience the effects of different styles of agriculture on the environment. The game was built with the purpose of promoting the awareness of agriculture issues, such as, (1) the impact of fertilizers in sources of fresh water, (2) the problems related to deforestation and impact on the weather, and (3) the importance of balancing environmental and economic perspectives in order to produce food of good quality with low impact on the environment - and at the same time keep the activity sustainable. To make players care about these issues, we added a direct impact of the players' actions on a population of non-player characters, the villagers, whose simple autonomous behaviors resemble that of living entities. The game was implemented in the multi-user online three-dimensional (3-D) virtual world platform Open-Simulator, which supports an immersive user experience and high accessibility. An experiment was performed and showed that the game improved players' knowledge about agriculture and their awareness of the environmental impact of agriculture. 2014 Copyright held by the Owner/Author.",doi,10.1145/2701657.2633417,Scopus,Computers in Entertainment,"Prada R., Prendinger H., Yongyuth P., Nakasoneb A., Kawtrakulc A.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Akbaba-An Agent For The Angry Birds Ai Challenge Based On Search And Simulation,"In this paper, we report on our entry for the AI Birds competition, where we designed, implemented, and evaluated an agent for the physics puzzle computer game Angry Birds. Our agent uses search and simulation to find appropriate parameters for launching birds. While there are other methods that focus on qualitative reasoning about physical systems we try to combine simulation and adjustable abstractions to efficiently traverse the possibly infinite search space. The agent features a hierarchical search scheme where different levels of abstractions are used. At any level, it uses simulation to rate subspaces that should be further explored in more detail on the next levels. We evaluate single components of our agent and we also compare the overall performance of different versions of our agent. We show that our approach yields a competitive solution on the standard set of levels. © 2009-2012 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TCIAIG.2015.2478703,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games,"Schiffer S., Jourenko M., Lakemeyer G.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Algorithms Based On Computational Intelligence For Autonomous Physical Rehabilitation At Home,"Exergames provide efficient and motivating training mechanisms to support physical rehabilitation at home. Nonetheless, current exergame examples lack some important aspects which cannot be disregarded in rehabilitation. Exergames should: (i) modify the game difficulty adapting to patient's gameplay performance, (ii) monitor if the exercise is correctly executed, and (iii) provide continuous motivation. In this study, we present a game engine which implements computer intelligence-based solutions to provide real-time adaptation, on-line monitoring and an engaging gameplay experience. The game engine applies real-time adaptation using the Quest Bayesian approach to modify the game difficulty according to the patient's performance. Besides, it employs a fuzzy system to monitor the execution of the exercises according to the parameters set by the therapists and provides on-line feedback to guide the patient during the execution of the exercise. Finally, a motivating game experience is provided using rewards and adding random enrichments during the game. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",doi,10.1007/978-3-319-18164-6_23,Scopus,"Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies","Borghese N.A., Lanzi P.L., Mainetti R., Pirovano M., Surer E.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Allergen Exposure Modifies The Relation Of Sensitization To Fraction Of Exhaled Nitric Oxide Levels In Children At Risk For Allergy And Asthma,"Background: Studies on airway inflammation, measured as fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (Feno), have focused on its relation to control of asthma, but the contribution of allergen exposure to the increase in Feno levels is unknown. Objective: We evaluated (1) whether Feno levels were increased in children with allergic sensitization or asthma; (2) whether specific allergen exposure increased Feno levels in sensitized, but not unsensitized, children; and (3) whether sedentary behavior increased Feno levels independent of allergen exposures. Methods: At age 12 years, in a birth cohort of children with a parental history of allergy or asthma, we measured bed dust allergen (dust mite, cat, and cockroach) by means of ELISA, specific allergic sensitization primarily based on specific IgE levels, and respiratory disease (current asthma, rhinitis, and wheeze) and hours of television viewing/video game playing by means of questionnaire. Children performed spirometric maneuvers before and after bronchodilator responses and had Feno levels measured by using electrochemical detection methods (NIOX MINO). Results: Feno levels were increased in children with current asthma (32.2 ppb), wheeze (27.0 ppb), or rhinitis (23.2 ppb) compared with subjects without these respective symptoms/diagnoses (16.4-16.6 ppb, P < .005 for all comparisons). Allergic sensitization to indoor allergens (cat, dog, and dust mite) predicted higher Feno levels and explained one third of the variability in Feno levels. Feno levels were highest in children both sensitized and exposed to dust mite. Greater than 10 hours of weekday television viewing was associated with a 0.64-log increase in Feno levels after controlling for indoor allergen exposure, body mass index, and allergic sensitization. Conclusion: Allergen exposures and sedentary behavior (television viewing/video game playing) might increase airway inflammation, which was measured as the Feno. © 2011 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.",doi,10.1016/j.jaci.2011.01.066,Scopus,Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology,"Sordillo J.E., Webb T., Kwan D., Kamel J., Hoffman E., Milton D.K., Gold D.R.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Altered Autonomic Functions And Distressed Personality Traits In Male Adolescents With Internet Gaming Addiction,"Internet gaming addiction (IGA) has been associated with many negative health outcomes, especially for youth; however, few studies have examined the physiological parameters and personality features related to this addiction. This study aimed to identify differences in autonomic functions and distressed (type D) personality traits among Korean adolescent males with and without IGA. In a cross-sectional study, 68 adolescent males were recruited in a Korean city using convenience and snowball sampling methods. For each subject, heart rate variability (HRV) parameters were measured as autonomic functions and questionnaires were used to identify IGA and type D personality traits. Data were analyzed using descriptive analyses, t tests, χ2 tests, and Pearson's correlation. Most HRV parameters significantly differed between the IGA and non-IGA groups (all p &lt; 0.05). Type D personality total and subscale scores, including those for negative affectivity (NA) and social inhibition, were significantly higher in the IGA group (all p &lt; 0.001). Of the 68 subjects, 46 were classified as having type D personality, with nearly twice as many in the IGA group as in the non-IGA group (p = 0.002). Type D personality total scores negatively correlated with the logarithmic value of total power and low frequency among the HRV parameters (both p &lt; 0.05). Results showed that excessive Internet gaming was related to alterations in autonomic functions and distressed personality traits in male adolescents. These findings provide further understanding of the IGA phenomenon and highlight the need for interventions that address male adolescents with IGA. © Copyright 2016, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016.",doi,10.1089/cyber.2016.0282,Scopus,"Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking","Kim N., Hughes T.L., Park C.G., Quinn L., Kong I.D.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Altered Cardiorespiratory Coupling In Young Male Adults With Excessive Online Gaming,"Introduction: This study aimed to investigate changes in heart rate variability and cardiorespiratory coupling in male college students with problematic Internet use (PIU) excessive gaming type during action video game play to assess the relationship between PIU tendency and central autonomic regulation. Method: Electrocardiograms and respiration were simultaneously recorded from 22 male participants with excessive online gaming and 22 controls during action video game play. Sample entropy (SampEn) was computed to assess autonomic regularity, and cross-SampEn was calculated to quantify autonomic coordination. Results: During video game play, reduced cardiorespiratory coupling (CRC) was observed in individuals with PIU excessive gaming type compared with controls, implicating central autonomic dysregulation. The PIU tendency was associated with the severity of autonomic dysregulation. Conclusion: These findings indicate impaired CRC in PIU excessive gaming type, which may reflect alterations of central inhibitory control over autonomic responses to pleasurable online stimuli. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",doi,10.1016/j.biopsycho.2015.07.016,Scopus,Biological Psychology,"Chang J.S., Kim E.Y., Jung D., Jeong S.H., Kim Y., Roh M.-S., Ahn Y.M., Hahm B.-J.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Altered Reward Processing In Pathological Computer Gamers - Erp-Results From A Semi-Natural Gaming-Design,"Introduction: Internet Gaming Disorder has been added as a research diagnosis in section III for the DSM-V. Previous findings from neuroscientific research indicate an enhanced motivational attention toward cues related to computer games, similar to findings in substance-related addictions. On the other hand in clinical observational studies tolerance effects are reported by patients with Internet Gaming disorder. In the present study we investigated whether an enhanced motivational attention or tolerance effects are present in patients with Internet Gaming Disorder. Methods: A clinical sample from the Outpatient Clinic for Behavioral Addictions in Mainz, Germany was recruited, fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for Internet Gaming Disorder. In a semi-natural EEG design participants played a computer game during the recording of event-related potentials to assess reward processing. Results: The results indicated an attenuated P300 for patients with Internet Gaming Disorder in response to rewards in comparison to healthy controls, while the latency of N100 was prolonged and the amplitude of N100 was increased. Conclusions: Our findings support the hypothesis that tolerance effects are present in patients with Internet Gaming Disorder, when actively playing computer games. In addition, the initial orienting toward the gaming reward is suggested to consume more capacity for patients with Internet Gaming Disorder, which has been similarly reported by other studies with other methodological background in disorders of substance-related addictions. © 2014 The Authors.

,Altered Visual Perception In Game Transfer Phenomena: An Empirical Self-Report Study,"The aim of this study was to identify, classify, and explain gamers' perceptual experiences referred to as Visual Game Transfer Phenomena (VGTP) to contribute to the understanding of the effects of post-video-game playing and encourage healthy and safe gaming. A total of 656 experiences from 483 gamers were collected from 54 online gaming forums. The findings suggest that intensive playing can result in misperceptions and visual distortions of real-life objects and environments, stereotypical visual experiences that arise from mind visualization, and pseudo-hallucinatory experiences with video game content. Gamers' experiences can be explained by the interplay of physiological, perceptual, and cognitive mechanisms. Observation of video game features suggests that in most cases a relationship between the games' structural characteristics, gamers' VGTP experiences, and gamers' playing habits appeared relevant. VGTP can occur while gaming, immediately after stopping play, or after some delay. Further VGTP characteristics and their psychosocial implications are discussed. © 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",doi,10.1080/10447318.2013.839900,Scopus,International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction,"Ortiz de Gortari A.B., Griffiths M.D.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Amygdala-Prefrontal Cortex Functional Connectivity During Threat-Induced Anxiety And Goal Distraction,"BACKGROUND: Anxiety produced by environmental threats can impair goal-directed processing and is associated with a range of psychiatric disorders, particularly when aversive events occur unpredictably. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is thought to implement controls that minimize performance disruptions from threat-induced anxiety and goal distraction by modulating activity in regions involved in threat detection, such as the amygdala. The inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and ventromedial PFC (vmPFC) have been linked to the regulation of anxiety during threat exposure. We developed a paradigm to determine if threat-induced anxiety would enhance functional connectivity between the amygdala and IFG, OFC, and vmPFC. METHODS: Healthy adults performed a computer-gaming style task involving capturing prey and evading predators to optimize monetary rewards while exposed to the threat of unpredictable shock. Psychophysiological recording (n 5 26) and functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning (n 5 17) were collected during the task in separate cohorts. Task-specific changes in functional connectivity with the amygdala were examined using psychophysiological interaction analysis. RESULTS: Threat exposure resulted in greater arousal measured by increased skin conductance but did not influence performance (i.e., monetary losses or rewards). Greater functional connectivity between the right amygdala and bilateral IFG, OFC, vmPFC, anterior cingulate cortex, and frontopolar cortex was associated with threat exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to unpredictable threat modulates amygdala-PFC functional connectivity that may help maintain performance when experiencing anxiety induced by threat. Our paradigm is well-suited to explore the neural underpinnings of the anxiety response to unpredictable threat in patients with various anxiety disorders.",doi,10.1016/j.biopsych.2014.03.030,Scopus,Biological Psychiatry,"Gold A.L., Morey R.A., McCarthy G.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,An Annotation Tool For Automatically Triangulating Individuals' Psychophysiological Emotional Reactions To Digital Media Stimuli,"Current affective user experience studies require both laborious and time-consuming data analysis, as well as dedicated affective classification algorithms. Moreover, the high technical complexity and lack of general guidelines for developing these affective classification algorithms further limits the comparability of the obtained results. In this paper we target this issue by presenting a tool capable of automatically annotating and triangulating players' physiologically interpreted emotional reactions to in-game events. This tool was initially motivated by an experimental psychology study regarding the emotional habituation effects of audio-visual stimuli in digital games and we expect it to contribute in future similar studies by providing both a deeper and more objective analysis on the affective aspects of user experience. We also hope it will contribute towards the rapid implementation and accessibility of this type of studies by open-sourcing it. Throughout this paper we describe the development and benefits presented by our tool, which include: enabling researchers to conduct objective a posteriori analyses without disturbing the gameplay experience, automating the annotation and emotional response identification process, and formatted data exporting for further analysis in third-party statistical software applications. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",doi,10.1016/j.entcom.2015.06.003,Scopus,Entertainment Computing,"Nogueira P.A., Torres V., Rodrigues R., Oliveira E.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,An Evolutionary Agent-Based Framework For Modeling And Analysis Of Labor Market,"This paper presents an agent-based model of labor market to investigate the relationship between company and worker. Contrary to most of previous studies of labor market we apply a game theoretic approach to defining entities in labor market: companies and workers. A company can choose the level of wages, and workers can select the level of effort to increase the productivity in response to the wages. Company and worker agents are designed to possess the basic attributes in order to reflect the real labor market and their activities are adaptively changed using evolutionary model. Our approach is illustrated with four simulation results: the effect of workers resignation, sick leave, dismissal of companies, and productivity growth. Various experiments were conducted to analyze the interactions between worker and company, indicating that performance-based reward strategy and non-greedy strategy in job changing are necessary for companies and workers. The experimental results confirm that the balanced power between worker and company is important in maintenance and extension of labor market, and Nash equilibrium can be maintained in all the cases. © 2017",doi,10.1016/j.neucom.2017.01.111,Scopus,Neurocomputing,"Yu J.-M., Cho S.-B.",2018,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,An Online Spaced-Education Game Among Clinicians Improves Their Patients' Time To Blood Pressure Control A Randomized Controlled Trial,"Background-Many patients with high blood pressure (BP) do not have antihypertensive medications appropriately intensified at clinician visits. We investigated whether an online spaced-education (SE) game among primary care clinicians can decrease time to BP target among their hypertensive patients. Methods and Results-A 2-arm randomized trial was conducted over 52 weeks among primary care clinicians at 8 hospitals. Educational content consisted of 32 validated multiple-choice questions with explanations on hypertension management. Providers were randomized into 2 groups: SE clinicians were enrolled in the game, whereas control clinicians received identical educational content in an online posting. SE game clinicians were e-mailed 1 question every 3 days. Adaptive game mechanics resent questions in 12 or 24 days if answered incorrectly or correctly, respectively. Clinicians retired questions by answering each correctly twice consecutively. Posting of relative performance among peers fostered competition. Primary outcome measure was time to BP target (>140/90 mm Hg). One hundred eleven clinicians enrolled. The SE game was completed by 87% of clinicians (48/55), whereas 84% of control clinicians (47/56) read the online posting. In multivariable analysis of 17 866 hypertensive periods among 14 336 patients, the hazard ratio for time to BP target in the SE game cohort was 1.043 (95% confidence interval, 1.007-1.081; P=0.018). The number of hypertensive episodes needed to treat to normalize one additional patient's BP was 67.8. The number of clinicians needed to teach to achieve this was 0.43. Conclusions-An online SE game among clinicians generated a modest but significant reduction in the time to BP target among their hypertensive patients. © 2014 American Heart Association, Inc.",doi,10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.113.000814,Scopus,Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes,"Kerfoot B.P., Turchin A., Breydo E., Gagnon D., Conlin P.R.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Analysing The Influence Of The Fitness Function On Genetically Programmed Bots For A Real-Time Strategy Game,"Finding the global best strategy for an autonomous agent (bot) in a RTS game is a hard problem, mainly because the techniques applied to do this must deal with uncertainty and real-time planning in order to control the game agents. This work describes an approach applying a Genetic Programming (GP) algorithm to create the behavioural engine of bots able to play a simple RTS. Normally it is impossible to know in advance what kind of strategies will be the best in the most general case of this problem. So GP, which searches the general decision tree space, has been introduced and used successfully. However, it is not straightforward what fitness function would be the most convenient to guide the evolutionary process in order to reach the best solutions and also being less sensitive to the uncertainty present in the context of games. Thus, in this paper three different evaluation functions have been proposed, and a detailed analysis of their performance has been conducted. The paper also analyses several aspects of the obtained bots, in addition to their final performance on battles, such as the evolution of the decision trees (behavioural models) themselves, or the influence on the results of noise or uncertainty. The results show that a victory-based fitness, which prioritises the number of victories, contributes to generate better bots, on average, than other functions based on other numerical aspects of the battles, such as the number of resources gathered, or the number of units generated. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",doi,10.1016/j.entcom.2016.08.001,Scopus,Entertainment Computing,"Fernández-Ares A., Mora A.M., García-Sánchez P., Castillo P.A., Merelo J.J.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Analyzing Multi-Agent Approaches For The Design Of Advanced Interactive And Collaborative Systems,"The purpose of this paper is to determine a set of requirements and proposals for the design of a collaborative interactive system working under distributed tangible environments. A wide range of human-machine, human-human and humanenvironment interactions is to be considered, and using multi-agent architectures was recommended since they have already shown their benefits in developing large and complex systems under a unified framework. We further argue that such a design would require an in-depth analysis of four main properties (autonomy, proactiveness, context-awareness, situatedness). In this context, the potential interest and complementarity of two main design approaches (holonic and normative) are discussed. To support this discussion, two applications are also described - a Road Traffic simulation and a version of the game of RISK. Both of these applications introduce complementary man-machine-environment interaction issues. © 2016 IOS Press and the authors.

,Are Violent Video Games Harmful?,"Objective: The aim of this paper is to revisit the controversial issue of the association of violent video games and aggressive behaviour. Conclusions: Several lines of evidence suggest that there is a link between exposure to violent video games and aggressive behaviour. However, methodological shortcomings of research conducted so far make several interpretations of this relationship possible. Thus, aggressive behaviour may be a consequence of playing violent video games, an expression of hostile traits that existed before exposure to these games, and/or it may be a result of several possible combinations of these and other factors. Mental health professionals need to be aware of these potentially negative effects of violent video games when assessing patients who present with aggression. There is a need for prospective, long-term studies similar to those evaluating the effects of television and film violence on children and adolescents.",doi,10.1080/10398560701463343,Scopus,Australasian Psychiatry,"Porter G., Starcevic V.",2007,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Are Women Better Mindreaders? Sex Differences In Neural Correlates Of Mentalizing Detected With Functional Mri,"Background: The ability to mentalize, i.e. develop a Theory of Mind (ToM), enables us to anticipate and build a model of the thoughts, emotions and intentions of others. It has long been hypothesised that women differ from men in their mentalizing abilities. In the present fMRI study we examined the impact of (1) gender (women vs. men) and (2) game partner (human vs. computer) on ToM associated neural activity in the medial prefrontal cortex. Groups of men (n = 12) and women (n = 12) interacted in an iterated classical prisoner's dilemma forced choice situation with alleged human and computer partners who were outside the scanner. Results: Both the conditions of playing against putative human as well as computer partners led to activity increases in mPFC, ACC and rTPJ, constituting the classic ToM network. However, mPFC/ACC activity was more pronounced when participants believed they were playing against the alleged human partner. Differences in the medial frontal lobe activation related to the sex of the participants could be demonstrated for the human partner > computer partner contrast. Conclusion: Our data demonstrate differences in medial prefrontal brain activation during a ToM task depending on both the gender of participants and the game partner. © 2009 Krach et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",doi,10.1186/1471-2202-10-9,Scopus,BMC Neuroscience,"Krach S., Blümel I., Marjoram D., Lataster T., Krabbendam L., Weber J., van Os J., Kircher T.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Artificial Intelligence Approaches For The Generation And Assessment Of Believable Human-Like Behaviour In Virtual Characters,"Having artificial agents to autonomously produce human-like behaviour is one of the most ambitious original goals of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and remains an open problem nowadays. The imitation game originally proposed by Turing constitute a very effective method to prove the indistinguishability of an artificial agent. The behaviour of an agent is said to be indistinguishable from that of a human when observers (the so-called judges in the Turing test) cannot tell apart humans and non-human agents. Different environments, testing protocols, scopes and problem domains can be established to develop limited versions or variants of the original Turing test. In this paper we use a specific version of the Turing test, based on the international BotPrize competition, built in a First-Person Shooter video game, where both human players and non-player characters interact in complex virtual environments. Based on our past experience both in the BotPrize competition and other robotics and computer game AI applications we have developed three new more advanced controllers for believable agents: two based on a combination of the CERA-CRANIUM and SOAR cognitive architectures and other based on ADANN, a system for the automatic evolution and adaptation of artificial neural networks. These two new agents have been put to the test jointly with CCBot3, the winner of BotPrize 2010 competition (Arrabales et al.; 2012), and have showed a significant improvement in the humanness ratio. Additionally, we have confronted all these bots to both First-person believability assessment (BotPrize original judging protocol) and Third-person believability assessment, demonstrating that the active involvement of the judge has a great impact in the recognition of human-like behaviour. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

,Assessing The Physiological Cost Of Active Videogames (Xbox Kinect) Versus Sedentary Videogames In Young Healthy Males,"Objectives: The aims of this study were twofold: (1) to compare the physiological costs of active videogames (AVGs) and sedentary videogames (SVGs) and (2) to compare the exercise intensities attained during AVGs with the exercise intensity criteria for moderate and vigorous physical activity, as stated in current physical activity recommendations for improving public health. Materials and Methods: Nineteen young males participated in the study (age, 23 ± 3 years; height, 178 ± 6 cm; weight, 78 ± 15 kg). Participants completed a maximum oxygen uptake (VO2 max) test and a gaming session, including AVGs (""Reflex Ridge,"" ""River Rush,"" and ""Boxing"" for the Microsoft [Redmond, WA] Kinect™) and SVGs (""FIFA 14"" [Electronic Arts, Burnaby, BC, Canada] and ""Call of Duty"" [Activision, Santa Monica, CA]). Heart rate (HR) and oxygen uptake VO2) were recorded continuously during all videogames. Rating of perceived exertion (RPE) was taken every 3 minutes during AVGs and SVGs. Energy expenditure (EE), expressed as metabolic equivalents (METs), was calculated. One MET was defined as the volume of oxygen consumed at rest in a seated position and is equal to 3.5 mL of O2/kg of body mass/minute. The exercise intensity for each game was expressed as a percentage of VO2 max and percentage of age-predicted maximum HR (HRmax). Results: Exercise intensity (percentage HRmax, percentage VO2 max, and RPE) and EE (METs) were significantly higher during active gaming compared with sedentary gameplay (P &lt; 0.01). AVGs elicited moderate levels of exercise intensity (64-72 percent HRmax) in line with current recommended physical activity guidelines. Conclusions: Our results indicate AVGs provoke physiological responses equivalent to a moderate-intensity physical activity.

,Assessing The Player Interaction Experiences Based On Playability,"Nowadays, video games are the most economically profitable entertainment industry. The nature of their design means that user experience factors make design and/or evaluation difficult using traditional methods commonly used in interactive systems. It is therefore necessary to know how to apply Playability in order to design, analyse, optimise and adapt it to a player's preferences. In this paper, a strong relationship between user experience (UX) and playability is introduced and justified, a characterisation of player experience (PX) is presented based on playability, and a practical method for player experience assessment is described by using the ""Castlevania: Lords of Shadow"" video game to be a. The results offers a mechanism for the evaluation (validation and verification) of the quality of the experience and interaction process and acts as a complementary alternative to the traditional tests performed by the video game industry professionals during the Quality Assurance Process (QA Process) to help to share results, reports and have a global point of view to analyse the final game experience. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",doi,10.1016/j.entcom.2014.08.006,Scopus,Entertainment Computing,"González Sánchez J.L., Gutiérrez Vela F.L.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Assessment Of Spontaneous Emotional Speech Database Toward Emotion Recognition: Intensity And Similarity Of Perceived Emotion From Spontaneously Expressed Emotional Speech,"The spontaneous emotional speech database comprising utterances from dialogs among online game players chatting through a voice chat system was examined. The dialogs among online game players were recorded to collect a wide variety of spontaneously expressed emotional speech. The players were 13 university students with experience in the online game and their average playing time per month was 33 hours and the average month of experience was 38 months. Each group member was asked to participate in game events together as a party to keep talking with each other and asked to use a voice chat system and were prohibited from using a text chat function provided by the online game system when they talked with each other. The voice-recording system for Skype, Tapur, recorded the local player's voice and remote player's voices in individual channels of a stereo sound file. The results showed that intensity and similarity of emotion are two of the components of the emotional space perceived by humans when they listen to emotional speech.",doi,10.1250/ast.32.26,Scopus,Acoustical Science and Technology,"Arimoto Y., Ohno S., Iida H.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Assessment With Computer Agents That Engage In Conversational Dialogues And Trialogues With Learners,"This article describes conversation-based assessments with computer agents that interact with humans through chat, talking heads, or embodied animated avatars. Some of these agents perform actions, interact with multimedia, hold conversations with humans in natural language, and adaptively respond to a person's actions, verbal contributions, and emotions. Data are logged throughout the interactions in order to assess the individual's mastery of subject matters, skills, and proficiencies on both cognitive and noncognitive characteristics. There are different agent-based designs that focus on learning and assessment. Dialogues occur between one agent and one human, as in the case of intelligent tutoring systems. Three-party conversations, called trialogues, involve two agents interacting with a human. The two agents can take on different roles (such as tutors and peers), model actions and social interactions, stage arguments, solicit help from the human, and collaboratively solve problems. Examples of assessment with these agent-based environments are presented in the context of intelligent tutoring, educational games, and interventions to help struggling adult readers. Most of these involve assessment at varying grain sizes to guide the intelligent interaction, but conversation-based assessment with agents is also currently being used in high stakes assessments. © 2017",doi,10.1016/j.chb.2017.03.041,Scopus,Computers in Human Behavior,"Graesser A.C., Cai Z., Morgan B., Wang L.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,"Associations Between Parental Rules, Style Of Communication And Children's Screen Time Health Behavior, Health Promotion And Society","Background: Research suggests an inverse association between parental rules and screen time in pre-adolescents, and that parents' style of communication with their children is related to the children's time spent watching TV. The aims of this study were to examine associations of parental rules and parental style of communication with children's screen time and perceived excessive screen time in five European countries. Methods: UP4FUN was a multi-centre, cluster randomised controlled trial with pre- and post-test measurements in each of five countries; Belgium, Germany, Greece, Hungary and Norway. Questionnaires were completed by the children at school and the parent questionnaire was brought home. Three structural equation models were tested based on measures of screen time and parental style of communication from the pre-test questionnaires. Discussion: Of the 152 schools invited, 62 (41 %) schools agreed to participate. In total 3325 children (average age 11.2 years and 51 % girls) and 3038 parents (81 % mothers) completed the pre-test questionnaire. The average TV/DVD times across the countries were between 1.5 and 1.8 h/day, while less time was used for computer/games console (0.9-1.4 h/day). The children's perceived parental style of communication was quite consistent for TV/DVD and computer/games console. The presence of rules was significantly associated with less time watching TV/DVD and use of computer/games console time. Moreover, the use of an autonomy-supportive style was negatively related to both time watching TV/DVD and use of computer/games console time. The use of a controlling style was related positively to perceived excessive time used on TV/DVD and excessive time used on computer/games console. With a few exceptions, results were similar across the five countries. Conclusions: This study suggests that an autonomy-supportive style of communicating rules for TV/DVD or computer/ games console use is negatively related to children's time watching TV/DVD and use of computer/games console time. In contrast, a controlling style is associated with more screen time and with more perceived excessive screen time in particular. Longitudinal research is needed to further examine effects of parental style of communication on children's screen time as well as possible reciprocal effects.

,Asymmetric Effects Of Positive And Negative Affect On Decision Making,"Although affect is a fundamental element of decision making, there are different theoretical accounts and conflicting empirical evidence of its influence. This experiment was done to begin a more coherent account of the influence of affect by using standardised images to induce affect and a betting task to measure decision making. Eighty-five participants were assigned to a positive, a negative, or a neutral affect condition before making decisions on two hypothetical horse races. Analysis indicated that those in the positive and negative conditions made lower-risk decisions than those in the neutral condition; however, this did not differ between the races, suggesting that task familiarity did not moderate the influence of affect. Contrary to previous research, these results indicate that positive and negative affect do not necessarily exert symmetrical effects on decision making. Implications for the major accounts of the influence of affect on decision making are discussed in relation to the findings. © 2010 Psychological Reports.",doi,10.2466/PR0.106.1.193-204,Scopus,Psychological Reports,"Cahir C., Thomas K.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Attentional Bias In Excessive Internet Gamers: Experimental Investigations Using An Addiction Stroop And A Visual Probe,"Background and aims: Internet Gaming Disorder is included in the Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (5th edition) as a disorder that merits further research. The diagnostic criteria are based on those for Substance Use Disorder and Gambling Disorder. Excessive gamblers and persons with Substance Use Disorder show attentional biases towards stimuli related to their addictions. We investigated whether excessive Internet gamers show a similar attentional bias, by using two established experimental paradigms. Methods: We measured reaction times of excessive Internet gamers and non-gamers (N = 51, 23.7 ± 2.7 years) by using an addiction Stroop with computerrelated and neutral words, as well as a visual probe with computer-related and neutral pictures. Mixed design analyses of variance with the between-subjects factor group (gamer/non-gamer) and the within-subjects factor stimulus type (computer-related/neutral) were calculated for the reaction times as well as for valence and familiarity ratings of the stimulus material. Results: In the addiction Stroop, an interaction for group × word type was found: Only gamers showed longer reaction times to computer-related words compared to neutral words, thus exhibiting an attentional bias. In the visual probe, no differences in reaction time between computer-related and neutral pictures were found in either group, but the gamers were faster overall. Conclusions: An attentional bias towards computer-related stimuli was found in excessive Internet gamers, by using an addiction Stroop but not by using a visual probe. A possible explanation for the discrepancy could lie in the fact that the visual probe may have been too easy for the gamers. © 2016 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest.",doi,10.1556/2006.5.2016.012,Scopus,Journal of Behavioral Addictions,"Jeromin F., Nyenhuis N., Barke A.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Attitude Formation From Product Trial: Distinct Roles Of Cognition And Affect For Hedonic And Functional Products,"Affective and cognitive responses to a product trial are examined in an experiment containing two cells representing two product types: hedonic and functional. The stimulus products were a computer game and grammar-checking software. Forty-two college students comprised the sample for the experiment. The specific affective responses studied are pleasure and arousal, and brand cognitions are represented as the expectancy value from brand attributes (the product of brand beliefs, belief confidence, and attribute evaluations, summed across the attributes (Σ biciei)). The relative level and influence of affective and cognitive responses to a product trial were shown to differ significantly, depending on whether the product was hedonic or functional in nature. Specifically, for the hedonic product, felt arousal during the trial was higher than for the functional product, and emotional responses were significant antecedents of subjects' evaluations of the trial experience. Brand cognitions, however, were not significantly related to trial evaluations for the hedonic product. In contrast, for the functional product, brand cognitions and pleasure were significant antecedents of trial evaluations, but arousal was not. The findings of this study demonstrate the importance of considering both the cognitive structure created by a product trial and the consumer's emotional reactions to the trial. For hedonic products, especially, emotional responses to the trial were shown to be powerful antecedents to consumers' evaluations of a trial experience, and subsequently, brand attitude. Marketers and marketing researchers can use these results to predict which category of responses to product trial (affective or cognitive) will be most important for brand evaluation for the particular product in question. This knowledge may also enable marketers to manipulate aspects of a product trial that are most influential on the set of trial responses that this study has shown to significantly affect brand evaluation for that product type. © 1999 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",doi,10.1002/(SICI)1520-6793(199901)16:1<35::AID-MAR3>3.0.CO;2-U,Scopus,Psychology and Marketing,Kempf D.S.,1999,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Auditory Experiences In Game Transfer Phenomena: An Empirical Self-Report Study,"This study investigated gamers' auditory experiences as after effects of playing. This was done by classifying, quantifying, and analysing 192 experiences from 155 gamers collected from online videogame forums. The gamers' experiences were classified as: (i) involuntary auditory imagery (e.g., hearing the music, sounds or voices from the game), (ii) inner speech (e.g., completing phrases in the mind), (iii) auditory misperceptions (e.g., confusing real life sounds with videogame sounds), and (iv) multisensorial auditory experiences (e.g., hearing music while involuntary moving the fingers). Gamers heard auditory cues from the game in their heads, in their ears, but also coming from external sources. Occasionally, the vividness of the sound evoked thoughts and emotions that resulted in behaviours and copying strategies. The psychosocial implications of the gamers' auditory experiences are discussed. This study contributes to the understanding of the effects of auditory features in videogames, and to the phenomenology of non-volitional auditory experiences. © 2015, IGI Global.

,"Autism, Serious Games And Robotics: Tangible Reality Or Abuse Of Language? [Autisme, Jeux Sérieux Et Robotique : Réalité Tangible Ou Abus De Langage ?]","The number of studies focusing on the use of information technology and robotics for individuals with autism has been rising steeply over the last 15 years. Here, we briefly summarize the hope, but also the issues, of 2 domains we consider the most exciting: (1) the computation of serious game aiming at training specific skills (emotion recognition, social interaction); (2) interaction with robotic platforms. We will detail two projects in which we worked as partners, JeMIME for serious games, and Michelangelo for human-robot interaction. We conclude that the potential benefit of the use of information technology and robotics for individuals with autism is enormous given what was achieved in less than 15 years. However, limitations are numerous and clinical validation still lacking. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS",doi,10.1016/j.amp.2017.03.013,Scopus,Annales Medico-Psychologiques,"Cohen D., Grossard C., Grynszpan O., Anzalone S., Boucenna S., Xavier J., Chetouani M., Chaby L.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Automatic Interpretation Of Affective Facial Expressions In The Context Of Interpersonal Interaction,"This paper proposes a method for interpretation of the emotions detected in facial expressions in the context of the events that cause them. The method was developed to analyze the video recordings of facial expressions depicted during a collaborative game played as a part of the Mars-500 experiment. In this experiment, six astronauts were isolated for 520 days in a space station to simulate a flight to Mars. Seven time-dependent components of facial expressions were extracted from the video recordings of the experiment. To interpret these dynamic components, we proposed a mathematical model of emotional events. Genetic programming was used to find the locations, types, and intensities of the emotional events as well as the way the recorded facial expressions represented reactions to them. By classification of different statistical properties of the data, we found that there are significant relations between the facial expressions of different crew members and a memory effect between the collective emotional states of the crew members. The model of emotional events was validated on previously unseen video recordings of the astronauts. We demonstrated that both genetic search and optimization of the parameters improve the accuracy of the proposed model. This method is a step toward automating the analysis of affective expressions in terms of the cognitive appraisal theory of emotion, which relies on the dependence of the expressed emotion on the causing event. © 2013 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/THMS.2015.2419259,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems,"Barakova E.I., Gorbunov R., Rauterberg M.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Automatic Speech Recognition- An Approach For Designing Inclusive Games,"Computer games are now a part of our modern culture. However, certain categories of people are excluded from this form of entertainment and social interaction because they are unable to use the interface of the games. The reason for this can be deficits in motor control, vision or hearing. By using automatic speech recognition systems (ASR), voice driven commands can be used to control the game, which can thus open up the possibility for people with motor system difficulty to be included in game communities. This paper aims at find a standard way of using voice commands in games which uses a speech recognition system in the backend, and that can be universally applied for designing inclusive games. Present speech recognition systems however, do not support emotions, attitudes, tones etc. This is a drawback because such expressions can be vital for gaming. Taking multiple types of existing genres of games into account and analyzing their voice command requirements, a general ASRS module is proposed which can work as a common platform for designing inclusive games. A fuzzy logic controller proposed then is to enhance the system. The standard voice driven module can be based on algorithm or fuzzy controller which can be used to design software plug-ins or can be included in microchip. It then can be integrated with the game engines; creating the possibility of voice driven universal access for controlling games. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",doi,10.1007/s11042-011-0918-7,Scopus,Multimedia Tools and Applications,Mustaquim M.M.,2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Autonomic Modulation In Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy During A Computer Task: A Prospective Control Trial,"Introduction: Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is characterized by progressive muscle weakness that can lead to disability. Owing to functional difficulties faced by individuals with DMD, the use of assistive technology is essential to provide or facilitate functional abilities. In DMD, cardiac autonomic dysfunction has been reported in addition to musculoskeletal impairment. Consequently, the objective was to investigate acute cardiac autonomic responses, by Heart Rate Variability (HRV), during computer tasks in subjects with DMD. Method: HRV was assessed by linear and nonlinear methods, using the heart rate monitor Polar RS800CX chest strap Electrocardiographic measuring device. Then, 45 subjects were included in the group with DMD and 45 in the healthy Typical Development (TD) control group. They were assessed for twenty minutes at rest sitting, and five minutes after undergoing a task on the computer. Results: Individuals with DMD had a statistically significant lower parasympathetic cardiac modulation at rest when compared to the control group, which further declined when undergoing the tasks on the computer. Conclusion: DMD patients presented decreased HRV and exhibited greater intensity of cardiac autonomic responses during computer tasks characterized by vagal withdrawal when compared to the healthy TD control subjects.",doi,10.1371/journal.pone.0169633,Scopus,PLoS ONE,"Alvarez M.P.B., Da Silva T.D., Favero F.M., Valenti V.E., Raimundo R.D., Vanderlei L.C.M., Garner D.M., De Mello Monteiro C.B.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Autonomous And Decentralized Optimization Of Large-Scale Heterogeneous Wireless Networks By Neural Network Dynamics,"We propose a neurodynamical approach to a large-scale optimization problem in Cognitive Wireless Clouds, in which a huge number of mobile terminals with multiple different air interfaces autonomously utilize the most appropriate infrastructure wireless networks, by sensing available wireless networks, selecting the most appropriate one, and reconfiguring themselves with seamless handover to the target networks. To deal with such a cognitive radio network, game theory has been applied in order to analyze the stability of the dynamical systems consisting of the mobile terminals' distributed behaviors, but it is not a tool for globally optimizing the state of the network. As a natural optimization dynamical system model suitable for large-scale complex systems, we introduce the neural network dynamics which converges to an optimal state since its property is to continually decrease its energy function. In this paper, we apply such neurodynamics to the optimization problem of radio access technology selection. We compose a neural network that solves the problem, and we show that it is possible to improve total average throughput simply by using distributed and autonomous neuron updates on the terminal side.

,Bacteria Hunt: Evaluating Multi-Paradigm Bci Interaction,"The multimodal, multi-paradigm brain-computer interfacing (BCI) game Bacteria Hunt was used to evaluate two aspects of BCI interaction in a gaming context. One goal was to examine the effect of feedback on the ability of the user to manipulate his mental state of relaxation. This was done by having one condition in which the subject played the game with real feedback, and another with sham feedback. The feedback did not seem to affect the game experience (such as sense of control and tension) or the objective indicators of relaxation, alpha activity and heart rate. The results are discussed with regard to clinical neurofeedback studies. The second goal was to look into possible interactions between the two BCI paradigms used in the game: steady-state visually-evoked potentials (SSVEP) as an indicator of concentration, and alpha activity as a measure of relaxation. SSVEP stimulation activates the cortex and can thus block the alpha rhythm. Despite this effect, subjects were able to keep their alpha power up, in compliance with the instructed relaxation task. In addition to the main goals, a new SSVEP detection algorithm was developed and evaluated. © 2010 The Author(s).",doi,10.1007/s12193-010-0046-0,Scopus,Journal on Multimodal User Interfaces,"Mühl C., Gürkök H., Plass-Oude Bos D., Thurlings M.E., Scherffig L., Duvinage M., Elbakyan A.A., Kang S., Poel M., Heylen D.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Ball Positioning In Robotic Billiards: A Nonprehensile Manipulation-Based Solution,"The last two decades have seen a number of developments in creating robots to play billiards. The designed robotic systems have successfully incorporated the kinematics required and have had appropriate machine vision elements for a decent gameplay. Independently, computer scientists have also developed the artificial intelligence programs needed for the strategy to play billiards. Despite these developments, the accurate ball manipulation aspect of the game, needed for good performance, has not been addressed enough; two important parameters are the potting accuracy and advantageous cue ball positioning for next shot. In this regard, robotic ball manipulation by predicting the ball trajectories under the action of various dynamic phenomena, such as ball spin, impacts and friction, is the key consideration of this research. By establishing a connection to the methods used in nonprehensile robotic manipulation, a forward model is developed for the rolling, sliding, and two distinct types of frictional impacts of billiards balls are developed. High-speed camera-based tracking is performed to determine the physical parameters required for the developed dynamic models. To solve the inverse manipulation problem, i.e., the decision on shot parameters, for accurate ball positioning, an optimization based solution is proposed. A simplistic ball manipulator is designed and used to test the theoretical developments. Experimental results show that a 90% potting accuracy and a 100-200 mm post-shot cue ball positioning accuracy has been achieved by the autonomous system within a table area of 6 × 5 ft2. © 1996-2012 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TMECH.2015.2461547,Scopus,IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics,"Mathavan S., Jackson M.R., Parkin R.M.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Bci Promises In Emotional Involvement In Music And Games,"The reliability of commercial non-invasive BCI (brain computer Interface) devices and the lower cost of these EEG-based systems, as well as the equipment's portability, determined the increasing interest in their application in different research fields. The latter feature makes BCI devices particularly suited for entertainment applications, especially given the possibility to detect the mental state of the users. The relationship between emotions and entertainment is obvious, as is the influence ofmusic in human emotional states. While BCI devices represent a challenge in gaming motion control, they have been successfully applied in music production [Dan et al. 2009] and composition [Hamadicharef et al. 2010]. In our previous work [Conscious and unconscious music from the brain in press] we focused on conscious production of music notes with the aim of developing a prototype for applications in entertainment.

,Behavioral And Neural Reactions To Emotions Of Others In The Distribution Of Resources,"This study investigated the neural mechanisms involved in the interpersonal effects of emotions-i.e., how people are influenced by other people's emotions. Participants were allocators in a version of the dictator game and made a choice between two offers after receiving written emotional expressions of the recipients. The results showed that participants more often made a self-serving offer when dealing with an angry recipient than when dealing with a happy or disappointed recipient. Compared to disappointment, expressions of anger increased activation in regions associated with self-referential thinking (anterior medial prefrontal cortex, aMPFC) and (emotional) conflict (anterior cingulate cortex). We found increased activation in temporoparietal junction for receiving happy reactions in comparison with receiving angry or disappointed reactions. This study thus emphasizes that distinct emotions have distinct effects on people in terms of behavior and underlying neurological mechanisms. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",doi,10.1080/17470919.2012.735621,Scopus,Social Neuroscience,"Lelieveld G.-J., van Dijk E., Güroǧlu B., van Beest I., van Kleef G.A., Rombouts S.A.R.B., Crone E.A.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas

,Between Freedom And Commitment: The Postmodern Family Discovered. A Sociological Study Of Typologies Off Amily And Leisure Domains In The Netherlands [Entre Iibertié Et Engagement: À La Decouverte De La Famille Post-Modeme. Étude Sociologique Des Typologies Des Domaines De La Famille Et Du Loisir En Hollande] [Entre Libertaé Y Compromiso: A La Búsqueda De Ia Familia Posmoderna. Estudio Sociológico De Las Tipologías Sobre Los Dominios De Ia Familia Y Del Ocio En Holanda],"The family in the Netherlands is once again on the political agenda. Newspapers and television announce discussions between politicians and policymakers. Scientists however, free from the political tide, are researching families in an attempt to discover the true developments. In this paper, an account is given of research into the family, upbringing and leisure. The study was carried out for the third time in the south of the Netherlands, in the towns of Arkel and Kedichem. In 1960, the research involved the modem Western family, while in 1972 the plastic family was registered. The third study had the task of getting empirical evidence to support the new family type. The first two studies were virtually identical in set-up, whereas the third study was very different because the questions asked before proved impossible to duplicate. Moreover, the third study consisted of three main themes: general family aspects, family and upbringing, and family and leisure. The content of the paper has mainly to do with the first and third themes. Structured interviews were conducted with 331 mothers who had at least one child aged between 0 and 18. The study illustrated the existence of three family types in rural areas in the Netherlands- the modem Western (contemporary: traditional), the transitional, and the postmodem family with its subtle leaning toward the value of leisure in the family. The general family typology demonstrates that in rural areas in the Netherlands in the late eighties/early nineties, 21% of the families were characterised as modem Western (traditional), 64% as transitional, and 15% as postrnodem. Viewed from the family leisure typology angle, these percentages show up as 54%, 34% and 12%: the family leisure typology scores are more conservative than those of the general family typology. The themes under the general family sociological denominator deal with opinions on: sex-specific task division, say in the family; independence in the marriage relation; the institution of marriage; and motherhood. Under the theme family and leisure what was sought were opinions about: task division in leisure time, definition of leisure time, togetherness in leisure time, freedom given to the partner, gender-specific upbringing during leisure time, the importance of television and games, and autonomy of the children in their free time.

,Beyond The Shooter Game: Examining Presence And Hostile Outcomes Among Male Game Players.,"Investigating male game players, this study explores how game interface (virtual reality [VR] and standard console), game content (fighting, shooting, and driving), and game context (human and computer competition) influence levels of presence and hostile expectation bias—the expectation others will think, feel, speak, and act aggressively during social conflict. In addition to game interface and game content influencing hostile expectations, significant interactions were detected for hostile expectations. Presence, although not as predicted, also significantly differed across game interface and game content. Through the development and testing of each gaming experience, this study demonstrates that simply testing violent and nonviolent game situations underestimates the complexity of contemporary video-game play.",doi,10.1177/0093650206293249,anderson2010,Communication Research,"Eastin, M.

,Blood Pressure Reactivity To Psychological Stress Predicts Hypertension In The Cardia Study,"Background - A longstanding but controversial hypothesis is that individuals who exhibit frequent, large increases in blood pressure (BP) during psychological stress are at risk for developing essential hypertension. We tested whether BP changes during psychological stress predict incident hypertension in young adults. Methods and Results - We used survival analysis to predict hypertensive status during 13 years of follow-up in a sample of >4100 normotensive black and white men and women (age at entry, 18 to 30 years) enrolled in the CARDIA study. BP responses to 3 psychological challenges - cold pressor, star tracing, and video game tasks - were measured. Hypertensive status was defined as use of antihypertensive medication or measured BP ≥140/90 mm Hg. After adjustment for race, gender, covariates (education, body mass index, age, and resting pressure), and their significant interactions, the larger the BP responses were to each of the 3 tasks, the earlier hypertension occurred (P<0.0001 to <0.01). The systolic BP effect for the cold pressor task was apparent for women and for whites in race- and gender-specific models, whereas the diastolic BP effect for the video game was apparent for men. Conclusions - Young adults who show a large BP response to psychological stress may be at risk for hypertension as they approach midlife.",doi,10.1161/01.CIR.0000133415.37578.E4,Scopus,Circulation,"Matthews K.A., Katholi C.R., McCreath H., Whooley M.A., Williams D.R., Zhu S., Markovitz J.H.",2004,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,"Brain Training For Silver Gamers: Effects Of Age And Game Form On Effectiveness, Efficiency, Self-Assessment, And Gameplay Experience","In recent years, an aging demographic majority in the Western world has come to the attention of the game industry. The recently released ""brain-training"" games target this population, and research investigating gameplay experience of the elderly using this game form is lacking. This study employs a 2× 2 mixed factorial design (age group: young and old× game form: paper and Nintendo DS) to investigate effects of age and game form on usability, self-assessment, and gameplay experience in a supervised field study. Effectiveness was evaluated in task completion time, efficiency as error rate, together with self-assessment measures (arousal, pleasure, dominance) and game experience (challenge, flow, competence, tension, positive and negative affect). Results indicate players, regardless of age, are more effective and efficient using pen-and-paper than using a Nintendo DS console. However, the game is more arousing and induces a heightened sense of flow in digital form for gamers of all ages. Logic problem-solving challenges within digital games may be associated with positive feelings for the elderly but with negative feelings for the young. Thus, digital logic-training games may provide positive gameplay experience for an aging Western civilization. © 2009, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",doi,10.1089/cpb.2009.0013,Scopus,Cyberpsychology and Behavior,"Nacke L.E., Nacke A., Lindley C.A.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Bringing Tabletop Technology To All: Evaluating A Tangible Farm Game With Kindergarten And Special Needs Children,"The tangible interaction approach has in recent years become a promising alternative to multitouch tabletops for very young children. Children learning with tangible user interfaces can benefit from the same pedagogical values as learning with materials in physical play. The NIKVision tabletop and games have been designed to provide leisure and fun while reinforcing physical manipulation and co-located gaming for young children (3- to 6-year-olds). Interaction is provided in NIKVision by the handling of conventional toys and computer augmentation on a table surface. First of all, the paper sets out the results of a summative evaluation carried out in nurseries and schools summarising the performance of the tabletop in terms of usability, user experience and physical and colocated gaming. Secondly, the paper presents an evaluation carried out in a special education school with children with cognitive disabilities, in an attempt to widen the range of possible beneficiaries of tangible interfaces. The challenge in this case is to ensure children's comprehension of the game and to adequately combine feedback on the application with teacher interventions. In fact, the initial results reinforce the idea of not trying to substitute but rather to assist teachers and emphasise the possibilities offered by the tabletop as a tool to promote student autonomy. © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2012.",doi,10.1007/s00779-012-0522-5,Scopus,Personal and Ubiquitous Computing,"Marco J., Cerezo E., Baldassarri S.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Building Temperature Control Based On Population Dynamics,"Temperature control in buildings is a dynamic resource allocation problem, which can be approached using nonlinear methods based on population dynamics (i.e., replicator dynamics). A mathematical model of the proposed control technique is shown, including a stability analysis using passivity concepts for an interconnection of a linear multivariable plant driven by a nonlinear control system. In order to illustrate our control strategy, some simulations are performed, and we compare our proposed technique with other control strategies in a model with a fixed structure. Finally, experimental results are shown in order to observe the performance of some of these strategies in a multizone temperature testbed. © 2013 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TCST.2013.2252175,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology,"Obando G., Pantoja A., Quijano N.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Can Personality Traits Predict Pathological Responses To Audiovisual Stimulation?,"The ""Pockemon shock"" is the most famous accident in the history of the broadcasting industry in Japan. Based on the experiences of this unfortunate accident from famous animation program ""Pocket Monster"", this study focused on the psychology and psychosomatics of the patients. A head-mounted display was used as the three-dimensional image presentation device and ""Descent"", a free software shooting game, was used as the software. Ten healthy adult male volunteers were used in this experiment after obtaining their informed consent. The oxygen metabolic change in the anterior lobe of the brain was measured by near infrared spectroscopy and recorded on an electrocardiogram. The mental scaling tendency of the object was analyzed using the type A behavior pattern and the hostility scaling. The Cook and Medley hostility (HO) scale from the Minnesota multiphasic personality inventory (MMPI) was also used in this experiment. From this scaling methodology, the paranoid scale, cynicism scale, lie scale, social support quality and social support quantity were calculated. All measured time series data were kept in the normal range, and no fatal arrhythmia or epilepsy were observed during experiments. In some cases, the brain oxygen metabolism may completely differ for the objects of Type A and Type B behavior patterns. On the whole, correlation did not become significant in type A scaling and hostility scaling. In a comparison of the percent changes of the HF in HRV with lie scaling, significant negative correlation was observed. The social support quantity was calculated from Cook and Medley, and significant negative correlations were observed with percent changes of LF/HF in HRV. The lie scale and social support quantity are opposite scaling. The sympathetic nervous system and parasympathetic nervous system have an opposite function also. Therefore, our results showed an interesting phenomenon, when considering the relationship between the autonomic function and the pathophysiological reaction to the audiovisual stimulations. As for the photo sensitive epilepsy, it was reported to be only 5-10% for all patients. Therefore, 90% or more of the cause could not be determined in patients who started a morbid response. The results in this study suggest that the autonomic function was connected to the mental tendency of the objects. By examining such directivity, it is expected that subjects, which show morbid reaction to an audiovisual stimulation, can be screened beforehand. © 2003 Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.

,"Carbohydrate Gel Ingestion Significantly Improves The Intermittent Endurance Capacity, But Not Sprint Performance, Of Adolescent Team Games Players During A Simulated Team Games Protocol","The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of ingesting a carbohydrate (CHO) gel on the intermittent endurance capacity and sprint performance of adolescent team games players. Eleven participants [mean age 13.5 ± 0.7 years, height 1.72 ± 0.08 m, body mass (BM) 62.1 ± 9.4 kg] performed two trials separated by 3-7 days. In each trial, they completed four 15 min periods of part A of the Loughborough Intermittent Shuttle Test (LIST), followed by an intermittent run to exhaustion (part B). In the 5 min pre-exercise, participants consumed 0.818 mL kg -1 BM of a CHO or a non-CHO placebo gel, and a further 0.327 mL kg -1 BM every 15 min during part A of the LIST (38.0 ± 5.5 g CHO h -1 in the CHO trial). Intermittent endurance capacity was increased by 21.1% during part B when the CHO gel was ingested (4.6 ± 2.0 vs. 3.8 ± 2.4 min, P &lt; 0.05, r = 0.67), with distance covered in part B significantly greater in the CHO trial (787 ± 319 vs. 669 ± 424 m, P &lt; 0.05, r = 0.57). Gel ingestion did not significantly influence mean 15 m sprint time (P = 0.34), peak sprint time (P = 0.81), or heart rate (P = 0.66).

,Cardiovascular Changes In Video-Game Players. Cause For Concern?,"Video games are one of the most popular recreational activities among Americans of all ages, especially teenaged boys and young men. Studies of the health hazards of video-game playing have linked seizures, psychologic disturbances, and other health problems with the games. The study reported here measured changes in blood pessure and heart rate that occurred in 23 young men when they played a video game. The mean systolic blood pressure for the entire group was considerably higher during play than before or after and was significantly higher in novice players than in more skilled players. Heart rate was also significantly higher during play. In view of these results, other cardiovascular changes might be expected to occur during video-game playing.

,Casual Games With A Pervasive Twist,"In this paper we present proposals for including real world elements in games taking into account the profile of casual players. Several real world elements can be utilized so that the fictional game world merges with reality. We focused on sound, video, physiological data, accelerometer data, weather and the player's location. From our experience developing and testing casual games, resulted a set of guidelines that address technological requirements on the player side. These guidelines may be of use for other researchers and developers in order to better adapt games to their audience. By resorting to real world elements, the screen no longer is the only focus of the player's attention because reality also influences the outcome of the game. Results are presented about how the insertion of real world elements affected the role of the screen as the primary focus of the player's attention. Positive results, in what regards defeating the screen, were obtained, mainly, with sound, the electrodermal activity and the accelerometer for these elements were used in such a way that the player's daily activities became part of the game. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",doi,10.1016/j.entcom.2014.03.003,Scopus,Entertainment Computing,"Reis S., Correia N.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Characteristics Of The Early Flight Phase In The Olympic Ski Jumping Competition,"Early flight phase (approximately 40 m) of the athletes participating in the final round of the individual large hill ski jumping competition in Salt Lake City Olympics was filmed with two high-speed pan & tilt video cameras. The results showed that jumpers' steady flight position was almost completed within 0.5 s. The most significant correlation with the length of the jump was found in the angle between the skis and body (r=.714, p≤.001 at 1.1 s after the take-off). This particular phase seemed to be important because the ski angle of attack was also related to the jumping distance at the same phase. Although the more upright ski position relative to flight path resulted in longer jumping distance, the winner of the competition had significantly lower ski position as compared to the other good jumpers. This may be due to the high altitude (>2000 m) of the ski jumping stadium in this competition. Because of the low air density, the aerodynamic forces were also low and this probably caused less skilful jumpers to lean too much forward at this phase. Maintenance of speed seemed to be emphasized in this particular competition. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

,"Characterizing Diabetes, Diet, Exercise, And Obesity Comments On Twitter","Social media provide a platform for users to express their opinions and share information. Understanding public health opinions on social media, such as Twitter, offers a unique approach to characterizing common health issues such as diabetes, diet, exercise, and obesity (DDEO); however, collecting and analyzing a large scale conversational public health data set is a challenging research task. The goal of this research is to analyze the characteristics of the general public's opinions in regard to diabetes, diet, exercise and obesity (DDEO) as expressed on Twitter. A multi-component semantic and linguistic framework was developed to collect Twitter data, discover topics of interest about DDEO, and analyze the topics. From the extracted 4.5 million tweets, 8% of tweets discussed diabetes, 23.7% diet, 16.6% exercise, and 51.7% obesity. The strongest correlation among the topics was determined between exercise and obesity (p <.0002). Other notable correlations were: diabetes and obesity (p <.0005), and diet and obesity (p <.001). DDEO terms were also identified as subtopics of each of the DDEO topics. The frequent subtopics discussed along with “Diabetes”, excluding the DDEO terms themselves, were blood pressure, heart attack, yoga, and Alzheimer. The non-DDEO subtopics for “Diet” included vegetarian, pregnancy, celebrities, weight loss, religious, and mental health, while subtopics for “Exercise” included computer games, brain, fitness, and daily plan. Non-DDEO subtopics for “Obesity” included Alzheimer, cancer, and children. With 2.67 billion social media users in 2016, publicly available data such as Twitter posts can be utilized to support clinical providers, public health experts, and social scientists in better understanding common public opinions in regard to diabetes, diet, exercise, and obesity. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",doi,10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2017.08.002,Scopus,International Journal of Information Management,"Karami A., Dahl A.A., Turner-McGrievy G., Kharrazi H., Shaw G., Jr.",2018,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Charlie: An Adaptive Robot Design With Hand And Face Tracking For Use In Autism Therapy,"Basic turn-taking and imitation skills are imperative for effective communication and social interaction (Nehaniv in Imitation and Social Learning in Robots, Springer, New York, 2007). Recently, research has demonstrated that interactive games using turn-taking and imitation have yielded positive results with autistic children who have impaired communication or social skills (Barakova and Brok in Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Entertainment Computing, pp. 115-126, 2010). This paper describes a robot that plays interactive imitation games using hand and face tracking. The robot is equipped with a head and two arms, each with two degrees of freedom, and a camera. We trained a human hands detector and subsequently, used this detector along with a standard face tracker to create two autonomous interactive games: single-player (""Imitate Me, Imitate You"") and two-player (""Pass the Pose"".) Additionally, we implemented a third setting in which the robot is teleoperated by remote control. In ""Imitate Me, Imitate You"", the robot has both passive and active game modes. In the passive mode, the robot waits for the child to initiate an interaction by raising one or both hands. In the second game mode, the robot initiates interactions. The ""Pass the Pose"" game engages two children in cooperative play by enlisting the robot as a mediator between two children alternately initiating and imitating poses. These games are designed to increase attention, promote turn-taking skills and encourage child-led verbal and nonverbal communication through simple imitative play. This research makes two specific contributions: (1) We present a low-cost robot design which measures and adapts to a child's actions during interactive games and, (2) we train, test and make freely available, a new hand detector, based on Haar-like features, which is usable in various kinds of human-robot interactions. We present proof-of-concept experiments with a group of typically developing children. © Springer Science & Business Media BV 2011.",doi,10.1007/s12369-011-0110-2,Scopus,International Journal of Social Robotics,"Boccanfuso L., O'Kane J.M.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Children's Cardiovascular Reactivity: Stability Of Racial Differences And Relation To Subsequent Blood Pressure Over A One‐Year Period,"After measuring blood pressure and heart rate at rest and during a video game procedure in 477 children enrolled in 3rd grade, 434 (91%) children had these measurements repeated a year later in 4th grade. Black children demonstrated greater blood pressure and heart rate reactivity than White children in both years, and an increase in heart rate reactivity from 3rd to 4th grade. Gender effects were inconsistent. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures during the video game were more highly correlated from year‐to‐year than were the resting measures. Regression analysis indicated that systolic reactivity was significantly related to subsequent systolic pressure at rest, particularly among Black girls. Diastolic reactivity was associated with subsequent resting diastolic pressure only among White children. Associations between reactivity and future blood pressure were independent of initial resting blood pressure. This study suggests that cardiovascular reactivity to psychological stress may be one important factor in future level of blood pressure and that the increased heart rate reactivity of Black children may be associated with the prevalence of hypertension among Black adults.

,Children's Exposure To Violent Video Games And Desensitization To Violence,"Desensitization to violence is cited frequently as being an outcome of exposure to media violence and a condition that contributes to increased aggression. This article initiates the development of a conceptual model for describing possible relationships among violent video games, brain function, and desensitization by using empathy and attitudes toward violence as proxy measures of desensitization. More work is needed to understand how specific game content may affect brain activity, how brain development may be affected by heavy play at young ages, and how personality and lifestyle variables may moderate game influence. Given the current state of knowledge, recommendations are made for clinicians to help parents monitor and limit exposure to violent video games and encourage critical thinking about media violence. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

,Children And Electronic Games: A Comparison Of Parents’ And Children’s Perceptions Of Children’s Habits And Preferences In A United States Sample.,"Despite the popularity of violent electronic games, anecdotal evidence suggests that many parents lack even basic information about children's game-playing habits. The goal of the present study was to examine parental knowledge of children's electronic game-playing habits by assessing the congruence between children's and parents' perceptions of child's playing time, parental supervision, game preference, and reaction to actual game-playing. 35 children in Grades 3 to 5 and one parent of each child completed a background questionnaire and played either a violent or nonviolent electronic game. In paired comparisons, parents reported significantly higher estimates of supervision time than children. Most parents either named an incorrect game or were not able to guess their child's favorite game. In 70% of these incorrect matches, children described their favorite game as violent. Parents may underestimate their child's exposure to violence in electronic games. After playing the same electronic game as part of the study, parents reported significantly higher frustration than children. Higher frustration with game-playing could contribute to deficits in parental knowledge of children's playing habits.",doi,10.2466/pr0.1999.85.3.883,anderson2010,Psychological Reports,"Funk, J., Hagan, J., Schimming, J.",1999,NA,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,"Children’s And Adults' Salivary Cortisol Responses To An Identical Psychosocial Laboratory Stressor. Psychoneuroendocrinology, 35(2), 241–8.","Many studies have investigated hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis responses to psychosocial stress in adults. In children, much less is known about HPA axis reactivity, and a sizable number of studies has not detected a significant cortisol response. Moreover, there is a lack of studies comparing adults' and children's responses to identical stressors. The aim of the present study was to modify an existing laboratory stressor to serve as a potent stressor in children and to allow for direct comparison between children's and adults' stress responses. Thirty children, ages 9-12 (14 female), and 31 young adults, ages 18-25 (17 female), were exposed to the modified protocol (TSST-M). A significant increase in salivary cortisol was observed in response to the TSST-M, F(2.5,125.4)=19.65, p<.001, eta(2)=.28, and overall, no differences were found between children's and adults' responses, F(2.5,125.4)=.31, n.s. Children and adults also showed similar changes in negative and positive affect, both F<1.18, n.s. and reported a similar amount of distress during the TSST-M, F(1,57)=.97, n.s. Children did, however, exhibit a significantly greater number of behaviors indicative of distress, F(1,50)=6.59, p=.01, eta(2)=.12. This study provides preliminary evidence that the TSST-M is a useful laboratory procedure to induce significant cortisol responses in children.

,Chronic Violent Video Game Exposure And Desensitization To Violence: Behavioral And Event-Related Brain Potential Data.,"Numerous studies have shown that exposure to media violence increases aggression, though the mechanisms of this effect have remained elusive. One theory posits that repeated exposure to media violence desensitizes viewers to real world violence, increasing aggression by blunting aversive reactions to violence and removing normal inhibitions against aggression. Theoretically, violence desensitization should be reflected in the amplitude of the P300 component of the event-related brain potential (ERP), which has been associated with activation of the aversive motivational system. In the current study, violent images elicited reduced P300 amplitudes among violent, as compared to nonviolent video game players. Additionally, this reduced brain response predicted increased aggressive behavior in a later task. Moreover, these effects held after controlling for individual differences in trait aggressiveness. These data are the first to link media violence exposure and aggressive behavior to brain processes hypothetically associated with desensitization.",doi,10.1016/j.jesp.2005.08.006,anderson2010,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,"Bartholow, B.

,Coalition Formation For Bearings-Only Localization In Sensor Networks-A Cooperative Game Approach,"In this paper, formation of optimal coalitions of nodes is investigated for data acquisition in bearings-only target localization such that the average sleep time allocated to the nodes is maximized. Targets are required to be localized with a prespecified accuracy where the localization accuracy metric is defined to be the determinant of the Bayesian Fisher information matrix (B-FIM). We utilize cooperative game theory as a tool to devise a distributed dynamic coalition formation algorithm in which nodes autonomously decide which coalition to join while maximizing their feasible sleep times. Nodes in the sleep mode do not record any measurements, hence, save energy in both sensing and transmitting the sensed data. It is proved that if each node operates according to this algorithm, the average sleep time for the entire network converges to its maximum feasible value. In numerical examples, we illustrate the tradeoff between localization accuracy and the average sleep time allocated to the nodes and demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed scheme via Monte Carlo simulations. © 2010 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TSP.2010.2049201,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing,"Gharehshiran O.N., Krishnamurthy V.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Coercion Builds Cooperation In Dynamic And Heterogeneous P2p Live Streaming Networks,"Sustaining reasonable performance in a peer-to-peer (P2P) network is contingent upon cooperation among peers. As autonomous agents, peers cooperate only when they are incentivized to do so. Typically, incentives are provided through bilateral exchange of useful data, in a tit-for-tat manner. Unfortunately, good for file sharing and video-on-demand systems as they are, such incentive schemes are ineffective in live streaming systems due mainly to the lack of sufficient opportunity to allow such reciprocity to happen, as recently demonstrated in a pioneering quantitative study. The key insight is that with stringent time constraint, good system performance can only be sustained by judicious peer selection. Despite that some pioneering efforts are done in peer selection, it is as yet a difficult challenge to tackle the inherent non-cooperation of peers in a dynamic and bandwidth-diverse network. In this paper, we meet this challenge by first presenting a novel hierarchical game model, covering strategic interactions among peers, trackers, and the content provider. Based on the analytical insights derived from the repeated game model, we propose a Striker strategy to coerce peers to cooperate, leading to significantly enhanced system performance, as demonstrated by our analytical and simulation results. Most importantly, our proposed incentive schemes are highly practicable in a real-life P2P network. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

,Cognitive-Bias Toward Gaming-Related Words And Disinhibition In World Of Warcraft Gamers,"This study investigated cognitive biases toward gaming-related words and differences in cognitive performance among twelve World of Warcraft players (WWP) and thirty non-players (NP). We measured response to valenced common English and WoW jargon words using a computer-based go/no-go task. Sometimes positive valence words were the targets for the 'go' response, with negative-valence words as the distracters, sometimes the reverse. Target discrimination (d′) and response disinhibition (C) were calculated using a signal detection analysis. Based on questionnaire responses, there were no differences between groups in depression, anxiety, smoking or drinking, but WWP reported significantly more screen and gaming time (17.31 h/week versus 4.12 among NP). WWP had faster reaction time (RT) and better discrimination of targets from distracters (high d′) but also showed higher disinhibition (low C). WWP also showed cognitive-bias toward game-related words in the form of higher d′ for WoW jargon than common English and more disinhibition to positive-valence WoW jargon. Similar to past studies which have found alcoholics to have cognitive biases toward alcohol-related words, WWP who play frequently showed cognitive biases toward words related to the World of Warcraft game. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

,"Cognitive Appraisals And Emotions Predict Cortisol And Immune Responses: A Meta-Analysis Of Acute Laboratory Social Stressors And Emotion Inductions. Psychological Bulletin, 135(6), 823–53.","Models of stress and health suggest that emotions mediate the effects of stress on health; yet meta-analytic reviews have not confirmed these relationships. Categorizations of emotions along broad dimensions such as valence (e.g., positive and negative affect) may obscure important information about the effects of specific emotions on physiology. Within the context of the integrated specificity model, we present a novel theoretical framework that posits that specific emotional responses associated with specific types of environmental demands influence cortisol and immune outcomes in a manner that would have likely promoted the survival of our ancestors. We analyzed experiments from 66 journal articles that directly manipulated social stress or emotions and measured subsequent cortisol or immune responses. Judges rated experiments for the extent to which participants would experience theoretically relevant cognition and affect clustered around five categories: (a) cognitive appraisals, (b) basic emotions, (c) rumination and worry, (d) social threat, and (e) global mood states. As expected, global mood states were unassociated with the effect sizes, whereas exemplars from the other categories were generally associated with effect sizes in the expected manner.

,Colombian Children With Overweight And Obesity Need Additional Motivational Support At School To Perform Health-Enhancing Physical Activity,"Aims: The aim of this study is to investigate associations of screen-time and physical activity (PA) with self-efficacy for PA, intrinsic motivation to PA and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in Colombian schoolchildren from socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods, and to compare these variables among children with normal-weight (NW), overweight (OW) and obesity (OB). Methods: In 678 schoolchildren (age 10-14 years) screen-time (TV, video games, computer) and number of days being physically active ≥ 60 minutes were self-reported. Multi-item scales were used to assess self-efficacy to PA and intrinsic motivation to PA. The KIDSCREEN-27 was used to assess HRQoL. Results: Screen-time was associated with HRQoL in the school/learning environment dimension. Number of days being physically active was associated with self-efficacy for PA, intrinsic motivation for PA and with HRQoL concerning physical well-being, autonomy/parent relation and social support/peers. Group differences were found for days being physically active (OW = 2.8 and OB = 2.7 vs. NW = 3.3) but not for screen-time (NW = 5.0, OW = 4.7 and OB = 5.7 hrs d-1). OW and OB scored lower on intrinsic motivation to PA than NW (OW = 19.2 and OB = 17.9 versus NW = 20.1). All 3 groups differed in physical well-being scores (NW = 50.3, OW = 48.1, OB = 40.6, P < .001). Conclusions: Schoolchildren with overweight and obesity from socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods need additional motivational support to perform health-enhancing PA to experience higher physical well-being. © 2015 Human Kinetics, Inc.",doi,10.1123/jpah.2014-0024,Scopus,Journal of Physical Activity and Health,"Olaya-Contreras P., Bastidas M., Arvidsson D.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Colour Characterization Of Handheld Game Console Displays,"During recent years, research on colour vision has used traditional visual colorimeters, cathode ray tubes (CRT), and personal-computer controlled LCD-TFT screens to generate chromatic stimuli. We here explore the possibilities offered by a particular family of electronic devices whose use has lately been expanding rapidly, and which have one or more TFT screens and all the hardware needed for portable and autonomous use: handheld game consoles. We considered the different consoles available on the market, and as a result conducted an initial comparative study of two models - Sony PSP and Nintendo DS. As a result of this study, we checked the potential of using the Nintendo DS console, of which more than 100 million units have been sold worldwide. The results of our tests clearly indicated that it can be used as a tool in colour vision and physiological optics at the same technical level as CRT or TFT screens. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

,Combined Influence Of Media Use On Subjective Health In Elementary School Children In Japan: A Population-Based Study,"Background: In recent years in Japan, electronic games, home computers, and the internet have assumed an important place in peoples lives, even for elementary school children. Subjective health complaints have also become a problem among children. In the present study, we investigated the relationship between media use and health status in elementary school children in Japan. Methods: A cross-sectional school-based population survey was conducted in 2009 with a sample of fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-grade children (age range: 1012 years old) in elementary schools in Japan (n = 3,464). Self-reported health, lifestyle habits, and time spent using media were assessed. Results: The use of games, television, and personal computers was significantly associated with lifestyle (p<0.05) and subjective health (p<0.05). In addition, the use of games, the use of television, and the use of personal computers were mutually associated. The greater the number of media used for more than 1 hour was, the higher the odds ratio of the association of media use with unhealthy lifestyle and subjective health complaints was. The plural use of these media had stronger associations with unhealthy lifestyle and subjective health complaints. Conclusions: Game, television, and personal-computer use were mutually associated, and the plural use of these media had stronger associations with unhealthy lifestyle and subjective health complaints. Excessive use of media might be a risk for unhealthy lifestyle and subjective health complaints. © 2012 Nakamura et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",doi,10.1186/1471-2458-12-432,Scopus,BMC Public Health,"Nakamura H., Ohara K., Kouda K., Fujita Y., Mase T., Miyawaki C., Okita Y., Ishikawa T.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Combining Experimental Observations And Modelling In Investigating Feedback And Emotions In Repeated Selection Tasks,"People seem to learn tasks even without formal training. This can be modelled as the outcome of a feedback system that accumulates experience. In this paper we investigate such a feedback system, following an iterative research approach. A feedback loop is specified that is detailed using contemporary ideas on human behaviour. The resulting model is investigated in an empirical study. Finally, we consider a computational mechanism to explain the results. This approach is aimed at understanding how a feedback mechanism might work rather than at observing its outcomes. In this paper, we study the approach through adjustments in card selections in a game consisting of repeated card choices. Playing this game, participants do not know what rules determine gains and losses. Therefore there is some tension between exploring the options and achieving immediate profit. To decide in such situations it is argued that often evaluations below the level of conscious awareness, such as affect, play an important role. The results support the hypothesis that participants would draw better cards as the game progressed. There is some evidence that emotions are involved, since the hypothesis that profit and emotions are correlated is confirmed. Further evidence that formal logic is not sufficient follows from the observed effects of music on card selections. In the second part of the paper the aim is to understand the results from a computational point of view. Four possible ways of integrating feedback into a decision criterion are compared. Using one of these mechanisms, a computational model is investigated that might describe the role of music in card selection. Although there are limitations to both the empirical and computational findings, the chosen approach indicates that computational modelling of experiential appraisal, at a preconscious level, and the effect of external factors, such as music, is in principle feasible, and can lead to a research agenda aimed at understanding such phenomena. © Springer 2005.",doi,10.1007/s11257-005-1868-4,Scopus,User Modelling and User-Adapted Interaction,"Fischer A.R.H., Blommaert F.J.J., Midden C.J.H.",2005,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Comparing The Effects Of Real Versus Simulated Violence On Dream Imagery,"Participants in the current study were 75 males, including 25 Canadian soldiers, 25 heavy gamers who play military based video games such as ""Call of Duty,"" and a control group comprised of 25 males. One dream per participant was analyzed using Hall and Van de Castle content analysis guidelines, including aggression, threat, and previously established scales for intensity of aggression and emotion. The dreams of soldiers had a higher frequency of both aggression and threat, and were also more intense in aggression and emotion than both the heavy gamers and the controls. These findings suggest that exposure to real life violence and threat (as well as the emotional significance of the experience) is more frequently incorporated into dream imagery than simulated or virtual threat. Limitations and directions for future studies are discussed. © Copyright 2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2014.",doi,10.1089/cyber.2013.0494,Scopus,"Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking","Dale A., Murkar A., Miller N., Black J.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Comparison Of Acute Exercise Responses Between Conventional Video Gaming And Isometric Resistance Exergaming,"Exergaming is a relatively new type of entertainment that couples physical activity and video gaming. To date, research that has focused on the physiologic responses to exergaming has been focused exclusively on aerobic-type activities. The purpose of this project was to describe the acute exercise responses (i.e., oxygen uptake [V̇O2], heart rate, and rate of perceived exertion [RPE]) to exergaming using full-body isometric muscle resistance and to determine whether these responses are different during singleversus opponent-based play. Male subjects (n = 32) were randomly and equally divided into either an experimental (EXP) or control (CON) group. Acute exercise responses (V̇O2, heart rate, and RPE) were measured in all subjects during both soloand opponent-based video game play. Subjects in the EXP group played using a controller that relied on full-body isometric muscle resistance to manipulate the on-screen character, whereas CON subjects used a conventional handheld controller. During solo play, the EXP group exhibited significantly higher values for V̇O2 (9.60 ±0.50 mL/kg/min) and energy expenditure (3.50 ± 0.14 kcal/min) than the CON group (V̇O2 5.05 ± 0.16 mL/kg/min; energy expenditure 1.92 ± 0.07 kcal/min). These changes occurred with no significant differences in RPE or heart rate between the groups. These results suggest that whole-body isometric exergaming results in greater energy expenditure than conventional video gaming, with no increase in perceived exertion during play. This could have important implications regarding long-term energy expenditure in gamers. © 2010 National Strength and Conditioning Association.",doi,10.1519/JSC.0b013e3181bab4a8,Scopus,Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research,"Bonetti A.J., Drury D.G., Danoff J.V., Miller T.A.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Computational Modeling Of Players' Emotional Response Patterns To The Story Events Of Video Games,"This study suggests an approach for the computational modeling of players' emotional response patterns to story events in video games. We propose what is termed the dynamic narrative emotion model for analyzing the emotional response patterns of video game players by combining and reconstructing the OCC cognitive emotion model and D. Price's emotional intensity equation. Based on this model, we compared with two emotional response patterns of players to story events in both commercially successful and unsuccessful video games. The analysis was conducted with 360 emotional response values extracted from the playing experiences of 10 player's. The results showed that responses from commercially successful games are 3.3 times higher in terms of the frequency of emotion transitions, 1.3 times in terms of the number of emotion types, and twice as high in terms of the distance of an emotion transition compared to those of unsuccessful games. The results of this study can be applied by game designers with two implications for creating story-driven video games; first, to differentiate the emotional responses patterns of players in successful games from unsuccessful games, and second, to develop emotional transition strategies when designing story events in accordance with feedback from the players' emotional response patterns while playing the games. © 2010-2012 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TAFFC.2016.2519888,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing,"Kim M., Doh Y.Y.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Computer Based Data Acquisition In The Undergraduate Lab,This paper describes a Commodore 64 based data acquisition system used in the undergraduate laboratory at Georgia Tech. Special emphasis is placed on the design of an A/D Converter Board that consists of a Texas Instruments TLC 272 operational amplifier and the Analog Devices AD670 analog-to-digital converter. The AD670 is an 8-bit successive approximation converter capable of one million conversions per second. The A/D Converter Board has four programmable input ranges and is controlled through a machine language routine accessible to the user via a reserved memory buffer. Simons' BASIC is used by the students for all other programming tasks. The measurement of the viscosity of an unknown single-weight motor oil as a function of temperature is used to illustrate the capability of the data acquisition system. The viscosity is monitored through the A/D Converter Board while temperature is measured with a thermistor connected through the Commodore 64 game port. © 1987.,doi,10.1016/0360-1315(87)90043-1,Scopus,Computers and Education,"Wepfer W.J., Oehmke R.L.T.",1987,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Computer Game Playing In Adolescence: Prevalence And Demographic Indicators.,"Computer game playing is a popular activity among adolescents yet there have been no systematic studies in the U.K. on its prevalence and its demographics. A questionnaire study was undertaken with 387 adolescents (12–16 years of age) to establish the time spent playing computer games, who they first started playing with, the reasons why they first started and why they play now and negative consequences of play. Results revealed that for many adolescents, home computer game playing can take up considerable time with 7% of the sample playing for at least 30 hours a week. Although there were no differences between males and females in who played computer games, it was established that males were found to play significantly more regularly than females.",doi,10.1002/casp.2450050307,anderson2010,Journal of Community & Applied Social Psychology,"Griffiths, M.

,Control Of A Supernumerary Robotic Hand By Foot: An Experimental Study In Virtual Reality,"In the operational theater, the surgical team could highly benefit from a robotic supplementary hand under the surgeon's full control. The surgeon may so become more autonomous; this may reduce communication errors with the assistants and take over difficult tasks such as holding tools without tremor. In this paper, we therefore examine the possibility to control a third robotic hand with one foot's movements. Three experiments in virtual reality were designed to assess the feasibility of this control strategy, the learning curve of the subjects in different tasks and the coordination of foot movements with the two natural hands. Results show that the limbs are moved simultaneously, in parallel rather than serially. Participants' performance improved within a few minutes of practice without any specific difficulty to complete the tasks. Subjective assessment by the subjects indicated that controlling a third hand by foot has been easy and required only negligible physical and mental efforts. The sense of ownership was reported to improve through the experiments. The mental burden was not directly related to the level of motion required by a task, but depended on the type of activity and practice. The most difficult task was moving two hands and foot in opposite directions. These results suggest that a combination of practice and appropriate tasks can enhance the learning process for controlling a robotic hand by foot. © 2015 Abdi et al.",doi,10.1371/journal.pone.0134501,Scopus,PLoS ONE,"Abdi E., Burdet E., Bouri M., Bleuler H.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Coordinating Perceptually Grounded Categories Through Language: A Case Study For Colour,"This article proposes a number of models to examine through which mechanisms a population of autonomous agents could arrive at a repertoire of perceptually grounded categories that is sufficiently shared to allow successful communication. The models are inspired by the main approaches to human categorisation being discussed in the literature: Nativism, empiricism, and culturalism. Colour is taken as a case study. Although we take no stance on which position is to be accepted as final truth with respect to human categorisation and naming, we do point to theoretical constraints that make each position more or less likely and we make clear suggestions on what the best engineering solution would be. Specifically, we argue that the collective choice of a shared repertoire must integrate multiple constraints, including constraints coming from communication. © 2005 Cambridge University Press.",doi,10.1017/S0140525X05000087,Scopus,Behavioral and Brain Sciences,"Steels L., Belpaeme T.",2005,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Coping With Racial Discrimination: The Role Of Substance Use,"Three studies tested the hypothesis that the relation between perceived racial discrimination and substance use reported in previous research is moderated by use of substances as a coping mechanism. Studies 1 and 2 were experimental studies of African American adolescents' and young adults' reactions to a discrimination experience. Results revealed that those who endorsed substance use-as-coping reported more willingness to use substances after experiencing discrimination. Study 3 was a prospective study of the relation between perceived discrimination and substance use over an 8-year period in African American adolescents. Results demonstrated that discrimination is associated with increases in substance use, but only among adolescents who endorse substance use-as-coping. Together, these three studies provide evidence that experiencing discrimination has both short- and long-term detrimental effects on African Americans' substance use, but significantly more so for those who adopt a pattern of using substances as a coping mechanism. © 2012 American Psychological Association.",doi,10.1037/a0027711,Scopus,Psychology of Addictive Behaviors,"Gerrard M., Stock M.L., Roberts M.E., Gibbons F.X., O'Hara R.E., Weng C.-Y., Wills T.A.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Deciding To Defect: The Effects Of Video-Game Violence On Cooperative Behavior.,"This experiment examined the effect of videogame violence on cooperative decision making. Participants (N = 48) were randomly assigned to play either a violent or a nonviolent version of the video game Doom™ in dyads. Following the video-game task, participants were separated and given an opportunity to choose to cooperate with their partner for mutual gain, withdraw from the interaction, or exploit their partner for their own benefit. Participants in the violent condition were significantly more likely to choose to exploit their partners than participants in the nonviolent condition.

,Design And Analysis Of Collaborative Interactions In Social Educational Videogames,"Children with serious illness face enormous challenges in their daily life. These individuals must not only deal with the direct consequences of their disease, but they must often cope with being in a hospital or at home, being unable in many cases go to school. Frequently, connections with classmates, neighbours, and sometimes even some with relatives are lost. Therefore, entertainment and enjoyment should be provided in order to avoid boredom and to improve their affective state. Currently, children in the HUC (University Hospital of the Canary Islands) have a classroom with computers, books and toys supervised by a teacher. Children in their individual rooms are isolated. Social videogames can be a solution by allowing students to enhance their communication, education and entertainment possibilities. In this paper, we present the design, development and evaluation of a collaborative educational videogame prototype for hospitalised children based on a Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG) engine. Moreover, we present a case study of students' social and affective interactions using said videogame.

,Design And Development Of One-Switch Video Games For Children With Severe Motor Disabilities,"Video games are not just played for fun; they have become a handy instrument for the cognitive, emotional, and social development of children. However, several barriers prevent many children with disabilities from playing action-oriented video games, alone or with their peers. In particular, children with severe motor disabilities, who rely on one-switch interaction for accessing electronic devices, find fast-paced games that require rapid decision-making and timely responses, completely unplayable. This article contributes to lowering such barriers by presenting GNomon (Gaming NOMON), a software framework based on the NOMON mode of interaction that allows the creation of action-oriented single-switch video games. The article reports the results of two studies that evaluate the playability and rehabilitation suitability of GNomon-based video games. The playability of GNomon-based games is evaluated by assessing their learnability, effectiveness, errors, satisfaction, memorability, and enjoyability with a group of eight children with severe motor disabilities.The suitability for pediatric rehabilitation is determined by means of a focus group with a team of speech therapists, physiotherapists, and psychologists from a Local Health Agency in Turin, Italy. The results of the playability study are positive: All children had fun playing GNomon-based video games, and seven of eight were able to interact and play autonomously. The results of the rehabilitation-suitability study also entail that GNomon-based games can be exploited in training hand-eye coordination and maintenance of selective attention over time. The article finally offers critical hindsight and reflections and shows possible new future game concepts. © 2017 ACM.",doi,10.1145/3085957,Scopus,ACM Transactions on Accessible Computing,"López S.A., Corno F., De Russis L.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Design Of Prisoner's Dilemma Based Fuzzy Logic Computed Torque Controller With Lyapunov Synthesis Linguistic Model For Puma-560 Robot Manipulator,"The robot manipulators are highly nonlinear, time varying and one of the important challenges in the field of robotics is the effective control of manipulators. This paper presents a technique to extract the rules of Fuzzy Logic Computed Torque Controller for PUMA-560 robot arm with uncertainties. Fuzzy Logic Controllers are placed at the input of the PD Controller to make the gains adaptive. Prisoner's dilemma is employed to systematically tune the gains of the controller. The interrelations between inputs and outputs of a Fuzzy Linguistic Model are assigned using payoff matrix through Prisoner's Dilemma. The difficulty in designing of fuzzy controllers is the extraction of the rule base. The extraction of fuzzy control rules requires good understanding of the plant and control theory. The present paper utilizes Fuzzy Lyapunov Synthesis to constitute the rule base assuming that minimal knowledge about the plant to be controlled. Simulation results prove the effective performance of the proposed controller in minimizing the error in joint angles when compared to Proportional Derivative Computed Torque Controller (PD-CTC), normal Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) and that of the reference signal. © 2016 - IOS Press and the authors.",doi,10.3233/IFS-162147,Scopus,Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems,"Kumar C.R., Sudha K.R., Pushpalatha D.V.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas

,Differential Magnitude Coding Of Gains And Omitted Rewards In The Ventral Striatum,"Physiologic studies revealed that neurons in the dopaminergic midbrain of non-human primates encode reward prediction errors. It was furthermore shown that reward prediction errors are adaptively scaled with respect to the range of possible outcomes, enabling sensitive encoding for a large range of reward values. Congruently, neuroimaging studies in humans demonstrated that BOLD-responses in the ventral striatum encode reward prediction errors in similar fashion as dopaminergic midbrain neurons, suggesting that these BOLD-responses may be driven by dopaminergic midbrain activity. However, neuroimaging results are ambiguous with respect to the adaptive scaling of reward prediction errors, leading to the conjecture that under certain circumstances other than dopaminergic midbrain input may drive ventral striatal BOLD-responses. The goal of this study was to substantiate whether BOLD-responses in the ventral striatum rather respond to adaptively scaled reward prediction errors or absolute reward magnitude. In addition, we aimed to identify neuronal structures modulating activity in the ventral striatum. Sixteen healthy participants played a wheel of fortune game, where they could win three differently valued rewards while being scanned. BOLD-responses increased after gaining rewards; this gain was however independent of the absolute reward magnitude. In contrast BOLD-responses upon reward omission decreased with reward magnitude. A psychophysiological interaction analysis identified a cluster in the brainstem in proximity of the dorsal raphe nucleus, a cluster in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, and a cluster in the rostral cingulate zone. These clusters changed their connectivity with the ventral striatum in relation to the absolute reward magnitude in reward omission trials. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

,"Digital Game Violence And Direct Aggression In Adolescence: A Longitudinal Study Of The Roles Of Sex, Age, And Parent–Child Communication.","This study investigated the roles of sex, age, and parent–child communication in moderating the association between digital game violence and direct aggression in a two-year longitudinal study. Finnish 12- and 15-year-old adolescents (N = 316) participated in the follow-up survey. As hypothesized, digital game violence was linked to direct aggression both longitudinally and synchronously, and the link was moderated by parent–child communication in interaction with sex and age. Results suggest that the moderating role of parent–child communication changes with increasing age. Poor parent–child communication may be one of the factors in an adolescent's development that may strengthen the negative effects of digital game violence, but even good parent–child communication does not necessarily protect the adolescent in the long run.

,"Dissonance, Truth And The Political Limits Of Possibility In Mmos","This article argues and synthesizes two fundamental points about the Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMO), with World of Warcraft and Star Wars: The Old Republic serving as the chief examples of the genre. The first is that the use of ethical dilemmas in MMOs is a content-level manifestation of their unique fit to the current moment of late capitalism insofar as such dilemmas stage freedom of choice and action within a structure that restricts autonomy. The second is that the ludonarrative dissonance (via both Lukacs and Hocking) instigated by the merger of the closed, 'epic' form of the video game and the open-ended social aspects introduced in the MMO is a formal aesthetic response to late capitalism. These two threads of argument dovetail into a conclusion on the status of the MMO as a tool of hegemony - a cultural product that manifests and reinforces the norms of the present moment and at the same time has the potential to be repurposed for liberatory ends. © 2015 Intellect Ltd Article.",doi,10.1386/jgvw.7.2.141_1,Scopus,Journal of Gaming and Virtual Worlds,Weihl H.,2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Does Elicitation Method Matter? Behavioral And Neuroimaging Evidence From Capacity Allocation Game,"To date, it has not been elucidated whether the strategy method and the direct-response method lead to different behaviors in experiments of economic games. In this study, we investigate this issue under a multi-round setting of the capacity allocation game with both of the elicitation methods. In the first experiment (regular behavioral experiment), subjects are paired to make decisions in a laboratory through a computer network platform. In the second experiment (neuroimaging experiment), the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technique is applied to observe similarities and differences in brain activities between the two elicitation methods. The results show that no significant difference is observed in the ordering behaviors between the two methods. Meanwhile, the neuroimaging data reveal that the strategy method induces comparable activations in similar brain regions, as does the direct-response method. Additionally, it is more likely that subjects adjust their decisions during the feedback phase, rather than during the decision phase. Our results indicate that, in multi-round game experiments without features such as emotion, the effect of the elicitation method is not likely to be exhibited. © 2015 Production and Operations Management Society.",doi,10.1111/poms.12515,Scopus,Production and Operations Management,"Zhao Y., Zhao X., Wang L., Chen Y., Zhang X.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Dpcm-Based Edge Prediction For Lossless Screen Content Coding In Hevc,"Screen content sequences are ubiquitous type of video data in numerous multimedia applications like video conferencing, remote education, and cloud gaming. These sequences are characterized for depicting a mix of computer generated graphics, text, and camera-captured material. Such a mix poses several challenges, as the content usually depicts multiple strong discontinuities, which are hard to encode using current techniques. Differential pulse code modulation (DPCM)-based intra-prediction has shown to improve coding efficiency for these sequences. In this paper we propose sample-based edge and angular prediction (SEAP), a collection of DPCM-based intra-prediction modes to improve lossless coding of screen content. SEAP is aimed at accurately predicting regions depicting not only camera-captured material, but also those depicting strong edges. It incorporates modes that allow selecting the best predictor for each pixel individually based on the characteristics of the causal neighborhood of the target pixel. We incorporate SEAP into HEVC intra-prediction. Evaluation results on various screen content sequences show the advantages of SEAP over other DPCM-based approaches, with bit-rate reductions of up to 19.56% compared to standardized RDPCM.

,Dynamic Behaviours Of Mix-Game Model And Its Application,"In this paper a minority game (MG) is modified by adding into it some agents who play a majority game. Such a game is referred to as a mix-game. The highlight of this model is that the two groups of agents in the mix-game have different bounded abilities to deal with historical information and to count their own performance. Through simulations, it is found that the local volatilities change a lot by adding some agents who play the majority game into the MG and the change of local volatilities greatly depends on different combinations of historical memories of the two groups. Furthermore, the analyses of the underlying mechanisms for this finding are made. The applications of mix-game mode are also given as an example. © 2006 Chin. Phys.

,Effect Of Partition Board Color On Mood And Autonomic Nervous Function,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of the presence or absence (control) of a partition board and its color (red, yellow, blue) on subjective mood ratings and changes in autonomic nervous system indicators induced by a video game task. The increase in the mean Profile of Mood States (POMS) Fatigue score and mean Oppressive feeling rating after the task was lowest with the blue partition board. Multiple-regression analysis identified oppressive feeling and error scores on the second half of the task as statistically significant contributors to Fatigue. While explanatory variables were limited to the physiological indices, multiple-regression analysis identified a significant contribution of autonomic reactivity (assessed by heart rate variability) to Fatigue. These results suggest that a blue partition board would reduce task-induced subjective fatigue, in part by lowering the oppressive feeling of being enclosed during the task, possibly by increasing autonomic reactivity. © Perceptual and Motor Skills 2011.",doi,10.2466/03.14.22.PMS.113.6.941-956,Scopus,Perceptual and Motor Skills,"Sakuragi S., Sugiyama Y.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Effect Of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Combined With Gait And Mobility Training On Functionality In Children With Cerebral Palsy: Study Protocol For A Double-Blind Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial,"Background: The project proposes three innovative intervention techniques (treadmill training, mobility training with virtual reality and transcranial direct current stimulation that can be safely administered to children with cerebral palsy. The combination of transcranial stimulation and physical therapy resources will provide the training of a specific task with multiple rhythmic repetitions of the phases of the gait cycle, providing rich sensory stimuli with a modified excitability threshold of the primary motor cortex to enhance local synaptic efficacy and potentiate motor learning.Methods/design: A prospective, double-blind, randomized, controlled, analytical, clinical trial will be carried out.Eligible participants will be children with cerebral palsy classified on levels I, II and III of the Gross Motor Function Classification System between four and ten years of age. The participants will be randomly allocated to four groups: 1) gait training on a treadmill with placebo transcranial stimulation; 2) gait training on a treadmill with active transcranial stimulation; 3) mobility training with virtual reality and placebo transcranial stimulation; 4) mobility training with virtual reality and active transcranial stimulation. Transcranial direct current stimulation will be applied with the anodal electrode positioned in the region of the dominant hemisphere over C3, corresponding to the primary motor cortex, and the cathode positioned in the supraorbital region contralateral to the anode. A 1 mA current will be applied for 20 minutes. Treadmill training and mobility training with virtual reality will be performed in 30-minute sessions five times a week for two weeks (total of 10 sessions). Evaluations will be performed on four occasions: one week prior to the intervention; one week following the intervention; one month after the end of the intervention;and 3 months after the end of the intervention. The evaluations will involve three-dimensional gait analysis, analysis of cortex excitability (motor threshold and motor evoked potential), Six-Minute Walk Test, Timed Up-and-Go Test, Pediatric Evaluation Disability Inventory, Gross Motor Function Measure, Berg Balance Scale, stabilometry, maximum respiratory pressure and an effort test.Discussion: This paper offers a detailed description of a prospective, double-blind, randomized, controlled, analytical, clinical trial aimed at demonstrating the effect combining transcranial stimulation with treadmill and mobility training on functionality and primary cortex excitability in children with Cerebral Palsy classified on Gross Motor Function Classification System levels I, II and III. The results will be published and will contribute to evidence regarding the use of treadmill training on this population.Trial registration: ReBEC RBR-9B5DH7. © 2013 Grecco et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",doi,10.1186/1471-2431-13-168,Scopus,BMC Pediatrics,"Grecco L.A.C., Duarte N.D.A.C., de Mendonça M.E., Pasini H., Lima V.L.C.D.C., Franco R.C., de Oliveira L.V.F., de Carvalho P.D.T.C., Corrêa J.C.F., Collange N.Z., Sampaio L.M.M., Galli M., Fregni F., Oliveira C.S.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Effects Of An Exercise Intervention Using Dance Dance Revolution On Endothelial Function And Other Risk Factors In Overweight Children,"Objective. To determine whether an exercise intervention using an active video game (Dance Dance Revolution™ [DDR]) is effective in improving endothelial dysfunction (EDF) and other risk factors in overweight children. Design. Thirty-five children (Body mass index ≥ 85th percentile, mean age 10.21±1.67 years, 17 females) with EDF were assessed for flow-mediated dilation (FMD), lipids, insulin, glucose, NO2+NO3, asymmetric dimethylarginine, symmetric dimethylarginine, l-arginine, height, weight, aerobic fitness, and blood pressure. In a subsample, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, and adiponectin were also assessed. Subjects were randomly assigned to 12-weeks of aerobic exercise (EX) using DDR or to a non-exercising delayed-treatment control group (DTC). Results. EX had significant improvements in FMD ( 5.56±5.04% compared with 0.263±4.54%, p=0.008), exercise time on the graded exercise test (53.59±91.54 compared with -12.83±68.10 seconds, p=0.025), mean arterial pressure (MAP) (-5.62±7.03 compared with-1.44±2.16 mmHg, p=0.05), weight (0.91±1.53 compared with 2.43±1.80 kg, p=0.017) and peak VO2 (2.38±3.91 compared with-1.23±3.18 mg/kg/min, p=0.005) compared with the DTC. Thirteen EX subjects achieved normal EDF while ten did not. These groups differed at baseline with regard to total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Conclusion. Twelve weeks of DDR-use improved FMD, aerobic fitness, and MAP in overweight children. Improvements occurred without changes in inflammatory markers or nitric oxide production. The results document the need to explore relationships between obesity, endothelial function, inflammation, lipids, exercise intensity, and gender in a larger sample of overweight children. © 2009 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved.",doi,10.3109/17477160902846187,Scopus,International Journal of Pediatric Obesity,"Murphy E.C.-S., Carson L., Neal W., Baylis C., Donley D., Yeater R.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Effects Of Automation And Task Load On Task Switching During Human Supervision Of Multiple Semi-Autonomous Robots In A Dynamic Environment,"The present study assessed the impact of task load and level of automation (LOA) on task switching in participants supervising a team of four or eight semi-autonomous robots in a simulated 'capture the flag' game. Participants were faster to perform the same task than when they chose to switch between different task actions. They also took longer to switch between different tasks when supervising the robots at a high compared to a low LOA. Task load, as manipulated by the number of robots to be supervised, did not influence switch costs. The results suggest that the design of future unmanned vehicle (UV) systems should take into account not simply how many UVs an operator can supervise, but also the impact of LOA and task operations on task switching during supervision of multiple UVs. The findings of this study are relevant for the ergonomics practice of UV systems. This research extends the cognitive theory of task switching to inform the design of UV systems and results show that switching between UVs is an important factor to consider.",doi,10.1080/00140139.2010.489969,Scopus,Ergonomics,"Squire P.N., Parasuraman R.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Effects Of Different Post-Match Recovery Interventions On Subsequent Athlete Hormonal State And Game Performance,"We tested the effects of different post-match recovery interventions on the subsequent hormonal responses to a physical stress-test and game performance in professional rugby union players. On four occasions, participants (n = 12) completed a video session (1. h each) with accompanying coach feedback the day after a rugby union match. The interventions showed either video footage of player mistakes with negative coach feedback (NCF1) or player successes with positive feedback (PCF1). Both approaches were repeated (NCF2 and PCF2). In the following week, participants were assessed for their free testosterone (T) and cortisol (C) responses to a physical stress-test, pre-game T and game-ranked performance. The PFC1 and PCF2 approaches were both associated with significantly (p< 0.01) greater free T (36% to 42%) responses to the stress-test when compared to NCF1 and NCF2 (16% to - 3%), respectively. The PCF interventions were also associated with higher (28% to 51%) pre-game T concentrations and superior game-ranked performances than the NCF approaches (p< 0.01). In conclusion, the post-game presentation of specific video footage combined with different coach feedbacks appeared to influence the free hormonal state of rugby players and game performance several days later. Therefore, within the sporting context, future behaviour and performance might be modified through the use of simple psychological strategies. These data are applicable to generalised human stress responses and their modifiability by prior exposure to a stressor. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",doi,10.1016/j.physbeh.2012.03.015,Scopus,Physiology and Behavior,"Crewther B.T., Cook C.J.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Effects Of Interactive Video Game Cycling On Overweight And Obese Adolescent Health,"The purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy of interactive video game stationary cycling (GameBike) in comparison with stationary cycling to music on adherence, energy expenditure measures, submaximal aerobic fitness, body composition, and cardiovascular disease risk markers in overweight and obese adolescents, using a randomized controlled trial design. Thirty overweight (with at least 1 metabolic complication) or obese adolescents aged 12-17 years were stratified by gender and randomized to video game or music condition, with 4 participants (2 per group) failing to complete the twice weekly 60 min sessions of the 10-week trial. The music group had a higher rate of attendance compared with the video game group (92% vs. 86%, p < 0.05). Time spent in minutes per session at vigorous intensity (80%-100% of predicted peak heart rate) (24.9 ± 20 min vs. 13.7 ± 12.8 min, p < 0.05) and average distance (km) pedaled per session (12.5 ± 2.8 km vs. 10.2 ± 2.2 km, p < 0.05) also favoured the music group. However, both interventions produced significant improvements in submaximal indicators of aerobic fitness as measured by a graded cycle ergometer protocol. Also, when collapsed, the exercise modalities reduced body fat percentage and total cholesterol. The present study indicates that cycling to music was just as effective as stationary cycling while playing video games at improving fitness, body composition, and cholesterol profiles in overweight and obese teens, and resulted in increased attendance, vigorous intensity of physical activity, and distance pedaled. Therefore, our data support the superiority of cycling to music and indicate investing in the more expensive GameBike may not be worth the cost.",doi,10.1139/H10-078,Scopus,"Applied Physiology, Nutrition and Metabolism","Adamo K.B., Rutherford J.A., Goldfield G.S.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,"Effects Of Racing Games On Risky Driving Behaviour, And The Significance Of Personality And Physiological Data","Background Racing games have emerged as topselling products in the video and computer game industry. The effect of playing racing games on the inclination of gamers to take risks has been investigated. Method Two experiments were conducted. In experiment 1, the impact of personality traits on the effects of playing racing games on risk-taking inclination was examined. The Vienna Test System, which includes the Eysenck Personality Profile Test and the Vienna Risk- Taking Test, was used to measure risk-taking inclination and risk-taking while driving. Experiment 2 was designed and conducted to analyse the effects of different intensity levels of car racing games on risk-taking inclination, and to study the relationship between physiological data and risk-taking inclination. Physiological data on skin conductance, heart rate and blood pressure were measured with the NeuroDyne System. Results Participants playing a racing game were more inclined to take risks in critical road traffic situations than those playing a neutral game. The adventurousness dimension of the Eysenck Personality Profile Test correlated significantly positively with risk-taking inclination. More importantly, the effect of the intensity level of a racing game on risk-taking inclination was significant. The higher the intensity level of the racing game, the higher the risk-taking inclination while driving. The effect of intensity level of the racing game on skin conductance was significantly positive. Skin conductance correlated significantly positively with risk-taking inclination. Conclusions The effect of playing racing games on risk-taking inclination is linked to personality and physiological data. Some recommendations are proposed as a result of this study for racing game management. © 2015, BMJ Publishing Group.

,Effects Of Videogame Distraction Using A Virtual Reality Type Head-Mounted Display Helmet On Cold Pressor Pain In Children.,"OBJECTIVE: To test whether a head-mounted display helmet enhances the effectiveness of videogame distraction for children experiencing cold pressor pain. METHOD: Forty-one children, aged 6-14 years, underwent one or two baseline cold pressor trials followed by two distraction trials in which they played the same videogame with and without the helmet in counterbalanced order. Pain threshold (elapsed time until the child reported pain) and pain tolerance (total time the child kept the hand submerged in the cold water) were measured for each cold pressor trial. RESULTS: Both distraction conditions resulted in improved pain tolerance relative to baseline. Older children appeared to experience additional benefits from using the helmet, whereas younger children benefited equally from both conditions. The findings suggest that virtual reality technology can enhance the effects of distraction for some children. Research is needed to identify the characteristics of children for whom this technology is best suited.",doi,10.1093/jpepsy/jsn023,Scopus,Journal of pediatric psychology,"Dahlquist L.M., Weiss K.E., Clendaniel L.D., Law E.F., Ackerman C.S., McKenna K.D.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Effects Of Violent And Non-Violent Computer Game Content On Memory Performance In Adolescents,"The present study focuses on the short-term effects of electronic entertainment media on memory and learning processes. It compares the effects of violent versus nonviolent computer game content in a condition of playing and in another condition of watching the same game. The participants consisted of 83 female and 94 male adolescents with a mean age of 17.6 years. The dependent variables are memory for previously learnt verbal and visual material, memory for media-related content and physiological measures of stress (heart rate, cortisol, salivary alpha-amylase). Besides the group comparisons, potential mediation effects and gender differences were examined. The results show that violent content leads to a poorer memory performance for verbal material and to an increased heart rate. The heart rate, however, does not mediate the effect on memory performance. Genders differ regarding their abilities to memorise verbal and visual material, with females showing a better performance (independent of the experimental condition), and for memorising media-contents, where the males outperform females (also independent of experimental condition). The study supports the assumption that violent and arousing media content has a negative short-term effect on simultaneous information processing and learning and that there are gender-specific media effects. © Instituto Superior de Psicologia Aplicada, Lisboa, Portugal and Springer Science+Business Media BV 2010.",doi,10.1007/s10212-010-0047-0,Scopus,European Journal of Psychology of Education,"Maass A., Kollhörster K., Riediger A., MacDonald V., Lohaus A.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas

Type A subjects exhibited greater impatience than Type B subjects.

,Elementary Approaches To The Teaching Of The Combinatorial Problem Of Rectangular Islands,"In this paper the problem of rectangular islands was investigated. We advocate that the topic is particularly suitable for teaching in different levels. First, the occurring problems are part of current mathematical research with still open problems. This could motivate our talented students for active autonomous problem solving and bring the groups of researchers, educators and students closer. The presented computer supported tools enable an emphasis shift from the frontal teaching to project based, self-paced or active small group learning. By manipulating the size of the grid, the water level, or the height of a cell with suitable graphical interface elements, the learner becomes an active part of the discovery and learning process. The introduced graphical representations can be studied dynamically and parallel with the interactive demonstrations and games designed by the authors. The concrete representations, and constructions can facilitate the discovery of patterns and can lead to invention of general conjectures. In fact, the authors of the paper ourselves found some results in 4.1-2.4 in this way. We computed values for several small fixed sized grids, detected patterns for establishing a recursion and finally resolved them. For the investigation of integer sequences there are built-in functions in computer algebra systems like Mathematica, or there is a web resource, an online encyclopedia for looking up interesting integer sequences by just knowing their first few entries (http://www.research.att.com/~njas/ sequences/). The experimental activity complements, but does not replace, the essential part of the mathematical activity: the rigorous theorem proving. For doing so, we used some elementary results from the theory of linear recurrences and graphs and applied induction and the method of two-sided estimation. We deduced the maximal number of islands in the rectangular grid with the latter techniques. We note that we are going to use the Theorema proving system (Windsteiger et al. 2006) for supporting the formulation of the predicates and functions of the island theory in a more formal language and for facilitating the computation and proving phase of the exploration with computers. It is noted that even if the obtained lower and upper bounds would have been different, the efforts for establishing those bounds are not in vain and there is no a priori guarantee that the exact solution has a nice closed form. In fact, if the number of triangular islands in a grid with size n is denoted by f(n), according to Horváth et al. (2009), it is ""only"" known that n2+3n 5 ≤ f (n) ≤ n2+9n+2 14 . The grid and cell model we have considered can also be a link between different disciplines. There are other examples requiring only m 9 n cells on a rectangular grid; for example, aij may mean a colour on a gray-scale (before we convert the picture to black and white), transparency (against X-rays), or melting temperature. The technique of gradual increase of the water level is applied successfully in medical image processing (Beucher and Lantuejoul 1979). This outlook may also motivate our students to consider mathematics not as an abstract sterile world, but rather as the general technique of systematic problem solving with real applications. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",doi,10.1007/s10758-010-9171-9,Scopus,International Journal of Computers for Mathematical Learning,"Máder A., Vajda R.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Elite Futsal Refereeing: Activity Profile And Physiological Demands,"Rebelo, AN, Ascensao, AA, Magalhaes, JF, Bischoff, R, Bendiksen, M, and Krustrup, P. Elite futsal refereeing: activity profile and physiological demands. J Strength Cond Res 25(4): 980-987, 2011-The purpose of this study was to determine the physiological demands and to establish the relationship between activity profile and endurance capacity of futsal referees. Eighteen elite futsal referees (33.0 6 5.1 years, 173 6 5 cm, and 73.2 6 8.4 kg) were studied. Video filming (n = 18) and heart rate (HR) recordings were performed throughout games. Blood lactate (n = 14) was determined at rest and after the game. Endurance capacity was determined with the Yo-Yo IE2. The number of activity changes was as high as 1,395 6 218 (6SD). Total distance covered, high-intensity running (HIR), sprinting (SPR), and sideways running were 5.89 6 0.56, 0.96 6 0.29, 0.09 6 0.07, and 0.91 6 0.46 km, respectively. The number of HIR and SPR bouts was 129 6 41 and 9 6 8, respectively, with a mean duration of ∼1.4 seconds. Blood lactate content was 1.0 6 0.3 and 1.5 6 0.5 mM before and after the game. The amount of HIR performed during the match correlated significantly (r = 0.77; p < 0.05) with the Yo-Yo IE2 performance. Considering the data obtained in the present study, the use of match-specific intermittent fitness tests to evaluate futsal referees seems to be required. © 2011 National Strength and Conditioning Association.",doi,10.1519/JSC.0b013e3181a392ed,Scopus,Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research,"Rebelo A.N., Ascensao A.A., Magalhaes J.F., Bischoff R., Bendiksen M., Krustrup P.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Emergence Of Cooperative Internet Server Sharing Among Internet Search Agents Caught In The N-Person Prisoner's Dilemma Game,"Information on the Internet can be collected by autonomous agents that send out queries to the servers that may have the information sought. From a single agent's perspective, sending out as many queries as possible maximizes the chances of finding the information sought. However, if every agent does the same, the servers will be overloaded. The first major contribution of this paper is proving mathematically that the agents situated in such environments play the n-Person Prisoner's Dilemma Game. The second is mathematically deriving the notion of effectiveness of cooperation among the agents in such environments and then presenting the optimal interval for the number of information sites for a given number of information-seeking agents. When the optimal interval is satisfied, cooperation among agents is effective, meaning that resources (e.g., servers) are optimally shared. Experimental results suggest that agents can better share available servers through the kinship-based cooperation without explicitly knowing about the entire environment. This paper also identifies difficulties of promoting cooperation in such environments and presents possible solutions. The long-term goal of this research is to elucidate the understanding of massively distributed multiagent environments such as the Internet and to identify valuable design principles of software agents in similar environments. © 2004 Springer-Verlag London Ltd.",doi,10.1007/s10115-003-0117-6,Scopus,Knowledge and Information Systems,Oh J.C.,2005,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Emotional Intelligence Buffers The Effect Of Physiological Arousal On Dishonesty.,"We studied the emotional processes that allow people to balance two competing desires: benefitting from dishonesty and keeping a positive self-image. We recorded physiological arousal (skin conductance and heart rate) during a computer card game in which participants could cheat and fail to report a certain card when presented on the screen to avoid losing their money. We found that higher skin conductance corresponded to lower cheating rates. Importantly, emotional intelligence regulated this effect; participants with high emotional intelligence were less affected by their physiological reactions than those with low emotional intelligence. As a result, they were more likely to profit from dishonesty. However, no interaction emerged between heart rate and emotional intelligence. We suggest that the ability to manage and control emotions can allow people to overcome the tension between doing right or wrong and license them to bend the rules.",doi,10.3758/s13423-017-1285-9,pubmed,Psychonomic bulletin &amp; review,"Pittarello, Andrea; Conte, Beatrice; Caserotti, Marta; Scrimin, Sara; Rubaltelli, Enrico",2017,NA,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Emotions In Serious Games: From Experience To Assessment,"Serious Games represent a global revolution that promises to develop intuitive, affordable, accessible and familiar learning environments for a wide range of educational and training applications. Serious Games are computer or video games in which education is the primary goal, rather than entertainment.

Among the different assets that Serious Games provide for learning, we will focus in this paper on their ability to leverage the synergy between emotional and learning appropriation processes. We will first outline the specific features of learning opportunities offered by Serious Games considering the involvement of emotions in this learning process.

,Energy Expended By Boys Playing Active Video Games,"The purpose of this study was to: (1) determine energy expenditure (EE) during a range of active video games (AVGs) and (2) determine whether EE during AVGs is influenced by gaming experience or fitness. Twenty-six boys (11.4±0.8 years) participated and performed a range of sedentary activities (resting, watching television and sedentary gaming), playing AVGs (Nintendo® Wii Bowling, Boxing, Tennis, and Wii Fit Skiing and Step), walking and running including a maximal fitness test. During all activities, oxygen uptake, heart rate and EE were determined. The AVGs resulted in a significantly higher EE compared to rest (63-190%, p≤0.001) and sedentary screen-time activities (56-184%, p≤0.001). No significant differences in EE were found between the most active video games and walking. There was no evidence to suggest that gaming experience or aerobic fitness influenced EE when playing AVGs. In conclusion, boys expended more energy during active gaming compared to sedentary activities. Whilst EE during AVG is game-specific, AVGs are not intense enough to contribute towards the 60min of daily moderate-to-vigorous physical activity that is currently recommended for children. © 2010 Sports Medicine Australia.",doi,10.1016/j.jsams.2010.07.005,Scopus,Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport,"White K., Schofield G., Kilding A.E.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Energy Intake Adaptations To Acute Isoenergetic Active Video Games And Exercise Are Similar In Obese Adolescents,"Background/Objectives:Although the impact of passive video games (PVGs) on energy intake has been previously explored in lean adolescents, data are missing on the nutritional adaptations to passive and active video games (AVGs) in obese adolescents. It is also unknown whether isoenergetic AVGs and exercise (EX) differently affect food consumption in youth.Subjects/Methods:Nineteen obese adolescent boys (12-15 years old) had to complete four 1-hour sessions in a crossover manner: control (CON; sitting on a chair), PVG (boxing game on Xbox 360), AVG (boxing game on Xbox Kinect 360) and EX (cycling). The EX was calibrated to generate the same energy expenditure as the AVG session. Energy expenditure was measured using a K4b2 portable indirect calorimeter. Ad libitum food intake (buffet-style meal) and appetite sensations (visual analogue scales) were assessed after the sessions.Results:As expected, mean energy expenditure was similar between AVG (370±4 kcal) and EX (358±3 kcal), both of which were significantly higher than PVG (125±7 kcal) and CON (98±5 kcal) (P<0.001). However, ad libitum food intake after the sessions was not significantly different between CON (1174±282 kcal), PVG (1124±281 kcal), AVG (1098±265 kcal) and EX (1091±290 kcal). Likewise, the energy derived from fat, carbohydrate and protein was not significantly different between sessions, and appetite sensations were not affected.Conclusions:Energy intake and food preferences after an hour of AVG or PVG playing remain unchanged, and isoenergetic sessions of AVG and EX at moderate intensity induce similar nutritional responses in obese adolescent boys. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",doi,10.1038/ejcn.2015.31,Scopus,European Journal of Clinical Nutrition,"Chaput J.P., Schwartz C., Boirie Y., Duclos M., Tremblay A., Thivel D.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Enhancement Of Allergic Skin Wheal Responses In Patients With Atopic Eczema/Dermatitis Syndrome By Playing Video Games Or By A Frequently Ringing Mobile Phone,"Background: Playing video games causes physical and psychological stress, including increased heart rate and blood pressure and aggression-related feelings. Use of mobile phones is very popular in Japan, and frequent ringing is a common and intrusive part of Japanese life. Atopic eczema/dermatitis syndrome is often exacerbated by stress. Stress increases serum IgE levels, skews cytokine pattern towards Th2 type, enhances allergen-induced skin wheal responses, and triggers mast cell degranulation via substance P, vasoactive intestinal peptide and nerve growth factor. Materials and methods: (1) In the video game study, normal subjects (n = 25), patients with allergic rhinitis (n = 25) or atopic eczema/dermatitis syndrome (n = 25) played a video game (STREET FIGHTER II) for 2 h. Before and after the study, allergen-induced wheal responses, plasma levels of substance P, vasoactive intestinal peptide and nerve growth factor, and in vitro production of total IgE, antihouse dust mite IgE and cytokines were measured. (2) In the mobile phone study, normal subjects (n = 27), patients with allergic rhinitis (n = 27) or atopic eczema/dermatitis syndrome (n = 27) were exposed to 30 incidences of ringing mobile phones during 30 min. Before and after the study, allergen-induced wheal responses, plasma levels of substance P, vasoactive intestinal peptide and nerve growth factor were measured. Results: Playing video games had no effect on the normal subjects or the patients with allergic rhinitis. In contrast, playing video games significantly enhanced allergen-induced skin wheal responses and increased plasma levels of substance P, vasoactive intestinal peptide and nerve growth factors in the patients with atopic eczema/dermatitis syndrome. Moreover, playing video games enhanced in vitro production of total IgE and anti-house dust mite IgE with concomitant increased production of IL-4, IL-10 and IL-13 and decreased production of IFN-γ and IL-12 in the patients with atopic eczema/dermatitis syndrome. However, exposure to frequently ringing mobile phones significantly enhanced allergen-induced skin wheal responses, plasma levels of substance P, vasoactive intestinal peptide and nerve growth factors in the patients with atopic eczema/dermatitis syndrome, but not in the normal subjects or the patients with allergic rhinitis. Conclusion: Playing video games enhanced allergic responses with a concomitant increased release of substance P, vasoactive intestinal peptide and nerve growth factor, and skewing of the cytokine pattern toward Th2 type in the patients with atopic eczema/dermatitis syndrome. In addition, exposure to frequently ringing mobile phones also enhanced allergic responses with a concomitant increased release of substance P, vasoactive intestinal peptide and nerve growth factor Collectively, high technology causes stress, which in turn may aggravate symptoms of atopic eczema/dermatitis syndrome.",doi,10.1046/j.1365-2362.2003.01177.x,Scopus,European Journal of Clinical Investigation,Kimata H.,2003,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Enhancing Instructional Outcomes With Gamification: An Empirical Test Of The Technology-Enhanced Training Effectiveness Model,"Background Gamification, the use of game elements in non-game contexts, has become a popular technique to improve instructional outcomes in both organizational and educational contexts. In the organizational context, the Technology-Enhanced Training Effectiveness Model [TETEM] provides a framework to understand how technologies, like gamification, can effect change in various instructional outcomes. Specifically, application of TETEM suggests that gamification may not effect change in instructional outcomes when learner attitudes towards game-based learning and experience with video games are low. Method In this study, we test this model in the gamification context by assigning potential learners to read scenarios describing gamified instruction or traditional, PowerPoint instruction in a random order and assessing their training valence. Results On average, participants anticipated greater value from gamified instruction, but as predicted by TETEM, this effect was moderated by both video game experience and attitudes towards game-based learning. Among potential learners with high experience and attitudes, gamification produces better outcomes than PowerPoint, but among potential learners with low experience and attitudes, gamification produces worse outcomes than PowerPoint. Implications We provide empirical support for TETEM and conclude that for gamification to be successful, the attitudes and experience of participants must be assessed and ensured before gamification is implemented. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd",doi,10.1016/j.chb.2015.07.031,Scopus,Computers in Human Behavior,"Landers R.N., Armstrong M.B.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Enhancing The Navigability In A Social Network Of Smart Objects: A Shapley-Value Based Approach,"The Internet of Things (IoT) holds the promise to interconnect any possible object capable of providing useful information about the physical world for the benefit of humans' quality of life. The increasing number of heterogeneous objects that the IoT has to manage introduces crucial scalability issues that still need appropriate solutions. In this respect, one promising proposal is the Social IoT (SIoT) paradigm, whose main principle is to enable objects to autonomously establish social links with each other (adhering to rules set by their owners). ""Friend"" objects exchange data in a distributed manner and this avoids centralized solutions to implement major functions, such as: node discovery, information search, and trustworthiness management. However, the number and types of established friendships affect network navigability. This issue is the focus of this paper, which proposes an efficient, distributed and dynamic solution for the objects to select the right friends for the benefit of the overall network connectivity. The proposed friendship selection mechanism relies on a game theoretic model and a Shapley-value based algorithm. Two different utility functions are defined and evaluated based on either a group degree centrality and an average local clustering parameter. The comparison in terms of global navigability is measured in terms of average path length for the interconnection of any couple of nodes in the network. Results show that the group degree centrality brings to an enhanced degree of navigability thanks to the ability to create a suitable core of hubs. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

,Eternal Triangulation: Case Studies In The Evaluation Of Educational Software By Classroom-Based Teacher Groups,"The paper begins by reviewing some problematic issues in the evaluation of educational software. Special attention is drawn to the formal and practical difficulties associated with ""classical"" input/output evaluation paradigms. These problems are especially acute in the case of the vast range of computer-based materials which do not readily fall into the conventional CAL mould. Such software includes adventure games, word processors, spreadsheets etc. We examine the evaluation process in terms of its clientele. We suggest that administrators, working at the strategic level of decision making, and teachers working at the tactical level, have needs for rather different types of information, which cannot necessarily be met through the application of any single approach to evaluation. We identify our particular clientele as being classroom teachers, and we discuss the implications of this targeting for the design of evaluation procedures. We discuss the central role of the practitioners themselves in generating an appropriate richness and variety of information. We describe the development of ""IN-CITES"": a classroom-based case study approach to software evaluation intended for application by autonomous self-programming groups of teachers. This approach is based on the so-called ""triangulation"" methodology, and employs both methodological triangulation (using a range of techniques) and observational triangulation (using a variety of observational perspectives). Our approach is designed to provide teachers with a framework for software evaluation, rather than a rigidly denned set of procedures. We acknowledge that many teachers have specialised knowledge and skills which they will wish to bring to bear on their own problems, and we have worked to provide the outlines of a disciplined approach to the evaluation process analogous to the case history method in routine medical practice. © 1988.",doi,10.1016/0360-1315(88)90070-X,Scopus,Computers and Education,"Smith D., Keep R.",1988,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Evaluation Of A Manual Wheelchair Interface To Computer Games,"The sedentary lifestyle of many people with spinal cord injury (SCI) has lead to cardiovascular diseases being a major health concern. A suitable exercise program may help improve the SCI individual's cardiovascular fitness level. GAMEWheels is an in terface between a custom wheelchair roller system and a computer that enables an individual to control computer video games by driving his or her wheelchair. The purpose of Phase 1 was to evaluate the design of the GAMEwhccls system and to determine the type of computer video game that is likely to motivate wheelchair users to exercise. Phase 2 included physiologic testing of wheelchair users and the GAMEWheels system to investigate whether the system elicits an exercise training re sponse. Thirty-five subjects were recruited to evaluate the GAMEWheels by playing three commercial computer games (Phase 1) and to identify the computer game that they would prefer to use when exercising. The feedback from Phase 1 was used with test subjects to verify that the GAMEWheels system elicits an exercise training effect (Phase 2). Phase 2 included 10 subjects using the GAMEWheels system to play Need for Speed II. During game play, physiologic data were collected and the subjects' oxy gen consumption and heart rate were analyzed. Analysis showed that the GAMEWheels system induced nine subjects to reach their training zone, defined as 50% and 60% of their maximum oxygen consumption and heart rate, respectively. This study demon strates that the GAMEWheels system elicits an exercise training response. © 2000, Sage Publications.

,Evaluation Of Cognitive Behavior Among Deaf Subjects With Video Game As Intervention,"Previous research on video gaming mainly focused on negative impact on users. In this study, the positive impact of action video gaming among congenitally deaf subjects is investigated. Subjects possessed high level of visual information processing capacity. A 96 h of action video game play resulted in the improvement of mean reaction time (mRT) (post = 413.21 ms, pre = 453.39 ms) and certain cognitive functions. Higher heart rate variability (HRV) subjects demonstrated faster and significant improvement in mRT (p < 0.0045) after intervention. The α and β EEG band powers were found increased in parietal (6.33%, 4.28%) and occipital (8.38%, 38%) lobes respectively. The θ band power increased in frontal (32%) and parietal (13%) lobes. These results can reflect enhancement in certain cognitive performances such as visual perception, attention, memory, and motor skills. The ratio index β/(α + θ) increased in frontal and occipital lobes while β/θ increased in frontal and temporal lobes. These results may also suggest improvements in attention processing capacity and neural activity. These results implies improvements in certain aspects of cognition among deaf subjects. However, to validate these results a further study on larger number of samples with advanced computerized cognitive battery testing can be employed. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",doi,10.1016/j.cogsys.2016.11.007,Scopus,Cognitive Systems Research,"Nagendra H., Kumar V., Mukherjee S.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,"Evaluation Of The Emotional Education Program ""Happy 8-12"" For The Assertive Resolution Of Conflicts Among Peers","Introduction. Coexistence in schools inevitably implies conflicts among peers, which can have a negative impact inboth the students' well-being and their academic achievement. In this sense, the main objective of the present article is to introduce and describe the evaluation of the Training Program in Emotional Management Happy 8-12. This software focuses on the education of the pupils' emotional competences in order to solve conflicts in an assertive way. The program consists of 25 conflicts which students need to solve according to the management program of emotions developed by the Psychopedagogic Orientation Group (GROP). Method. The sample of the study consisted of 574 students of 5th and 6th grade of primary education. 301 of the participants were boys (52.4%) and 273 were girls (47.6%). Average age was 10.53, with a standard deviation of.662. The design employed in the present work was a quasi experimental design with pretest and posttest with a control group. The instruments and techniques used for the evaluation were: QDE, STAIC, CES, playground climate, anecdotic registration of conflict behaviours and academic performance. Results. Our results indicated that Happy 8-12 significantly improved the emotional competences of the students, reduced anxiety levels, and ameliorated the atmosphere in both the playground and in the class, noticeably augmenting the academic success. Conclusión. The results of this study show that training the management of emotions improves students' well-being at the same time that it acts as a preventive strategy for more severe disruptive behaviours, such as bullying. It also optimises the coexistence in the educative centres. © Education & Psychology I+D+i and Ilustre Colegio Oficial de la Psicología de Andalucía Oriental (Spain).",doi,10.14204/ejrep.40.15164,Scopus,Electronic Journal of Research in Educational Psychology,"Filella Guiu G., Cabello E., Pérez-Escoda N., Ros-Morente A.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas

,Evaluations Of Emotional Noninterpersonal Situations By Patients With Borderline Personality Disorder,"According to cognitive models of borderline personality disorder (BPD), an important cause for the instability of patients with BPD is dichotomous thinking (DT). Object-relation theories assume that the similar phenomenon of splitting is central in BPD. Previous studies focusing on interpersonal situations found support for DT being prominent in BPD. The aim of this study was to investigate whether patients with BPD also make use of dichotomous and schema-specific evaluations in noninterpersonal situations. An experiment was designed in which a frustrating and rewarding situation was induced by computer games that subjects had to play. Participants evaluated both themselves and the games. Patients with BPD (n=24) were characterized by somewhat more extreme game evaluations in the emotionally negative situations than normal controls (n=25), participants with a cluster C (n=10) or an anti-social personality disorder (ASPD) (n=16). Patients with BPD appeared to be characterized best by a general negative evaluative style, more than by DT or splitting. ASPD participants showed a positivity bias in both conditions. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

,Event-Related Potential Correlates Of Interference Effects On Recognition Memory,"The question of interference (how new learning affects previously acquired knowledge and vice versa) is a central theoretical issue in episodic memory research, but very few human neuroimaging studies have addressed this question. Here, we used event-related potentials (ERPs) to test the predictions of the complementary learning systems (CLS) model regarding how list strength manipulations (strengthening some, but not all, items on a study list) affect recognition memory. Our analysis focused on the FN400 old-new effect, a hypothesized ERP correlate of familiarity-based recognition, and the parietal old-new effect, a hypothesized ERP correlate of recollection-based recognition. As is predicted by the CLS model, increasing list strength selectively reduced the ERP correlate of recollection-based discrimination, leaving the ERP correlate of familiarity-based discrimination intact. In a second experiment, we obtained converging evidence for the CLS model's predictions, using a remember/know test: Increasing list strength reduced recollection-based discrimination but did not reduce familiarity-based discrimination.

,Evolutionary Prisoner’s Dilemma Games With Voluntary Participation,"Voluntary participation in public good games has recently been demonstrated to be a simple yet effective mechanism to avoid deadlocks in states of mutual defection and to promote persistent cooperative behavior. Apart from cooperators and defectors a third strategical type is considered: the risk averse loners who are unwilling to participate in the social enterprise and rather rely on small but fixed earnings. This results in a rock-scissors-paper type of cyclic dominance of the three strategies. In the prisoner’s dilemma, the effects of voluntary participation crucially depend on the underlying population structure. While leading to homogeneous states of all loners in well-mixed populations, we demonstrate that cyclic dominance produces self-organizing patterns on square lattices but leads to different types of oscillatory behavior on random regular graphs: the temptation to defect determines whether damped, periodic, or increasing oscillations occur. These Monte Carlo simulations are complemented by predictions from pair approximation reproducing the results for random regular graphs particularly well. © 2002 The American Physical Society.",doi,10.1103/PhysRevE.66.062903,Scopus,"Physical Review E - Statistical Physics, Plasmas, Fluids, and Related Interdisciplinary Topics","Szabó G., Hauert C.",2002,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Excessive Computer Game Playing: Evidence For Addiction And Aggression?,"Computer games have become an ever-increasing part of many adolescents' day-to-day lives. Coupled with this phenomenon, reports of excessive gaming (computer game playing) denominated as ""computer/video game addiction"" have been discussed in the popular press as well as in recent scientific research. The aim of the present study was the investigation of the addictive potential of gaming as well as the relationship between excessive gaming and aggressive attitudes and behavior. A sample comprising of 7069 gamers answered two questionnaires online. Data revealed that 11.9% of participants (840 gamers) fulfilled diagnostic criteria of addiction concerning their gaming behavior, while there is only weak evidence for the assumption that aggressive behavior is interrelated with excessive gaming in general. Results of this study contribute to the assumption that also playing games without monetary reward meets criteria of addiction. Hence, an addictive potential of gaming should be taken into consideration regarding prevention and intervention.",doi,10.1089/cpb.2006.9956,anderson2010,CyberPsychology & Behavior,"Grusser, S.

,Expertise In Video Game Playing Is Associated With Reduced Valence-Concordant Emotional Expressivity,"In carefully selected groups of video game playing (VGP) experts and nonexperts, we examined valence-concordant emotional expressivity. We measured electromyographic (EMG) activity over the corrugator supercilii muscle while participants viewed pleasant, neutral, and unpleasant pictures. Potential group differences concerning valence-concordant expressivity may arise from differences concerning the participants' emotional reactivity. To control for such differences, we concomitantly measured skin conductance response (SCR) and, in a separate affect misattribution procedure (AMP), valence transfer from the same set of stimuli. Importantly, we found attenuated valence-concordant EMG activity over the corrugator supercilii muscle in VGP experts compared to nonexperts, but no differences were evident concerning SCR or valence transfer in the AMP. The findings suggest that expertise in VGP is particularly associated with reduced valence-concordant emotional expressivity. © 2014 Society for Psychophysiological Research.",doi,10.1111/psyp.12298,Scopus,Psychophysiology,"Weinreich A., Strobach T., Schubert T.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Explicit And Implicit Anti-Fat Attitudes In Children And Their Relationships With Their Body Images,"Objective: This study aimed to explore the prevalence of negative attitudes toward overweight peers among children using different explicit and implicit measures, and to analyze their relationships with some aspects of their body image. Method: A total of 120 children aged 6-11 years were interviewed using a computer program that simulated a game containing several tasks. Specifically, we have applied multiple measures of explicit attitudes toward average-weight/overweight peers, several personal body attitudes questions and a child-oriented version of the Implicit Association Test. Results: Our participants showed important prejudice and stereotypes against overweight children, both at the explicit and implicit levels. However, we found important differences in the intensity of prejudice and its developmental course as a function of the tasks and the type of measurement used to assess it. Conclusions: Children who grow up in Western societies idealize thinness from an early age and denigrate overweight, to which they associate explicitly and implicitly a series of negative traits that have nothing to do with the weight. As they grow older, they seem to reduce their levels of explicit prejudice, but not the intensity of implicit bias. More research is needed to study in depth prejudice and discrimination toward overweight children from a developmental point of view. Copyright © 2010 S.

,Exploring The Effects Of Videogame Play On Creativity Performance And Emotional Responses,"Abstract The effects of videogame play is a growing research field in the recent decades, however, little is known about how 'out-of-school' use of videogames influences creativity and emotions. This interdisciplinary study employed a within-participant design to explore the effects of two different types of online videogames (an action videogame and a non-action videogame) on subsequent creativity performance measured using an idea generation task and emotional responses. Results showed that after playing the action game participants performed higher on originality, elaboration and flexibility than after playing the non-action game, but not productivity. Furthermore, playing both types of game elicited positive emotion (i.e., pleasantness) high in approach motivation (i.e., desire). However, action video game play elicited higher arousal and stress than non-action videogame play. The current research suggests that the relationships between the quantity (productivity and flexibility) and the quality (in this paper, originality and elaboration) of creativity performance may be complex and emotional response of arousal might be a significant emotional factor which influences subsequent creativity performance after videogame play. The cognitive and emotional effects of videogames are discussed along with implications for future emotion-creativity-videogame research. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.chb.2015.07.024,Scopus,Computers in Human Behavior,Yeh C.S.-H.,2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Exploring The Use Of Computer Games And Virtual Reality In Exposure Therapy For Fear Of Driving Following A Motor Vehicle Accident.,"Specific phobia, situational type-driving, induced by accident (accident phobia) occurs in 18-38% of those involved in a vehicular accident of sufficient severity to warrant referral to the emergency departments of a general hospital. The objective is to investigate, in an open study, the effectiveness of the combined use of computer generated environments involving driving games (game reality [GR]) and a virtual reality (VR) driving environment in exposure therapy for the treatment of driving phobia following a motor vehicle accident (MVA) program. Fourteen subjects who met DSM-IV criteria for Simple Phobia/Accident Phobia and were referred from the emergency department of a general hospital were exposed to a Virtual Driving Environment (Hanyang University Driving Phobia Environment) and computer driving games (London Racer/Midtown Madness/Rally Championship). Patients who experienced ""immersion"" (i.e., a sense of presence with heightened anxiety) in one of the driving simulations (defined as an increase in SUD ratings of 3 and/or an increase of heart rate > 15 BPM in a 1-h trial session of computer simulation driving) were exposed to a cognitive behavioral program of up to 12 1-h sessions involving graded driving simulation tasks with self-monitoring, physiological feedback, diaphragmatic breathing and cognitive reappraisal. Subjects were assessed at the beginning and end of therapy with measurements of: physiological responsivity (heart rate), subjective ratings of distress (SUD), rating scales for severity of fear of driving (FDI), Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (CAPS) and depression (HAM-D) and achievement of target behaviors. Of all patients 7/14 (50%) became immersed in the driving environments. This immersed group (n = 7) completed the exposure program. Pre- and post-treatment comparisons showed significant post treatment reductions on all measures SUDS (p = 0.008), FDI (p = 0.008), CAPS (p = 0.008), HR (p = 0.008), CAPS (p = 0.008), HAM-D (p = 0.031). Further analysis of the FDI showed significant reductions in all three subscales: travel distress (p = 0.008), travel avoidance (p = 0.008), and maladaptive driving strategies (p = 0.016). The findings of this study suggest that VR and GR may have a useful role in the treatment of driving phobia post-accident even when co-morbid conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder and depression are present.",doi,10.1089/109493103322011641,pubmed,"Cyberpsychology &amp; behavior : the impact of the Internet, multimedia and virtual reality on behavior and society","Walshe, David G; Lewis, Elizabeth J; Kim, Sun I; O'Sullivan, Kathleen; Wiederhold, Brenda K",2003,NA,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,False And Miss Detections In Temporal Segmentation Of Tv Sports News Videos – Causes And Remedies,"Categorization of sports videos, i.e. the automatic recognition of sports disciplines in videos, mainly in TV sports news, is one of the most important process in content-based video indexing. It may be achieved using different strategies such as player scenes analyses leading to the detection of playing fields, recognition of superimposed text like player or team names, identification of player faces, detection of lines typical for a given playing field and for a given sports discipline, detection of sports objects specific for a given sports category, and also recognition of player and audience emotions. The sports video indexing usually starts with the automatic temporal segmentation. Unfortunately, it could happen that two or even more consecutive shots of two different sports events, although most frequently of the same sport discipline, are falsely identified as one shot. The strong similarity mainly of color of playing fields does not sometimes allow the detection of a video transition. On the other hand, very short shots of several frames are detected in case of dissolve effects or they are simply false detections. Most often it is due to very dynamic movements of players or a camera during the game, changes in advertising banners on playing fields, as well as due to light flashes. False as well as miss detections diminish the efficacy of the temporal aggregation method applied to video indexing. The chapter examines the cases of false and miss detections in temporal segmentation of TV sports news videos observed in the Automatic Video Indexer AVI. The causes and remedies of false and miss detections are discussed. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",doi,10.1007/978-3-319-10383-9_4,Scopus,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,Choroś K.,2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Family History Of Hypertension And Left Ventricular Mass In Youth: Possible Mediating Parameters,"Whether positive family history (FH) of essential hypertension (EH) in normotensive youth is associated with increased left ventricular mass (LVM) and hemodynamic, anthropometric, and demographic parameters previously associated with increased LVM in adults is unknown. To examine these issues, 323 healthy youth (mean age, 13.6 ± 1.3 years), 194 with positive FH of EH (61% African Americans, 39% whites) and 129 with negative FH of EH (33% African Americans, 67% whites) were evaluated. Hemodynamics were measured at rest and during four stressors (ie, postural change, car driving simulation, video game, forehead cold). Echocardiographic-derived measures of LVM were indexed separately to body surface area and height2.7. Controlling for age and race differences (ie, 74% of African Americans v 47% of whites had positive FH), the positive FH group exhibited greater LVM/height2.7, LVM/body surface area, higher systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressures (DBP), and total peripheral resistance index (TPRI) and lower cardiac index at rest (P &lt; .05 for all). The positive FH group also displayed higher peak SBP or DBP and higher TPRI increases to each stressor and came from lower socioeconomic status backgrounds (P &lt; .05 for all). Regression analyses indicated that FH of EH was not a significant determinant of LVM/height2.7 after accounting for contributions of gender (greater in men), general adiposity, resting cardiac index and blood pressure (BP), and TPRI responsivity to video game and cold stimulation (P &lt; .05 for all). Thus, greater LVM index in positive FH of EH youth appears in part related to their greater BP and TPRI at rest and during stress. © 2001 American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd.",doi,10.1016/S0895-7061(00)01275-9,Scopus,American Journal of Hypertension,"Cook B.B., Treiber F.A., Mensah G., Jindal M., Davis H.C., Kapuku G.K.",2001,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,"Feasibility And Efficacy Of An Mhealth Game For Managing Anxiety: ""Flowy"" Randomized Controlled Pilot Trial And Design Evaluation","Objective: Meeting the complex needs of patients with chronic common mental health disorders (CMHDs) may be the greatest challenge facing organized medical practice. On the basis of a well-established and proven theoretical foundation for controlled respiration as a behavioral intervention for CMHDs, as well as preliminary evidence that gamification can improve health outcomes through increasing patient engagement, this randomized controlled pilot study evaluated the feasibility and clinical efficacy of a mobile health game called ""Flowy"" (www.flowygame.com) that digitally delivered breathing retraining exercises for anxiety, panic, and hyperventilation symptom management. Materials and Methods: We designed an unblinded, Web-based, parallel-group randomized controlled trial focusing on feasibility, clinical efficacy, and design proof of concept. In the intervention condition (n = 31), participants received free access to ""Flowy"" for 4 weeks. In the control condition (n = 32), participants were placed on a waitlist for 4 weeks before being offered free access to ""Flowy."" Online measurements using psychological self-report questionnaires were made at 2 and 4 weeks post-baseline. Results: At trial conclusion, participants found ""Flowy"" acceptable as an anxiety management intervention. ""Flowy"" engaged participants sufficiently to endorse proactive gameplay. Intent-to-treat analysis revealed a reduction in anxiety, panic, and self-report hyperventilation scores in both trial arms, with the intervention arm experiencing greater quality of life. Participants perceived ""Flowy"" as a fun and useful intervention, proactively used ""Flowy"" as part of their care, and would recommend ""Flowy"" to family and friends. Conclusions: Our results suggest that a digital delivery of breathing retraining exercises through a mobile health game can manage anxiety, panic, and hyperventilation symptoms associated with CMHDs.

,"Feasibility, Design And Conduct Of A Pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trial To Reduce Overweight And Obesity In Children: The Electronic Games To Aid Motivation To Exercise (Egame) Study","Background: Childhood obesity has reached epidemic proportions in developed countries. Sedentary screen-based activities such as video gaming are thought to displace active behaviors and are independently associated with obesity. Active video games, where players physically interact with images onscreen, may have utility as a novel intervention to increase physical activity and improve body composition in children. The aim of the Electronic Games to Aid Motivation to Exercise (eGAME) study is to determine the effects of an active video game intervention over 6 months on: body mass index (BMI), percent body fat, waist circumference, cardio-respiratory fitness, and physical activity levels in overweight children. Methods/Design: Three hundred and thirty participants aged 10-14 years will be randomized to receive either an active video game upgrade package or to a control group (no intervention). Discussion: An overview of the eGAME study is presented, providing an example of a large, pragmatic randomized controlled trial in a community setting. Reflection is offered on key issues encountered during the course of the study. In particular, investigation into the feasibility of the proposed intervention, as well as robust testing of proposed study procedures is a critical step prior to implementation of a large-scale trial.

Further, it theorizes that media experience, along with individual differences in cognitive abilities, facilitates or prevents flow state in media users. Therefore, it is a balance between individual differences in cognitive abilities and media message challenges that explains enjoyment of media use. The authors offer the case of video game usage as an exemplar, and examples of cognitive tasks are provided and linked to game genre content.",doi,10.1111/j.1468-2885.2004.tb00318.x,nagy2015,Communication Theory,"Sherry, J.

,"Flux Variation In A Siberian Taiga Forest Near Yakutsk Estimated By A One-Dimensional Model With Routine Data, 1986-2000","For a larch forest site near Yakutsk, energy and water fluxes are estimated and their variations are investigated using a one-dimensional land surface model with daily routine data. The estimation period is 1986-2000, including the period before the start of tower observation (1997) on the left bank of the Lena River. The land surface model includes three submodels: vegetation, snow cover, and soil. The model can calculate water and energy fluxes above and within the forest if meteorological data over the forest are given as input. Data used in this study are Baseline Meteorological Data in Siberia (BMDS) Version 3. This set comprises daily data of main meteorological elements. The procedure is as follows: (1) preparation of equations between routine Yakutsk data and larch tower data; (2) estimation of past meteorological data over the taiga using those equations; and (3) estimation of fluxes using the one-dimensional model. The date of leaf-out start is parameterized with soil temperature and accumulated air temperature. It corresponds to the green-up time obtained from satellite normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data. Estimated monthly deviation of net radiation, Rn, is 10 Wm-2. Its maximum is 20 Wm-2. The monthly deviation of latent heat flux, LE, is less than 12 Wm-2. Its warm season average is less than 7 Wm-2. Although the magnitude of LE is almost zero in December and January, and several Wm-2 aside from these 2 months, the sensible heat flux, H, sometimes becomes negative during the cold season. The variation of evapotranspiration is considerably smaller than that of precipitation. The evapotranspiration (E) normalized by potential evaporation (Ep), E/Ep is 0.37-04 in the warm season; it tends to be large when leaf-out starts early. The amount of evapotranspiration in the warm season can be estimated from Ep within an error of 5 mm using this relationship.

,Fnirs Evidence Of Prefrontal Regulation Of Frustration In Early Childhood,"The experience of frustration is common in early childhood, yet some children seem to possess a lower tolerance for frustration than others. Characterizing the biological mechanisms underlying a wide range of frustration tolerance observed in early childhood may inform maladaptive behavior and psychopathology that is associated with this construct. The goal of this study was to measure prefrontal correlates of frustration in 3-5-year-old children, who are not readily adaptable for typical neuroimaging approaches, using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). fNIRS of frontal regions were measured as frustration was induced in children through a computer game where a desired and expected prize was ""stolen"" by an animated dog. A fNIRS general linear model (GLM) was used to quantify the correlation of brain regions with the task and identify areas that were statistically different between the winning and frustrating test conditions. A second-level voxel-based ANOVA analysis was then used to correlate the amplitude of each individual's brain activation with measure of parent-reported frustration. Experimental results indicated increased activity in the middle prefrontal cortex during winning of a desired prize, while lateral prefrontal cortex activity increased during frustration. Further, activity increase in lateral prefrontal cortex during frustration correlated positively with parent-reported frustration tolerance. These findings point to the role of the lateral prefrontal cortex as a potential region supporting the regulation of emotion during frustration. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",doi,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.04.057,Scopus,NeuroImage,"Perlman S.B., Luna B., Hein T.C., Huppert T.J.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Fostering 21St-Century Skills In Constructivist Engineering Classrooms With Digital Game-Based Learning,"Video games can be considered constructivist instructional materials because of their potential to promote student-centered opportunities in the classroom. Since the emergence of this educational trend, called digital game-based learning, several studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect that learning or recreational video games have had on learners and on their mastery of learning objectives. Many of these studies have focused on specific sets of skills that specific video games can promote. Nevertheless, there is evidence that any type of video game, regardless of its learning or recreational nature, can help students develop certain knowledge, skills, and attitudes (KSAs) that could be useful for engineering courses and projects. This evidence also suggests that digital game-based learning contributes to 21st-century skills that are necessary for competitive engineering professionals. This literature review will describe the KSAs that could be promoted in constructivist-oriented classrooms when learners engage in any type of video game. This research paper will focus on how engineering students can develop 21st-century KSAs that are implicit in each gaming opportunity, such as high-order thinking and decision-making skills, persistence, socialization, leadership skills, self-confidence, and autonomy and self-regulation. © 2013 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/RITA.2015.2452673,Scopus,Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje,"Nino M., Evans M.A.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,From Personalization To Parrhesia: A Multimodal Analysis Of Autobiographical Recalls In Barack Obama’s Political Speech,"This paper analyzes autobiographical recalls in Barack Obama’s political speech, framing them by two main theoretical perspectives rather than by the more commonly evoked theory of personalization. The first theoretical framework refers to Arendt’s concept of the self-aware pariah, as opposed to the concept of parvenu. The second theory invoked refers to the work of Michel Foucault on parrhesia, seen as a risky yet empowering communicative game. In accordance with these theoretical premises, four political speeches delivered by Barack Obama, both when he was still a “strange” incumbent and after he had become president of the USA, were selected, given the high political risks these particular speeches were addressing. Extracts sharing autobiographical memories were analyzed with both a multimodal analysis of communication and an analysis of facial expressions of emotions (facial action coding system, or FACS). Results show that these autobiographical memories conveyed parrhesiastic narratives about the social origins of Obama as a pariah. Together with these risky rhetorical moves, emotional expressions (mainly negative) were clearly evident, yet well regulated. Our concluding remarks on this first explorative analysis suggest that Obama could apply a parrhesiastic attitude to himself – making clear to all his socially disadvantaged origins – in order to persuade his audience to accept a similar parrhesiastic game for communicating about difficult aspects of the political situation of his listeners. The limitations of the study and possibilities for future developments of this line of research are discussed at the end of the chapter. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",doi,10.1007/978-3-319-14081-0_17,Scopus,Conflict and Multimodal Communication: Social Research and Machine Intelligence,"Leone G., Di Murro F., Serlupi Crescenzi L.",2015,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer2,Andreas

,"Full Of Sound And Fury, Signifying Something: The Impact Of Autonomic Arousal On Egm Gambling","An experiment was conducted to observe the influence of autonomic arousal on subsequent gambling behavior. Thirty-seven male and 32 female regular Electronic Gaming Machine (EGM) players were recruited through newspaper advertisements. Participants were randomly assigned to either: (1) a control condition, or (2) an experimental condition that introduced a loud white-noise event (80 db) at fixed 120 s intervals throughout the 5-min EGM gambling session. Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) measurements showed that the manipulation was successful in elevating autonomic arousal. The results showed differences in behavioral response to the manipulation based on prior experience with gambling problems. Persons with many gambling problems had lower average bet-sizes in the white-noise condition compared to the control, while those with few or no problems had higher average bet-sizes. The results suggest that arousal may provide different signals to gamblers with few versus many problems. Gamblers with many problems may interpret their arousal as a sign that they will soon lose money, while gamblers with few or no problems may associate feelings of arousal exclusively with winning. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.",doi,10.1007/s10899-007-9061-9,Scopus,Journal of Gambling Studies,"Rockloff M.J., Signal T., Dyer V.",2007,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Games And Recovery: The Use Of Video And Computer Games To Recuperate From Stress And Strain,"The use of video and computer games for recovery purposes was investigated in an online survey of 1614 participants. The data indicate that games are systematically used after exposure to stressful situations and strain, and that recovery experience is a significant facet of the gaming experience. Using structural equation modeling, the relationships among work-related fatigue, daily hassles, social support, coping style, recovery experience, and the use of video and computer games for recovery purposes were tested. Persons who associated stronger recovery experiences with game play used video and computer games more often after stressful and exhausting situations. In addition, participants' level of work-related fatigue and exposure to daily hassles were both positively associated with the use of games for recovery. Participants with emotion-focused coping style showed a higher tendency to use games for recovery than participants with problem-focused coping style. The relationship between work-related fatigue and game use for recovery purposes was moderated by social support. The stress buffering function of video and computer games was more important for participants receiving less social support. These participants showed a stronger relationship between work-related fatigue and the use of games for recovery than participants receiving more social support. © 2009 Hogrefe Publishing.",doi,10.1027/1864-1105.21.3.126,Scopus,Journal of Media Psychology,Reinecke L.,2009,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Gender Differences In Reward-Related Decision Processing Under Stress,"Recent research indicates gender differences in the impact of stress on decision behavior, but little is known about the brain mechanisms involved in these gender-specific stress effects. The current study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to determine whether induced stress resulted in gender-specific patterns of brain activation during a decision task involving monetary reward. Specifically, we manipulated physiological stress levels using a cold pressor task, prior to a risky decision making task. Healthy men (n = 24, 12 stressed) and women (n = 23, 11 stressed) completed the decision task after either cold pressor stress or a control task during the period of cortisol response to the cold pressor. Gender differences in behavior were present in stressed participants but not controls, such that stress led to greater reward collection and faster decision speed in males but less reward collection and slower decision speed in females. A gender-by-stress interaction was observed for the dorsal striatum and anterior insula. With cold stress, activation in these regions was increased in males but decreased in females. The findings of this study indicate that the impact of stress on reward-related decision processing differs depending on gender. © The Author (2011).

,"Gender Stereotypes, Aggression, And Computer Games: An Online Survey Of Women.","Computer games were conceptualized as a potential mode of entry into computer-related employment for women. Computer games contain increasing levels of realism and violence, as well as biased gender portrayals. It has been suggested that aggressive personality characteristics attract people to aggressive video games, and that more women do not play computer games because they are socialized to be non-aggressive. To explore gender identity and aggressive personality in the context of computers, an online survey was conducted on women who played computer games and women who used the computer but did not play computer games. Women who played computer games perceived their online environments as less friendly but experienced less sexual harassment online, were more aggressive themselves, and did not differ in gender identity, degree of sex role stereotyping, or acceptance of sexual violence when compared to women who used the computer but did not play video games. Finally, computer gaming was associated with decreased participation in computer-related employment; however, women with high masculine gender identities were more likely to use computers at work.",doi,10.1089/cpb.2004.7.714,anderson2010,CyberPsychology & Behavior,"Norris, K.

,Going Further In Affective Computing: How Emotion Recognition Can Improve Adaptive User Interaction,"This article joins the fields of emotion recognition and human computer interaction. While muchwork has been done on recognizing emotions, they are hardly used to improve a user’s interaction with a system. Although the fields of affective computing and especially serious games already make use of detected emotions, they tend to provide application and user specific adaptions only on the task level. We present an approach of utilizing recognized emotions to improve the interaction itself, independent of the underlying application at hand. Examining the state of the art in emotion recognition research and based on the architecture of Companion-System, a generic approach for determining the main cause of an emotion within the history of interactions is presented, allowing a specific reaction and adaption. Using such an approach could lead to systems that use emotions to improve not only the outcome of a task but the interaction itself in order to be truly individual and empathic. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",doi,10.1007/978-3-319-31056-5_6,Scopus,Intelligent Systems Reference Library,"Meudt S., Schmidt-Wack M., Honold F., Schüssel F., Weber M., Schwenker F., Palm G.",2016,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Gt-Cfs: A Game Theoretic Coalition Formulation Strategy For Reducing Power Loss In Micro Grids,"In recent years, research attention on smart grid comprising distributed power generators has increased. To produce electricity in the smart grid, many micro grids (MGs) may exploit various renewable energy resources. Because the production capacity of renewable resources cannot be controlled, the MGs often require the power plants to provide power for them. However, the power loss between each MG and the power plant is larger than that among the MGs. To alleviate this power loss, we propose a game theoretic coalition formulation strategy for the MGs dubbed GT-CFS. Our proposed GT-CFS allows the MGs (belonging to the same macro station (MS)) to autonomously cooperate and self-organize into a partition composed of disjoint MG coalitions. Also, GT-CFS enables the MGs, in a distributed manner, to decide whether they will remain in the coalitions or not upon environmental changes, e.g., the variation of the power demand of the MGs. Within every coalition, MGs coordinate the power transfer among themselves as well as with the MS, in a fashion to optimize a utility function, which captures the total losses over the power distribution lines. MGs in the same coalition will distribute the extra profits (i.e., payoff) produced from forming coalitions by their 'Shapley value.' Through computer simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed GT-CFS reduces the average power loss per MG significantly in contrast with the conventional noncooperative approach. © 2013 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TPDS.2013.178,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,"Wei C., Fadlullah Z.M., Kato N., Takeuchi A.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Guidelines For Sound Design In Computer Games,"The inconsequential exploitation of sound in most computer games, both in extent and nature, contrasts with its prominence in our daily lives and with the kind of associations that have been explored in domains such as music and cinema. Sound design remains the craft of a talented minority and the unavailability of a public body of knowledge on the subject has greatly contributed to this state of affairs. This leads to a mix of alienation and best-judgment improvisation in the broader development community. A sensitivity to the potential of sound for the enrichment of the experience-with emphasis on game specifics-is, therefore, necessary. This study presents a contribution to the practice of sound design for computer games. An approach to intentional sound design, informed by multi-disciplinary interpretations of concepts including emotion, context, acoustic ecology, soundscape, resonance, and entrainment, is distilled into a set of design guidelines that holistically address the different sound layers. © 2011, IGI Global.",doi,10.4018/978-1-61692-828-5.ch017,Scopus,Game Sound Technology and Player Interaction: Concepts and Developments,"Alves V., Roque L.",2010,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Habituation And Dishabituation Of Human Salivary Response,"Habituation may be relevant for understanding how sensory stimuli influence factors related to ingestive behavior. In the first of three experiments in humans we showed that salivation and hedonic ratings to lemon or lime juice habituated within 10 presentations, and dishabituation of the salivation and hedonic ratings to the original juice were observed after a new juice was presented. Experiment 2 replicated the habituation and decrease in hedonics to lemon juice, and showed both dishabituation and a relative increase in hedonics when chocolate taste, rather than another juice, served as the dishabituating stimulus. In a third experiment we showed a video game, a nontaste stimulus, could serve as a distractor to prevent the development of habituation, as well as a dishabituator after habituation had occurred. © 1992.",doi,10.1016/0031-9384(92)90075-D,Scopus,Physiology and Behavior,"Epstein L.H., Rodefer J.S., Wisniewski L., Caggiula A.R.",1992,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,"Health Outcomes Of Information System Use Lifestyles Among Adolescents: Videogame Addiction, Sleep Curtailment And Cardio-Metabolic Deficiencies","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Obesity is a rising problem among adolescents in modern societies; it results in long-term cardio-metabolic problems. Possible overlooked drivers of obesity and its consequent cardio-metabolic deficits include videogame addiction and the resulting curtailed sleep; both are growing problems among adolescents. The objective of this study is to examine possible associations among these concepts in adolescents, as a means to point to plausible interventions.METHODS: Data were collected from 94 adolescents who play videogames and are enrolled in outpatient clinics, using surveys, wearable sleep monitors (FitBit), physical exams, and blood tests at three points in time. These data were subjected to structural equation modeling (SEM) analyses and bootstrapping-based mediation testing procedures.RESULTS: Videogame addiction among adolescents was negatively associated with sleep duration (β = -0.24). Sleep duration was negatively associated with obesity (β = -0.30), which in turn was associated with elevated blood pressure (β = 0.26), low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (β = -0.18), high triglycerides (β = 0.61), and high insulin resistance (β = 0.39). The model explained 36.2% of the variation in sleep duration, 32.7% of the variation in obesity, and between 12.8% and 28.1% of the variation in cardio-metabolic indicators. Post-hoc analyses indicated that curtailed sleep is a possible full mediator of the association between videogame addiction, abdominal obesity and the associated cardio-metabolic deficits.CONCLUSION: The findings point to possible information systems use lifestyle-health links, which behooves researchers and practitioners to pay closer attention to possible adverse health outcomes of technology-related addictions. Interventions that target problematic video-gaming and sleep should be devised as a possible means for improving adolescents' long-term cardio-metabolic health.",doi,10.1371/journal.pone.0154764,Scopus,PloS one,"Turel O., Romashkin A., Morrison K.M.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,"Heart Rate And Oxygen Consumption During Mental Arithmetic, A Video Game, And Graded Static Exercise","Heart rate, oxygen consumption, and respiratory activity were recorded while 18 young male subjects performed a stressful mental arithmetic task and played a video game. Measurements were also taken while subjects undertook a graded static leg lifting exercise. Physiological activity increased as an orderly function of exercise workload. For each subject, heart rate was plotted against oxygen consumption over the various exercise loads. Knowing oxygen consumption during the psychological tasks, these regression equations allowed the prediction of heart rate, and thus the computation of “additional” heart rate as the difference between actual and predicted heart rate. Overall predicted heart rate values were significantly less than the values actually recorded during the psychological tasks. However, whereas mental arithmetic was associated with “additional” heart rates of the same order as those observed in earlier research using graded dynamic exercise, the video game elicited decidedly less “additional” heart rate in the present case. The explanation for this lay in the regression lines; static exercise was characterized by heart rate‐oxygen consumption regressions which were much steeper in terms of slope, as well as somewhat lower in terms of intercept, than those observed with graded dynamic exercise.

,Heart Rate Reactivity To Laboratory Tasks And Ambulatory Heart Rate In Daily Life,"This study investigated relationships between laboratory task-related heart rate reactivity and ambulatory heart rate responses and variability during daily life. Sixty-two healthy, young men completed one laboratory session consisting of pretask rest, reaction time, video game, and mental arithmetic, and one 24-hour ambulatory heart rate monitoring day. After controlling for ambulatory physical activity, laboratory reactivity measured as basal-to-task increase correlated significantly with ambulatory minimum, mean, and maximum increases from basal during wakefulness and with awake mean square successive difference. After controlling for ambulatory physical activity, laboratory reactivity measured as pretask-to-task increase correlated significantly only with awake mean square successive difference. These results support the hypothesis that individual differences in heart rate responses to laboratory tasks reflect similar differences in heart rate responses and variability during daily life. Results are compared in their degree of support for two theoretical models describing the generalization of individual differences in laboratory reactivity to reactivity during daily life.",doi,10.1097/00006842-199101000-00003,Scopus,Psychosomatic Medicine,Pollak M.H.,1991,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas

The main purpose of the study was to demonstrate that the expression of heart rate reactivity during daily life depends on the nature of the daily life situation, or on subjective or behavioral responses in the daily life situation. Twenty-six healthy, male medical students completed one laboratory session consisting of pretask rest, reaction time, video game, and mental arithmetic conditions, and 2 day-long field study periods, during which subjects either worked as student physicians in a medical clinic or attended classroom lectures. After controlling for differences in daily life physical activity levels, (1) heart rate levels were significantly higher during clinic work periods, compared to classroom work periods and evenings of both days, (2) and heart rate responses to the tasks correlated significantly with minimum, mean, and maximum heart rate responses from the clinic work period, but not from the other field periods. Thus, individual differences in heart rate reactivity were found in one daily life situation, but not in another daily life situation. These results support the experimental hypothesis.",doi,10.1097/00006842-199405000-00015,Scopus,Psychosomatic Medicine,Pollak M.H.,1994,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Hemispheric Consequences Of Success-Related Emotional States: Roles Of Arousal And Attention,"Three experiments employed a video game technique to investigate the influence of success-related emotional states on the detection of lateralized visual targets. Emotion was manipulated by means of success and failure feedback, while central and peripheral pretarget cues were used to assess arousal and attentional processes. Under neutral conditions involving no feedback, subjects showed a right visual field (RVF) advantage along with a phasic alerting effect (i.e., reaction times were faster to targets following cues at intermediate stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs)). When emotional value was added to the task, the RVF advantage increased following failure and decreased following success feedback. This effect peaked at intermediate SOAs, corresponding with the buildup of phasic arousal initiated by the cues. It was not influenced by the location of the pretarget cues, suggesting that attentional processes are not directly involved. These results are discussed in terms of recent models of hemispheric functioning during positive and negative emotional states. © 1989.",doi,10.1016/0278-2626(89)90021-3,Scopus,Brain and Cognition,Derryberry D.,1989,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,High Blood Pressure And Sedentary Behavior In Adolescents Are Associated Even After Controlling For Confounding Factors,"Objective. The aim of this study was to determine whether high blood pressure (HBP) is associated with sedentary behavior in young people even after controlling for potential confounders (gender, age, socioeconomic level, tobacco, alcohol, obesity and physical activity). Methods. In this epidemiological study, 1231 adolescents were evaluated. Blood pressure was measured with an oscillometric device and waist circumference with an inextensible tape. Sedentary behavior (watching television, computer use and playing video games) and physical activity were assessed by a questionnaire. We used mean and standard deviation to describe the statistical analysis, and the association between HBP and sedentary behavior was assessed by the chi-squared test. Binary logistic regression was used to observe the magnitude of association and cluster analyses (sedentary behavior and abdominal obesity; sedentary behavior and physical inactivity). Results. HBP was associated with sedentary behaviors [odds ratio (OR) = 2.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.41-3.96], even after controlling for various confounders (OR = 1.68, CI = 1.03-2.75). In cluster analysis the combination of sedentary behavior and elevated abdominal obesity contributed significantly to an increased likelihood of having HBP (OR = 13.51, CI 7.21-23.97). Conclusions. Sedentary behavior was associated with HBP, and excess fat in the abdominal region contributed to the modulation of this association. © 2015 Scandinavian Foundation for Cardiovascular Research.",doi,10.3109/08037051.2015.1070475,Scopus,Blood Pressure,"Christofaro D.G.D., De Andrade S.M., Cardoso J.R., Mesas A.E., Codogno J.S., Fernandes R.A.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,"High Versus Low Aggressive Priming During Video Game Training: Effects On Violent Action During Game Play, Hostility, Heart Rate, And Blood Pressure.","Playing violent video games is related to increased negative affect and cardiovascular reactivity. We examined the influence of high and low aggressive priming during video-game training on violence during game play (e.g., shooting, choking), hostility, frustration with game play, blood pressure, and heart rate. Male undergraduates (N= 36) were assigned to a high aggressive or low aggressive video-game priming condition. After training, they played Metal Gear Solid(tm), which allows players to advance by using stealth, violence, or both. Participants in the high aggressive priming condition used significantly more violent action during game play and reported more hostility than those in the low aggressive priming condition. Heart rate was correlated with feelings of hostility. These findings indicate that both aggressive priming and use of game violence influence arousal and negative affect and might increase behavioral aggression.",doi,10.1111/j.1559-1816.2002.tb02751.x,anderson2010,Journal of Applied Social Psychology,"Panee, C.

,Human Behavior Analysis For Highlight Ranking In Broadcast Racket Sports Video,"The majority of existing work on sports video analysis concentrates on highlight extraction. Little work focuses on the important issue as how the extracted highlights should be organized. In this paper, we present a multimodal approach to organize the highlights extracted from racket sports video grounded on human behavior analysis using a nonlinear affective ranking model. Two research challenges of highlight ranking are addressed, namely affective feature extraction and ranking model construction. The basic principle of affective feature extraction in our work is to extract sensitive features which can stimulate user's emotion. Since the users pay most attention to player behavior and audience response in racket sport highlights, we extract affective features from player behavior including action and trajectory, and game-specific audio keywords. We propose a novel motion analysis method to recognize the player actions. We employ support vector regression to construct the nonlinear highlight ranking model from affective features. A new subjective evaluation criterion is proposed to guide the model construction. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approaches, we have tested them on more than ten-hour broadcast tennis and badminton videos. The experimental results demonstrate that our action recognition approach significantly outperforms the existing appearance-based method. Moreover, our user study shows that the affective highlight ranking approach is effective. © 2007 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TMM.2007.902847,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Multimedia,"Zhu G., Huang Q., Xu C., Xing L., Gao W., Yao H.",2007,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,I Wish I Were A Warrior: The Role Of Wishful Identification In The Effects Of Violent Video Games On Aggression In Adolescent Boys.,"This study tested the hypothesis that violent video games are especially likely to increase aggression when players identify with violent game characters. Dutch adolescent boys with low education ability (N=112) were randomly assigned to play a realistic or fantasy violent or nonviolent video game. Next, they competed with an ostensible partner on a reaction time task in which the winner could blast the loser with loud noise through headphones (the aggression measure). Participants were told that high noise levels could cause permanent hearing damage. Habitual video game exposure, trait aggressiveness, and sensation seeking were controlled for. As expected, the most aggressive participants were those who played a violent game and wished they were like a violent character in the game. These participants used noise levels loud enough to cause permanent hearing damage to their partners, even though their partners had not provoked them. These results show that identifying with violent video game characters makes players more aggressive. Players were especially likely to identify with violent characters in realistic games and with games they felt immersed in.

,Immersive Journalism: Immersive Virtual Reality For The First-Person Experience Of News,"This paper introduces the concept and discusses the implications of immersive journalism, which is the production of news in a form in which people can gain firstperson experiences of the events or situation described in news stories. The fundamental idea of immersive journalism is to allow the participant, typically represented as a digital avatar, to actually enter a virtually recreated scenario representing the news story. The sense of presence obtained through an immersive system (whether a Cave or head-tracked head-mounted displays [HMD] and online virtual worlds, such as video games and online virtual worlds) affords the participant unprecedented access to the sights and sounds, and possibly feelings and emotions, that accompany the news. This paper surveys current approaches to immersive journalism and the theoretical background supporting claims regarding avatar experience in immersive systems. We also provide a specific demonstration: Giving participants the experience of being in an interrogation room in an offshore prison. By both describing current approaches and demonstrating an immersive journalism experience, we open a new avenue for research into how presence can be utilized in the field of news and nonfiction. © 2010 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",doi,10.1162/PRES_a_00005,Scopus,Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments,"de la Peña N., Weil P., Llobera J., Giannopoulos E., Pomés A., Spanlang B., Friedman D., Sanchez-Vives M.V., Slater M.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas

This pilot study aimed to assess whether VG influences glycemic balance in children with type 1 diabetes. Twelve children with type 1 diabetes were subjected to two distinct tests at a few weeks interval: (i) a 60-min VG session followed by a 60-min rest period and (ii) a 60-min reading session followed by a 60-min rest period. Heart rate, blood pressure, glycemia, epinephrine (E), norepinephrine (NE), cortisol (F), and growth hormone (GH) were measured at 30 min intervals from -60 to +120 min. Non-parametric Wilcoxon tests for paired data were performed on Δ-values computed from baseline (0 min). Rise in heart rate (p = 0.05) and NE increase (p = 0.03) were shown to be significantly higher during the VG session when compared to the reading session and a significant difference of Δ-glycemic values was measured between the respective rest periods. This pilot study suggests that VG playing could induce a state of excitation sufficient to activate the sympathetic system and alter the course of glycemia. Dietary and insulin dose recommendations may be needed to better control glycemic excursion in children playing VG. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.",doi,10.1111/j.1399-5448.2011.00770.x,Scopus,Pediatric Diabetes,"Phan-Hug F., Thurneysen E., Theintz G., Ruffieux C., Grouzmann E.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Improved Metabolic And Cardiorespiratory Fitness During A Recreational Training Program In Obese Children,"Physical activity may protect from the adverse effects of obesity. In obese children, an increased adherence and a decreased drop-out rate during exercise could be achieved with adaptated activities. We studied a recreational 12-week controlled training program for sedentary obese children, including interactive video games. We enrolled 22 obese subjects (13.23±1.76 years) in an exercise program, implemented twice a week for a 12-week period. The program consisted of a combination of circuit-based aerobics, strength and resistance exercises; specifically soccer, rugby, volleyball and basketball and interactive video game exercises. Outcome measurements included body composition, metabolic profile and cardiorespiratory fitness. During the 12-week training program there was a significant decrease in body mass index (BMI) (p=0.002), SDS-BMI (p=0.003), waist circumference (p=0.004), waist circumference/height ratio (p=0.001),% fat mass (p=0.001), blood glucose (p=0.001), homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (p=0.04), triglycerides (p=0.03) and systolic pressure (p=0.04) before and after exercise. Improvement in estimated maximum oxygen consumption (VO 2max ) (p &lt; 0.001) correlated with a decrease in fat mass (p=0.01), triglycerides (p=0.04) and insulin resistance (p=0.02). Exercise improved metabolic and cardiorespiratory fitness in obese children. Exercise training does not necessarily need to be vigorous, recreational programs are also effective and may encourage children to participate in physical activity and limit initial drop-out.",doi,10.1515/jpem-2012-0157,Scopus,Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology and Metabolism,"Calcaterra V., Larizza D., Codrons E., De Silvestri A., Brambilla P., Abela S., Arpesella M., Vandoni M.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,In-Class Active Video Game Supplementation And Adherence To Cardiac Rehabilitation,"Purpose: The application of active video games (AVGs) during cardiac rehabilitation (CR) sessions could potentially facilitate patient adherence. The feasibility, safety, and efficacy of in-class AVG supplementation as an alternative to conventional phase 2 programs were investigated. Methods: A pilot, evaluator-blinded, intention-to-treat, randomized controlled trial recruited 32 low-moderate risk CR participants and allocated them to conventional or AVG-supplemented exercise. Both groups experienced equal exercise loads for 6 weeks. Patients were assessed at baseline, end of the program, and after an 8-week followup. Adherence and safety-related outcomes were the primary endpoints. Secondary outcomes included change in exercise capacity, daily physical activity (PA), energy expenditure (EE), and psychometric profiling. Results: Patients (males 81%; 60 ± 10 years) presented with typical cardiovascular risk factors and similar baseline characteristics. Participants did not perceive an increased risk of injury and were more interactive. At the end of the program, there was a lower tendency for dropping out (6% vs 19%, P >.05), a significant improvement in PA (322 vs 247 arbitrary acceleration units/min, P =.047) and related EE per body weight (13 vs 11 kcal/kg/d, P =.04) among AVG participants compared with controls. No significant differences between groups for adverse medical events, exercise capacity, affect toward exercise, anxiety, depression, or quality-of-life changes were reported. Conclusions: The additional use of AVGs during CR sessions is feasible, safe, and significantly improved daily PA and EE. A dropout reduction trend among its users, which needs to be confirmed in a larger trial, raises awareness to AVG supplementation as a promising strategy to increase CR adherence.

,In A Working Mood?: The Effects Of Mood Management Processes On Subsequent Cognitive Performance,"This quasi-experimental study examined the effects of exposure to a computer game on arousal and subsequent task performance. After inducing a state of low arousal, participants were assigned to experimental or control conditions via self-selection. Members of the experimental group played a computer game for five minutes; subjects in the control group spent the same amount of time awaiting further instructions. Participants who were exposed to the computer game showed significantly higher levels of arousal and performed significantly better on a subsequent cognitive task. The pattern of results was not influenced by the participants' prior experience with the game. The findings indicate that mood-management processes associated with personal media use at the workplace go beyond the alteration of arousal and affect subsequent cognitive performance. © 2008 Hogrefe & Huber Publishers.",doi,10.1027/1864-1105.20.1.3,Scopus,Journal of Media Psychology,"Reinecke L., Trepte S.",2008,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Increased Reward In Ankle Robotics Training Enhances Motor Control And Cortical Efficiency In Stroke,"Robotics is rapidly emerging as a viable approach to enhance motor recovery after disabling stroke. Current principles of cognitive motor learning recognize a positive relationship between reward and motor learning. Yet no prior studies have established explicitly whether reward improves the rate or efficacy of robotics-assisted rehabilitation or produces neurophysiologic adaptations associated with motor learning. We conducted a 3 wk, 9-session clinical pilot with 10 people with chronic hemiparetic stroke, randomly assigned to train with an impedance- controlled ankle robot (anklebot) under either high reward (HR) or low reward conditions. The 1 h training sessions entailed playing a seated video game by moving the paretic ankle to hit moving onscreen targets with the anklebot only providing assistance as needed. Assessments included paretic ankle motor control, learning curves, electroencephalograpy (EEG) coherence and spectral power during unassisted trials, and gait function. While both groups exhibited changes in EEG, the HR group had faster learning curves (p = 0.05), smoother movements (p </= 0.05), reduced contralesional-frontoparietal coherence (p </= 0.05), and reduced left-temporal spectral power (p </= 0.05). Gait analyses revealed an increase in nonparetic step length (p = 0.05) in the HR group only. These results suggest that combining explicit rewards with novel anklebot training may accelerate motor learning for restoring mobility.",doi,10.1682/JRRD.2013.02.0050,Scopus,Journal of Rehabilitation Research and Development,"Goodman R.N., Rietschel J.C., Roy A., Jung B.C., Diaz J., Macko R.F., Forrester L.W.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,"Individual Differences In Motives, Preferences, And Pathology In Video Games: The Gaming Attitudes, Motives, And Experiences Scales (Games)","A new measure of individual habits and preferences in video game use is developed in order to better study the risk factors of pathological game use (i.e., excessively frequent or prolonged use, sometimes called ""game addiction""). This measure was distributed to internet message boards for game enthusiasts and to college undergraduates. An exploratory factor analysis identified 9 factors: Story, Violent Catharsis, Violent Reward, Social Interaction, Escapism, Loss-Sensitivity, Customization, Grinding, and Autonomy. These factors demonstrated excellent fit in a subsequent confirmatory factor analysis, and, importantly, were found to reliably discriminate between inter-individual game preferences (e.g., Super Mario Brothers as compared to Call of Duty). Moreover, three factors were significantly related to pathological game use: the use of games to escape daily life, the use of games as a social outlet, and positive attitudes toward the steady accumulation of in-game rewards. The current research identifies individual preferences and motives relevant to understanding video game players' evaluations of different games and risk factors for pathological video game use. © 2013 Hilgard, Engelhardt and Bartholow.",doi,10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00608,Scopus,Frontiers in Psychology,"Hilgard J., Engelhardt C.R., Bartholow B.D.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Influence Of Experience Level On Physical Activity During Interactive Video Gaming,"Background: The ability of interactive video games (IVGs) to individualize physical demands influences their viability as a physical activity option. This study examined the influence of experience level on activity levels and affect resulting from playing a martial arts IVG. Methods: Twenty participants completed 3 15-minute trials: (1) walking, (2) IVG with no previous experience (INEXP), and (3) IVG activity after 2 hours of practice (EXP) during which heart rate (HR), step counts, metabolic equivalents of task (METs), ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), session RPE, and affect (positive/negative affect, enjoyment) were measured. Results: Mean HR was lower during walking (107 ± 18 bpm) than during INEXP (131 ± 25 bpm) and EXP (120 ± 20 bpm). Peak HR and session RPE were lower for walking than for INEXP and EXP. No difference in mean HR was observed between IVG conditions, but peak HR and session RPE were lower for EXP than for INEXP. Walking resulted in greater postactivity reduction of negative affect; however, the IVG conditions were perceived as more enjoyable. Conclusions: Although the current IVG provided a greater exercise stimulus than walking, results suggest that user movements become more efficient with greater IVG experience and that exercise outcomes may decrease as a result. © 2015 Human Kinetics, Inc.",doi,10.1123/jpah.2014-0089,Scopus,Journal of Physical Activity and Health,"Kraft J.A., Russell W.D., Clark N., Helm J., Jackson A.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas

,Integrating Health Behavior Theory And Design Elements In Serious Games.,"Internet interventions for improving health and well-being have the potential to reach many people and fill gaps in service provision. Serious gaming interfaces provide opportunities to optimize user adherence and impact. Health interventions based in theory and evidence and tailored to psychological constructs have been found to be more effective to promote behavior change. Defining the design elements which engage users and help them to meet their goals can contribute to better informed serious games. To elucidate design elements important in SPARX, a serious game for adolescents with depression, from a user-centered perspective. We proposed a model based on an established theory of health behavior change and practical features of serious game design to organize ideas and rationale. We analyzed data from 5 studies comprising a total of 22 focus groups and 66 semistructured interviews conducted with youth and families in New Zealand and Australia who had viewed or used SPARX. User perceptions of the game were applied to this framework. A coherent framework was established using the three constructs of self-determination theory (SDT), autonomy, competence, and relatedness, to organize user perceptions and design elements within four areas important in design: computer game, accessibility, working alliance, and learning in immersion. User perceptions mapped well to the framework, which may assist developers in understanding the context of user needs. By mapping these elements against the constructs of SDT, we were able to propose a sound theoretical base for the model. This study's method allowed for the articulation of design elements in a serious game from a user-centered perspective within a coherent overarching framework. The framework can be used to deliberately incorporate serious game design elements that support a user's sense of autonomy, competence, and relatedness, key constructs which have been found to mediate motivation at all stages of the change process. The resulting model introduces promising avenues for future exploration. Involving users in program design remains an imperative if serious games are to be fit for purpose.",doi,10.2196/mental.4133,pubmed,JMIR mental health,"Cheek, Colleen; Fleming, Theresa; Lucassen, Mathijs Fg; Bridgman, Heather; Stasiak, Karolina; Shepherd, Matthew; Orpin, Peter",2015,NA,NA,reviewer2,Andreas

,Interactive Video Dance Games For Healthy Older Adults,"Background: Physical activity promotes health in older adults but participation rates are low. Interactive video dance games can increase activity in young persons but have not been designed for use with older adults. The purpose of this research was to evaluate healthy older adults' interest and participation in a dance game adapted for an older user. Methods: Healthy older adults were recruited from 3 senior living settings and offered three months of training and supervision using a video dance game designed for older people. Before and after the program, data was collected on vital signs, physical function and self reported quality of life. Feedback was obtained during and after training. Results: Of 36 persons who entered (mean age 80.1 + 5.4 years, 83 % female), 25 completed the study. Completers were healthier than noncompleters. Completers showed gains in narrow walk time, self-reported balance confidence and mental health.

,Intrinsic Motivation And Introspection In Reinforcement Learning,"Incorporating intrinsic motivation with reinforcement learning can permit agents to independently choose, which skills they will develop, or to change their focus of attention to learn different skills at different times. This implies an autonomous developmental process for skills in which a skill-acquisition goal is first identified, then a skill is learned to solve the goal. The learned skill may then be stored, reused, temporarily ignored or even permanently erased. This paper formalizes the developmental process for skills by proposing a goal-lifecycle using the option framework for motivated reinforcement learning agents. The paper shows how the goal-lifecycle can be used as a basis for designing motivational state-spaces that permit agents to reason introspectively and autonomously about when to learn skills to solve goals, when to activate skills, when to suspend activation of skills or when to delete skills. An algorithm is presented that simultaneously learns: 1) an introspective policy mapping motivational states to decisions that change the agent's motivational state, and 2) multiple option policies mapping sensed states and actions to achieve various domain-specific goals. Two variations of agents using this model are compared to motivated reinforcement learning agents without introspection for controlling non-player characters in a computer game scenario. Results show that agents using introspection can focus their attention on learning more complex skills than agents without introspection. In addition, they can learn these skills more effectively. © 2009-2011 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TAMD.2012.2208457,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Autonomous Mental Development,Merrick K.E.,2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Investigation Of Frontal Lobe Activation With Fnirs And Systemic Changes During Video Gaming.,"Frontal lobe activation caused by tasks such as videogames can be investigated using multichannel near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), sometimes called optical topography. The aims of this study are to investigate the effects of video gaming (fighting and puzzle games) in the brain and the systemic physiology and to determine whether systemic responses during the gaming task are associated with the measurement of localised cerebral haemodynamic changes as measured by fNIRS. We used a continuous-wave 8-channel fNIRS system to measure the changes in concentration of oxy-haemoglobin (HbO2) and deoxy-haemoglobin (HHb) and changes in total haemoglobin (ΔtHb = ΔHbO2 + ΔHHb) over the frontal lobe in 30 healthy volunteers. The Portapres system was used to measure mean blood pressure (MBP) and heart rate (HR), and a laser Doppler was employed to measure the changes in scalp blood flow (or flux). Even though we observed significant changes in systemic variables during gaming, in particular in scalp flow, we also managed to see localised activation patterns over the frontal polar (FP1) region. However, in some channels over the frontal lobe, we also observed significant correlations between the HbO2 and systemic variables.",doi,10.1007/978-1-4614-7411-1_13,pubmed,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,"Tachtsidis, Ilias; Papaioannou, Antonis",2014,NA,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,"Investigation Of The Relationship Between Social Isolation, Self-Esteem, Aggression And Computer Game Play In Japanese Adolescents.","Some support for expressed concern over the negative consequences of computer game play was obtained by Colwell and Payne (2000) in a questionnaire survey of UK adolescents. A second study was carried out in Tokyo, Japan, to test for generality of findings. There was strong evidence of similarity in relation to play patterns, but in contrast to the UK sample, number of good friends and self-esteem did not relate to game play. A principal components analysis of a scale to measure needs met by game play resulted in the same two previously obtained factors; ‘companionship’ and ‘prefer to friends’. However, in contrast to the UK sample, ‘companionship’ did not relate to play. A positive relation between the ‘prefer to friends’ factor and play was obtained for both boys and girls (boys only in the UK), thus providing support for the ‘electronic friendship’ hypothesis. There was evidence of a positive relation between play and aggression, but a preference for aggressive games was associated with lower aggression scores, and this raises questions for the ‘causal hypothesis’.",doi,10.1111/1467-839X.t01-1-00017,anderson2010,Asian Journal of Social Psychology,"Colwell, J., Kato, M.",2003,NA,NA,reviewer2,Andreas

The parents are unsurprisingly nervous though the child is relatively calm. You introduce yourself to the child who shakes your hand but then immediately goes back to his game, pausing briefly first to cough up a tissue full of phlegm. The parents explain to you that he had a recent bronchial infection (on day 5 of 7 of antibiotics) that is now just resolving but is, unfortunately, par for the course. The patient is very compliant with his inhaler use. The parents are just as concerned as you about the increased pulmonary risks associated with general endotracheal anesthesia and recent lower respiratory infection, especially in light of his cystic fibrosis; however, this surgery has been cancelled twice already, and their son never seems to have a clear window to have the procedure done. In addition, the mass is deep and painful to lie on, and the surgeon states it cannot be done under local anesthesia.

,"Kinematics, Dynamics, Biomechanics: Evolution Of Autonomy In Game Animation","The believeable portrayal of character performances is critical in engaging the immersed player in interactive entertainment. The story, the emotion and the relationship between the player and the world they are interacting within are hugely dependent on how appropriately the world's characters look, move and behave. We're concerned here with the character's motion; with next generation game consoles like Xbox360TM and Playstation®3 the graphical representation of characters will take a major step forward which places even more emphasis on the motion of the character. The behavior of the character is driven by story and design which are adapted to game context by the game's AI system. The motion of the characters populating the game's world, however, is evolving to an interesting blend of kinematics, dynamics, biomechanics and AI drivenmotion planning. Our goal here is to present the technologies involved in creating what are essentially character automata, emotionless and largely brainless character shells that nevertheless exhibit enough ""behavior"" to move as directed while adapting to the environment through sensing and actuating responses. This abstracts the complexities of low level motion control, dynamics, collision detection etc. and allows the game's artificial intelligence system to direct these characters at a higher level. While much research has already been conducted in this area and some great results have been published, we will present the particular issues that face game developers working on current and next generation consoles, and how these technologies may be integrated into game production pipelines so to facilitate the creation of character performances in games. The challenges posed by the limited memory and CPU bandwidth (though this is changing somewhat with next generation) and the challenges of integrating these solutions with current game design approaches leads to some interesting problems, some of which the industry has solutions for and some others which still remain largely unsolved. © The Eurographics Association and Blackwell Publishing 2005.",doi,10.1111/j.1467-8659.2005.00847.x,Scopus,Computer Graphics Forum,Collins S.,2005,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Lack Of Independent Relationships Between Left Ventricular Mass And Cardiovascular Reactivity To Physical And Psychological Stress In The Coronary Artery Risk Development In Young Adults (Cardia) Study,"The objective of this study was to determine whether exaggerated blood pressure (BP) reactivity to stress and psychosocial characteristics are related to left ventricular mass (LVM) in a large cohort of young adults. Analyses were conducted with 3,742 participants of the CARDIA study (945 white men, 1,024 white women, 781 black men, and 992 black women), evaluated in 1990 to 1091 with echocardiographic measurement of LVM. Analyses were stratified by gender and race. The relationships of LVM/height27 and cardiovascular reactivity to physical and psychological stressors (treadmill exercise, cold presser, video game, and star-tracing tasks), were examined in both univariate and multivariate analyses adjusting for baseline BP, weight, and other relevant biobehavioral variables. The relationships between LVM and several psychosocial characteristics (hostility, anger suppression, anxiety, depressive symptoms, and education) were also assessed. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) reactivity to exercise was significantly related to LVM in black and white men; LVM was 10% greater among white men with exaggerated (upper quintile) peak exercise SBP than among other white men. SBP reactivity to the cold presser test was related to LVM in all race/gender groups, although the relationship remained significant only among white men and women in the multivariate analysis. Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) reactivity to the video game was related to LVM only among black men in adjusted analyses. After adjusting for resting BP, weight, and other covariates in linear multiple regression models, SBP reactivity to exercise explained only 3% of the variance in LVM among white men. Otherwise, reactivity to other stressors or psychosocial variables accounted for no more than 1% of the variance in LVM. It was concluded that among a cohort of young adults, blood pressure reactivity to physical and mental stressors did not add substantially to the prediction of LVM when resting BP, weight, and other covariates were taken into account.",doi,10.1016/S0895-7061(96)00149-5,Scopus,American Journal of Hypertension,"Markovitz J.H., Raczynski J.M., Lewis C.E., Flack J., Chesney M., Chettur V., Hardin J.M., Johnson E.",1996,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas

,Lean Adolescents Achieve Higher Intensities But Not Higher Energy Expenditure While Playing Active Video Games Compared With Obese Ones,"Background While decreased physical activity and increased sedentary behaviours are incriminated for their role in the progression of obesity, active video games (AVG) may offer a new alternative to increase energy expenditure in youth. This study is the first to examine the effect of a 1-h AVG play on lean and obese adolescents' energy expenditure. Methods Body composition and aerobic fitness were assessed in 19 obese and 12 lean adolescent boys (12-15 years old). Participants performed a 1-h AVG session (Kinect Sports technology) while wearing a portable indirect calorimeter (K4b2) to assess their energy expenditure and heart rate. Results Body weight (91.0 ± 9.5 vs. 58.5 ± 12.4 kg), body mass index (32.2 ± 3.1 vs. 20.3 ± 1.6 kg m-2) and body fat (38.1 ± 2.7 vs. 13.4 ± 3.9%) were significantly higher in obese adolescents (P &lt; 0.001). Absolute energy expenditure was significantly higher in obese (P &lt; 0.05) but not when corrected for body composition. Maximal heart rate reached during AVG was significantly higher in lean adolescents (190 ± 25 vs. 183 ± 28 bpm, P &lt; 0.05). Time spent between 3 and 6 METs (Metabolic Equivalent Task) was not different between groups but time spent above 6 METs was higher in lean adolescents (P &lt; 0.05).

,Learning Basic Surgical Skills Through Simulator Training,"Computer-based surgical training simulators are instrumental in skill-based training and performance measurement. However, to date, the educational employment of these tools lacks empirically founded insights and effective practical guidelines. This study examined surgical residents during computer-based simulator training of basic laparoscopic surgical skills. The quantitative analysis of residents' performance averages from training onset to completion produced mixed results, revealing skill improvements as well as decreases, depending on the parameter. The results obtained from the simulator parameters and questionnaires showed that residents with either prior laparoscopic experience or gaming experience significantly outperformed their colleagues. Based on feedback and video-recorded performance analysis, the study concluded that autonomous training with the simulator is not sufficient for developing a minimum standard of performance. Residents need an adequate level of content-based feedback and supervisor support during training. We advise a more detailed and pedagogically informative measurement and feedback system, including specialist-instructor guidance, be developed. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",doi,10.1007/s11251-012-9217-6,Scopus,Instructional Science,"Silvennoinen M., Helfenstein S., Ruoranen M., Saariluoma P.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Learning To Win By Reading Manuals In A Monte-Carlo Framework,"Domain knowledge is crucial for e ective performance in autonomous control systems. Typically, human e ort is required to encode this knowledge into a control algorithm. In this paper, we present an approach to language grounding which automatically interprets text in the context of a complex control application, such as a game, and uses domain knowledge extracted from the text to improve control performance. Both text analysis and control strategies are learned jointly using only a feedback signal inherent to the application. To e ectively leverage textual information, our method automatically extracts the text segment most relevant to the current game state, and labels it with a task-centric predicate structure. This labeled text is then used to bias an action selection policy for the game, guiding it towards promising regions of the action space. We encode our model for text analysis and game playing in a multi-layer neural network, representing linguistic decisions via latent variables in the hidden layers, and game action quality via the output layer. Operating within the Monte-Carlo Search framework, we estimate model parameters using feedback from simulated games. We apply our approach to the complex strategy game Civilization II using the ocial game manual as the text guide. Our results show that a linguistically-informed game-playing agent signicantly outperforms its language-unaware counterpart, yielding a 34% absolute improvement and winning over 65% of games when playing against the built-in AI of Civilization. © 2012 AI Access Foundation.",doi,10.1613/jair.3560,Scopus,Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research,"Branavan S.R.K., Silver D., Barzilay R.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas

Subjects (n = 4,000) were embedded in networks (n = 230) of 20 nodes, to which we sometimes added 3 bots. The bots were programmed with varying levels of behavioural randomness and different geodesic locations. We show that bots acting with small levels of random noise and placed in central locations meaningfully improve the collective performance of human groups, accelerating the median solution time by 55.6%. This is especially the case when the coordination problem is hard. Behavioural randomness worked not only by making the task of humans to whom the bots were connected easier, but also by affecting the gameplay of the humans among themselves and hence creating further cascades of benefit in global coordination in these heterogeneous systems. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

,Locus Of Control Predicts Appraisals And Cardiovascular Reactivity To A Novel Active Coping Task,"These two studies investigated the influence of dispositional locus of control (LOC) on subjective and physiological responses to a novel laboratory stressor task. Across two studies, 64 healthy undergraduate students, ages 18-22, completed Levenson's (LOC) scales for internal, powerful others, and chance prior to performing a video-game task. Participants rated pretask and posttask stressfulness and coping ability (i.e., measures of primary and secondary appraisal). Cardiovascular measures (heart period, HP; preejection period, PEP; respiratory sinus arrhythmia, RSA; cardiac output, CO; systolic blood pressure, SBP; diastolic blood pressure, DBP & total peripheral resistance, TPR) were recorded during 4-minute baseline and 4-minute stressor task periods. The internal LOC factor predicted pretask reports of coping ability as well as posttask reports of stressfulness. In contrast, the powerful-others LOC factor predicted cardiac changes (HP, PEP, and RSA) during the task but not cardiac output or any other vascular change measure. These results underscore the importance of using the three subscales of the Levenson LOC to assess relationships between dispositional LOC and the response to stressors because self-reported appraisals of a task are predicted by a different component of dispositional LOC than are task-related cardiovascular functions. © 2006, Blackwell Publishing, Inc.",doi,10.1111/j.1467-6494.2006.00396.x,Scopus,Journal of Personality,"Weinstein S.E., Quigley K.S.",2006,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Management Of Complex Systems: Toward Agent-Based Gaming For Policy,"In this chapter, we discuss the implications of complexities in societal systems for management. After discussing some essential features of complex systems, we discuss the current focus of managers and management theory on prediction and the problems arising from this perspective. A short overview is given of the leadership and management literature, identifying what information is lacking concerning the management of complex systems. Next agent-based gaming, which allows for modeling a virtual and autonomous population in a computer-game setting, is introduced as a tool to explore the possibilities to manage complex systems. The chapter concludes with a research agenda for management and leadership in complex systems. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",doi,10.1007/978-3-319-12784-2_13,Scopus,"Policy Practice and Digital Science: Integrating Complex Systems, Social Simulation and Public Administration in Policy Research","Jager W., Van der Vegt G.",2015,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Mario Becomes Cognitive,"In line with Allen Newell's challenge to develop complete cognitive architectures, and motivated by a recent proposal for a unifying subsymbolic computational theory of cognition, we introduce the cognitive control architecture SEMLINCS. SEMLINCS models the development of an embodied cognitive agent that learns discrete production rule-like structures from its own, autonomously gathered, continuous sensorimotor experiences. Moreover, the agent uses the developing knowledge to plan and control environmental interactions in a versatile, goal-directed, and self-motivated manner. Thus, in contrast to several well-known symbolic cognitive architectures, SEMLINCS is not provided with production rules and the involved symbols, but it learns them. In this paper, the actual implementation of SEMLINCS causes learning and self-motivated, autonomous behavioral control of the game figure Mario in a clone of the computer game Super Mario Bros. Our evaluations highlight the successful development of behavioral versatility as well as the learning of suitable production rules and the involved symbols from sensorimotor experiences. Moreover, knowledge- and motivation-dependent individualizations of the agents’ behavioral tendencies are shown. Finally, interaction sequences can be planned on the sensorimotor-grounded production rule level. Current limitations directly point toward the need for several further enhancements, which may be integrated into SEMLINCS in the near future. Overall, SEMLINCS may be viewed as an architecture that allows the functional and computational modeling of embodied cognitive development, whereby the current main focus lies on the development of production rules from sensorimotor experiences.

,Meaningful Video Games: Drama-Based Video Games As Transformational Experience,"The development of more meaningful video games is becoming increasingly possible by recent advances in video game technologies, neurosciences, and biofeedback. In the near future, meaningful video games will be designed to facilitate personal-psychological transformation. Unlike ""serious games"" that focus on education and ""conditioning"" the mind, meaningful games will cultivate emotional intelligence, somatic awareness, and archetypal integration in order to ""un-condition"" the mind and thereby facilitate psychologically meaningful personal transformations. Meaningful game research will access the dynamics of psychological transformation in order to enhance archetypal awareness, intuition, and insight on the part of players. Within the genre of meaningful video games, Drama-Based Games (DBG) add an unprecedented dimension for psychological engagement and decision-making. Because they extend psychological player immersion to the dimension of ""physical"" interactivity, (DBG) incorporate the full range of psychological functions defined by Carl Jung. Because psychological experiences are correlated with physiological processes, DBG may be used as research instruments for quantifying diverse biometric-psychological interactions that occur during game play. Advances in electronics now enable the real-time and non-intrusive capturing of physiological data such as brain waves (e.g., electroencephalography), heart-rate variability, skin response, and facial expression. This data can provide an objective basis for measuring dimensions of the cognitive unconscious in test subjects as they respond to game experiences. The ultimate goal of research is to provide veridical data relative to the psychological parameters of an increasingly mediated global environment-a Psychecology-and to study the ensuing world-view. © 2011, IGI Global.",doi,10.4018/978-1-60960-567-4.ch019,Scopus,"Business, Technological, and Social Dimensions of Computer Games: Multidisciplinary Developments","Schafer S.B., Yu G.",2011,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Media Violence And Social Neuroscience: New Questions And New Opportunities,"Decades of research have demonstrated that exposure to violence on television can cause increases in aggression. The recent emergence of violent video games has raised new questions regarding the effects of violent media. The General Aggression Model (GAM) predicts that exposure to violent media increases aggressive behavior through one of three primary pathways (arousal, cognitions, and affect). Past psychophysiological research has supported GAM but has been limited to examining arousal-related variables. Recent advances in social neuroscience have opened the door to investigations of exposure to violent media on cognitive and affective components and their neurocognitive underpinnings. Neuroscience tools have the potential to provide answers to the new questions posed by recent advances in media technology. © Copyright © 2007 Association for Psychological Science.",doi,10.1111/j.1467-8721.2007.00499.x,Scopus,Current Directions in Psychological Science,"Carnagey N.L., Anderson C.A., Bartholow B.D.",2007,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,"Mental Beliefs About Blood, And Not Its Smell, Affect Presence In A Violent Computer Game","Presence in virtual reality - the feeling that one is inside mediated reality - has fascinated academics in the field of virtual reality from its onset. While conceptual analyses and empirical research unequivocally stressed the importance of immersion through sensory input, agent-related aspects such as mental beliefs received less attention. We are the first to examine the separate and combined effects of being exposed to the smell of a particular stimulus and/or having a representation of this stimulus in mind. Blood was considered to be interesting to work with, because of widespread folk ideas about its capacity to induce aggression in violent contexts. Using a violent computer game in a between-subjects design, male subjects were tested for the immersive impact of blood, first as an olfactory cue, and second as a mental belief, i.e. the true or false belief that one is smelling 'blood'. Lower skin conductance and game scores showed that 'blood' served as a distractor hindering the subject's spontaneous engagement. Subjects higher in dispositional aggressiveness, however, got more immersed during the 'blood' game rounds, by displaying more combativeness. We discuss our results in light of the undervalued importance of subjective realism in research on presence, and explain the relevance of this work for applications in virtual training in the military and for clinical intervention in combat-related PTSD. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.chb.2016.06.012,Scopus,Computers in Human Behavior,"Verplaetse J., De Smet D.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Metabolic And Physiologic Responses To Video Game Play In 7- To 10-Year-Old Boys,"Objective: To examine the metabolic, physiologic, and hemostatic responses to action video game play in a group of young boys. Design: Comparison study. Setting: Laboratory of Clinical and Applied Physiology, University of Miami. Participants: Twenty-one boys aged 7 to 10 years. Main Outcome Measures: Blood pressure monitored before and during game play and blood glucose and lactate levels measured before and immediately after game play. Measurements were continuously recorded throughout game play. Dependent t tests were used to compare measurements recorded at baseline and during or after game play. Effect sizes using the Cohen d were examined for comparisons. Results: Significant increases from baseline were found for heart rate (18.8%; P<.001), systolic (22.3%; P<.001) and diastolic (5.8%; P = .006) blood pressure, ventilation (51.9%; P<.001), respiratory rate (54.8%; P<.001), oxygen consumption (49.0%; P<.001), and energy expenditure (52.9%; P<.001). Effect sizes for these comparisons were medium or large. No significant changes were found from baseline to after video game play for lactate (18.2% increase; P = .07) and glucose (0.9% decrease; P = .59) levels. Conclusions: Video game play results in significant increases in various metabolic and physiologic variables in young children. Thus, it should not be combined with television viewing for the evaluation of sedentary activities. The magnitude of change, however, was lower than that observed during standard physical exercise and below national health recommendations. As such, video game play should not be considered a substitute for regular physical activities that significantly stress the metabolic pathways required for the promotion of cardiovascular conditioning. ©2006 American Medical Association.

,Metabolic Implications For The Mechanism Of Mitochondrial Endosymbiosis And Human Hereditary Disorders,"The endosymbiosis of proto-mitochondrial prokaryotes (PMP) into proto-eukaryotic host-cells was a major advance in eukaryotic evolution. The nature of the initial relationship remains the subject of controversy. Various conceptual models have been proposed, but none has definitive support. We construct a model of inter-species interactions based upon well-established respiratory pathways, describing the respective energy gain of host-cell and PMP resulting from varying levels of cooperation. The model demonstrates conflicting evolutionary strategies (""Prisoner's Dilemmas"") in the interspecies molecular transfers. Nevertheless, we show that coercion and iterated, multilevel selection on both species encourage endosymbiosis. Mutualism is favored if host-cells are significantly more effective than PMPs at gathering food. Otherwise, an unambiguous asymmetry between host-cell and PMP benefits implies that the initial relationship consisted of the host-cell deriving a reproductive advantage at the PMPs' expense-a cellular version of farming. Other initial relationships such as oxygen-detoxification mutualism and parasitism are not strongly supported by the model. We compare the model behavior with experiments on mutant human mitochondria and find the model predicts proliferation rates consistent with that data. We derive from the evolutionary dynamics counter-intuitive therapeutic targets for two human hereditary mitochondrial disorders that reflect the ongoing effect of short-term selection at the mitochondrial level. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

,Metabolic Requirements Of Interactive Video Game Cycling,"Background: Interactive video game exercise leads to improved exercise adherence and health-related physical fitness in comparison to traditional stationary cycling. It has been postulated that interactive video game exercise has greater metabolic requirements than traditional cycling; however, this has not been tested to date. Purpose: To examine the metabolic requirements of interactive video game exercise in comparison to traditional stationary cycling at matched incremental workloads. Methods: Fourteen participants (seven males and seven females) were examined during three separate sessions: 1) incremental cycle ergometer exercise for the assessment of maximal aerobic power and peak workload; 2) traditional cycling on a cycle ergometer using 5-min constant workloads of 25%, 50%, and 75% of maximal power output; and 3) cycling using identical constant, relative workloads while playing interactive video games. Measurements of oxygen consumption, heart rate, and rating of perceived exertion were assessed throughout. Results: During interactive video game exercise, steady-state heart rate (26% ± 18% and 14% ± 13%), energy expenditure (61% ± 41% and 25% ± 21%), and oxygen consumption (34% ± 17% and 18% ± 12%) were significantly higher at the constant submaximal workloads of 25% and 50%, respectively. There was no significant difference in rating of perceived exertion between conditions at any workload. Conclusions: Interactive video game cycling results in greater metabolic requirements (despite similar perceptions of exertion) at submaximal constant workloads than traditional cycling. This form of training may be a novel and an attractive intervention in the battle against physical inactivity and associated health complications. © 2009 The American College of Sports Medicine.",doi,10.1249/MSS.0b013e31819012bd,Scopus,Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise,"Warburton D.E.R., Sarkany D., Johnson M., Rhodes R.E., Whitford W., Esch B.T.A., Scott J.M., Wong S.C., Bredin S.S.D.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Metabolic Responses To Wii Fit ™ Video Games At Different Game Levels,"The Wii Fit ™ is a form of interactive gaming designed to elicit health and fitness benefits to replace sedentary gaming. This study was designed to determine the effectiveness of Wii Fit ™ fitness games. The purpose of the study was to determine the %̇VO 2max and energy expenditure from different Wii Fit ™ games at different levels including the step and hula games. Eight healthy young women completed a preliminary trial to determine ̇VO 2max and later played the Wii Fit ™ during 2 separate counterbalanced trials. During each session, subjects played levels of Wii Fit ™ games for 10 minutes each level. One session involved beginning and intermediate hula, and the other session involved beginning and intermediate steps. The ̇VO 2 was measured continuously via metabolic cart, and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) was assessed at the end of each game level. The lowest %Vo 2max, kcal-min -1, and RPE occurred during the beginning step game and the highest values occurred during the intermediate hula game. Respiratory exchange ratio was significantly higher in the intermediate hula than beginning hula game but was not significantly different between step game levels. The intermediate hula and step games produced the greatest energy expenditure with an equivalent effect of a walking speed of &gt;5.63 km-h -1 (&lt;3.5 miles-h -1). This is the first study to determine the percentage of V̇O 2max and caloric expenditure elicited by different Wii Fit ™ video games at different game levels in adults. Findings suggest that the Wii Fit ™ can be used as an effective activity for promoting physical health in this population. © 2011 National Strength and Conditioning Association.",doi,10.1519/JSC.0b013e318207eae9,Scopus,Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research,"Worley J.R., Rogers S.N., Kraemer R.R.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Microcomputer Automated System For Measuring Systolic Time Intervals In Response To Exercise And A Psychophysiological Task,"A microcomputer automated system for measuring systolic time intervals is described. Electrocardiogram, phonocardiogram, and carotid pulse tracings were measured in 38 healthy male subjects during baseline conditions and during either exercise on a bicycle ergometer or a video‐game task. These measurements were recorded on both a traditional 3‐channel ECG recorder and the computerized system. Both methods of recording systolic time intervals were independently scored by two different experimenters. In this way, interrater reliability of hand‐scoring, intermethod reliability between hand‐scoring versus computer‐scoring, and interrater reliability of computer‐scoring could be assessed. The interrater reliabilities of hand‐scored systolic time intervals were generally above .90, ranging from .73 for left ventricular ejection time to .99 for R‐R intervals of the ECG, with a mean of .92. The intermethod reliability of the computer versus hand‐scored systolic time intervals also proved to be generally above .90, ranging from .76 for S1‐S2 components of the phonocardiogram to .99 for R‐R, with a mean of .94. The interrater reliabilities of the computer‐scored systolic time intervals were all above .90, ranging from .93 for S1‐S2 to .99 for R‐R, with a mean of .98. These data indicate that the computerized method of scoring systolic time intervals is at least as reliable as the more traditional scoring of paper tracing. Copyright © 1988, Wiley Blackwell.

,Modeling Of Autonomous Problem Solving Process By Dynamic Construction Of Task Models In Multiple Tasks Environment,"Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) supposes a complex but single task to be solved. When a RL agent faces a task similar to a learned one, the agent must relearn the task from the beginning because it doesn't reuse the past learned results. This is the problem of quick action learning, which is the foundation of decision making in the real world. In this paper, we suppose agents that can solve a set of tasks similar to each other in a multiple tasks environment, where we encounter various problems one after another, and propose a technique of action learning that can quickly solve similar tasks by reusing previously learned knowledge. In our method, a model-based RL uses a task model constructed by combining primitive local predictors for predicting task and environmental dynamics. To evaluate the proposed method, we performed a computer simulation using a simple ping-pong game with variations. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

,"Mood, Expertise, Analogy, And Ritual: An Experiment Using The Five-Disk Tower Of Hanoi","We used game playing as a proxy for religious ritual in a study of the differential effects of euphoric and dysphoric mood – focusing on expertise and analogical reasoning. Previous research demonstrates that euphoric individuals think more broadly and schematically, and that dysphoric individuals are more focused and details-oriented. We investigated the effect of mood on analogical transfer in four conditions: (1) expert euphoric; (2) expert dysphoric; (3) nonexpert euphoric; and (4) nonexpert dysphoric. Mood was induced from watching a 10-minute video (a comedy excerpt to induce euphoria; a realistic depiction of nuclear war for dysphoria). The affect grid was used for a manipulation check. In expert conditions, participants first played the five-disk Tower of Hanoi (TOH) game, followed by the Bear God (BG) task, a new isomorph of TOH (same rules, different surface features). Participants were not told about the hidden isomorphism. In nonexpert conditions, participants played an unrelated game first. Based on prior literature, it would be possible that dysphoria could either hamper or enhance analogical reasoning. We found evidence for the latter – superior performance in the dysphoric BG task – but only in the expert condition. The implication for religion is that expertise and dysphoria have special cognitive functions in ritual. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",doi,10.1080/2153599X.2014.921861,Scopus,"Religion, Brain and Behavior","Russell Y.I., Gobet F., Whitehouse H.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,More Than A Feeling: Measurement Of Sonic User Experience And Psychophysiology In A First-Person Shooter Game,"The combination of psychophysiological and psychometric methods provides reliable measurements of affective user experience (UX). Understanding the nature of affective UX in interactive entertainment, especially with a focus on sonic stimuli, is an ongoing research challenge. In the empirical study reported here, participants played a fast-paced, immersive first-person shooter (FPS) game modification, in which sound (on/off) and music (on/off) were manipulated, while psychophysiological recordings of electrodermal activity (EDA) and facial muscle activity (EMG) were recorded in addition to a Game Experience Questionnaire (GEQ). Results indicate no main or interaction effects of sound or music on EMG and EDA. However, a significant main effect of sound on all GEQ dimensions (immersion, tension, competence, flow, negative affect, positive affect, and challenge) was found. In addition, an interaction effect of sound and music on GEQ dimension tension and flow indicates an important relationship of sound and music for gameplay experience. Additionally, we report the results of a correlation between GEQ dimensions and EMG/EDA activity. We conclude subjective measures could advance our understanding of sonic UX in digital games, while affective tonic (i.e., long-term psychophysiological) measures of sonic UX in digital games did not yield statistically significant results. One approach for future affective psychophysiological measures of sonic UX could be experiments investigating phasic (i.e., event-related) psychophysiological measures of sonic gameplay elements in digital games. This could improve our general understanding of sonic UX beyond affective gaming evaluation. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",doi,10.1016/j.intcom.2010.04.005,Scopus,Interacting with Computers,"Nacke L.E., Grimshaw M.N., Lindley C.A.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Motivation And Physiologic Responses Of Playing A Physically Interactive Video Game Relative To A Sedentary Alternative In Children,"Background While there is emerging research outlining the physiologic cost of the physically interactive Nintendo Wii, there are no evaluations of the relative reinforcing value (RRV) of the Wii versus a sedentary alternative. Purpose The purpose of this study is to evaluate the physiologic cost, RRV, and liking of playing Wii Sports Boxing (Wii) versus a traditional sedentary video game (SVG) in 11 lean and 13 overweight/obese 8-to 12-yearold children. Methods Heart rate (HR) and VO2 were assessed during rest, treadmill walking, and playing an SVG and Wii using a counterbalance design. Liking was assessed during treadmill walking and video game play. RRV was assessed for Wii versus SVG. Results Average HR, VO2, and liking were significantly greater for Nintendo Wii (p≤0.001 for all) than all other conditions. Lean children displayed a greater (p≤0.001) peak responding for access to Wii relative to the SVG while overweight/obese children did not (p≥0.16). Conclusion Wii was a well-liked activity of greater physiologic intensity than both the SVG and treadmill walking. Lean children were more motivated while overweight/obese children were equally as motivated to play Wii relative to the SVG. © The Society of Behavioral Medicine 2010.",doi,10.1007/s12160-010-9164-x,Scopus,Annals of Behavioral Medicine,"Penko A.L., Barkley J.E.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Motivations For Videogame Play: Predictors Of Time Spent Playing,"The aim of the current research was to identify factors that are associated with the amount of time people play videogames. The current study extends previous research by exploring this question with a variety of genres of videogames. Five hundred and seventy-three participants completed an online survey of their gaming habits, preferences and their experiences while playing. Beyond differences in hours of play associated with gender and game genres, greater time spent playing was found to be associated with playing with others and with higher experiences of competence, autonomy and relatedness during gameplay. The findings are interpreted in light of previous research and the potential implications for links between videogame play and wellbeing are considered. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

,Motivations In Personalisation Behaviour,"A number of emerging technologies including mobile phones and services, on-line shopping and portals, and games and communities are designed to provide users with control over appearance and functioning. Understanding why users personalise could help design personalisation features so that they promote the acceptance and adoption of information and communication technology (ICT). This paper examines the psychological underpinnings of users' willingness to expend effort to personalise ICT. The important role of the basic need of self-determination [Deci, E.L., Ryan, R.M., 2000. The""what"" and ""why"" of goal pursuits: Human needs and the self-determination of behaviour. Psychological Inquiry 11, 227-268] is argued for. Personalisation features can align the psychological resources with the user's action and therefore enhance performance and enjoyment of use. First, they can promote autonomy and the sense of being an origin and therefore transform technology to 'my technology.' Second, personalisation features can support competence by increasing the effectiveness of user's actions. At its best, personalisation becomes rewarding activity in itself regardless of the achieved effects, for example when personalisable features participate in flow experiences. Third, through its appearance functions, technology can support the basic need of relatedness through expression of emotion and identity, ego-involvement, and territory marking. Several positive effects can be identified: engagement, performance, persistence, identity, social acceptance, and social status. The paper concludes by discussing implications to design. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

A range of traditional and emerging narrative techniques are considered, including The Hero's Journey, three-act structure, the portrayal of human emotions, and character archetypes, from where an in-depth examination of interactive narrative is performed on a range of old and modern games. Initial results pertaining to the time allocated to narrative, the use of back stories, cut scenes, on-screen text, prompts, and game structure are also presented, which reveal a distinct level of uniformity of how interactive narrative is depicted in games spanning over two decades of industry development. The analysis is concluded in the second article, where further results are revealed to help uncover the precise nature of game narratives. © The Author(s) 2011.",doi,10.1177/1555412010364982,Scopus,Games and Culture,Ip B.,2011,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Neural Correlates Of Social Cooperation And Non-Cooperation As A Function Of Psychopathy,"Background: Psychopathy is a disorder involving a failure to experience many emotions that are necessary for appropriate social behavior. In this study, we probed the behavioral, emotional, and neural correlates of psychopathic traits within the context of a dyadic social interaction. Methods: Thirty subjects were imaged with functional magnetic resonance imaging while playing an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma game with human confederates who were outside the scanner. Subjects also completed two self-report psychopathy questionnaires. Results: Subjects scoring higher on psychopathy, particularly males, defected more often and were less likely to continue cooperating after establishing mutual cooperation with a partner. Further, they experienced more outcomes in which their cooperation was not reciprocated (cooperate-defect outcome). After such outcomes, subjects scoring high in psychopathy showed less amygdala activation, suggesting weaker aversive conditioning to those outcomes. Compared with low-psychopathy subjects, subjects higher in psychopathy also showed weaker activation within orbitofrontal cortex when choosing to cooperate and showed weaker activation within dorsolateral prefrontal and rostral anterior cingulate cortex when choosing to defect. Conclusions: These findings suggest that whereas subjects scoring low on psychopathy have emotional biases toward cooperation that can only be overcome with effortful cognitive control, subjects scoring high on psychopathy have an opposing bias toward defection that likewise can only be overcome with cognitive effort. © 2007 Society of Biological Psychiatry.",doi,10.1016/j.biopsych.2006.07.021,Scopus,Biological Psychiatry,"Rilling J.K., Glenn A.L., Jairam M.R., Pagnoni G., Goldsmith D.R., Elfenbein H.A., Lilienfeld S.O.",2007,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Neurocircuits Underlying Cognition-Emotion Interaction In A Social Decision Making Context,"Decision making (DM) in the context of others often entails complex cognition-emotion interaction. While the literature suggests that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), striatum, and amygdala are involved in valuation-based DM and hippocampus in context processing, how these neural mechanisms subserve the integration of cognitive and emotional values in a social context remains unclear. In this study we addressed this gap by systematically manipulating cognition-emotion interaction in a social DM context, when the participants played a card game with a hypothetical opponent in a behavioral study (n = 73) and a functional magnetic-resonance-imaging study (n = 16). We observed that payoff-based behavioral choices were influenced by emotional values carried by face pictures and identified neurocircuits involved in cognitive valuation, emotional valuation, and concurrent cognition-emotion value integration. Specifically, while the vmPFC, amygdala, and ventral striatum were all involved in both cognitive and emotional domains of valuation, these regions played dissociable roles in social DM. The payoff-dependent responses in vmPFC and amygdala, but not ventral striatum, were moderated by the social context. Furthermore, the vmPFC, but not amygdala, not only encoded the opponent's gains as if self's losses, but also represented a ""final common currency"" during valuation-based decisions. The extent to which emotional input influenced choices was associated with the functional connectivity between the value-signaling amygdala and value integrating vmPFC, and also with the functional connectivity between the context-setting hippocampus and value-signaling amygdala and ventral striatum. These results identify brain pathways through which emotion shapes subjective values in a social DM context. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",doi,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.07.017,Scopus,NeuroImage,"Ho S.S., Gonzalez R.D., Abelson J.L., Liberzon I.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas

,No Unified Reward Prediction Error In Local Field Potentials From The Human Nucleus Accumbens: Evidence From Epilepsy Patients,"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), cyclic voltammetry, and single-unit electrophysiology studies suggest that signals measured in the nucleus accumbens (Nacc) during value-based decision making represent reward prediction errors (RPEs), the difference between actual and predicted rewards. Here, we studied the precise temporal and spectral pattern of reward-related signals in the human Nacc. We recorded local field potentials (LFPs) from the Nacc of six epilepsy patients during an economic decision-making task. On each trial, patients decided whether to accept or reject a gamble with equal probabilities of a monetary gain or loss. The behavior of four patients was consistent with choices being guided by value expectations. Expected value signals before outcome onset were observed in three of those patients, at varying latencies and with nonoverlapping spectral patterns. Signals after outcome onset were correlated with RPE regressors in all subjects. However, further analysis revealed that these signals were better explained as outcome valence rather than RPE signals, with gamble gains and losses differing in the power of beta oscillations and in evoked response amplitudes. Taken together, our results do not support the idea that postsynaptic potentials in the Nacc represent a RPE that unifies outcome magnitude and prior value expectation. We discuss the generalizability of our findings to healthy individuals and the relation of our results to measurements of RPE signals obtained from the Nacc with other methods. © 2015 the American Physiological Society.",doi,10.1152/jn.00260.2015,Scopus,Journal of Neurophysiology,"Stenner M.-P., Rutledge R.B., Zaehle T., Schmitt F.C., Kopitzki K., Kowski A.B., Voges J., Heinze H.-J., Dolan R.J.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Not All Digital Word Of Mouth Is Created Equal: Understanding The Respective Impact Of Consumer Reviews And Microblogs On New Product Success,"The expansion of the Internet and social media have triggered a differentiation of the word-of-mouth (WOM) concept, with consumer communication about brands and products now taking place in various settings and forms. Two important digital WOM types are microblogs and consumer reviews. To clarify their differential roles for product success, this study offers a theoretical framework of the influence of these two types of WOM, drawing from consumer information search theory and diffusion theory. The tests of the proposed framework use a longitudinal data set of video game sales and weekly information gathered from microblogs (i.e., over 13 million tweets from Twitter) and consumer reviews (i.e., more than 17,000 Amazon consumer reviews). Analyzing a system of equations provides evidence that the influence of microblogs and consumer reviews on new product success changes over time. Prior to launch, the volumes of microblogs and consumer reviews, together with advertising, represent primary sales drivers. After launch, the volume of microblogs is initially influential, then loses impact, whereas the impact of the volume of consumer reviews continues to grow. The valence of consumer reviews gains significance only near the end of the observation period, but the valence of microblogging is never influential. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",doi,10.1016/j.ijresmar.2016.09.003,Scopus,International Journal of Research in Marketing,"Marchand A., Hennig-Thurau T., Wiertz C.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,On ‘Being There’ A Comparison Of The Effectiveness Of Sporting Event Sponsorship Among Direct And Indirect Audiences,"The purpose of this paper is to assess the effectiveness of feld sponsorship through sponsor recall and recognition across two environments that differ on the degree of felt presence they trigger among viewers: on-site and television. A series of research hypotheses concerning the interaction effects of viewing environment, event – sponsor congruence and arousal intensity were developed. Design/methodology/approach – To test the effect of the viewing environment, a feld experiment was conducted where 44 ice hockey fans attended a professional ice hockey game in the local team’s arena, whereas 44 others saw the same game, at the same time, on television. The participants were randomly assigned to one of the two game viewing conditions. Findings – A higher level of arousal was detrimental to sponsor identifcation in a manner consistent with the intensity of the processing principle according to which arousal polarizes attention resources on the arousing stimulus (the event) while diverting resources away from the peripheral stimuli (the sponsors). In addition, because the event congruent sponsors are more superfcially processed in comparison with the incongruent ones, this negative impact was more pronounced in the former group. This was qualifed by a three-way interaction with the type of environment; the on-site, direct, audience was less affected by the processing intensity principle and exhibited better recall and recognition than the television audience as arousal and congruency increased, whereas, at lower levels of arousal, higher event – sponsor congruence hampered on-site sponsor identifcation in comparison with television. Research limitations/implications – The fndings were obtained in the context of a single sports event; additional studies need to be conducted using different sports. In addition, the comparison of on-site audience with other types of media audiences (e.g. on-line broadcasting) is warranted. Practical implications – Arousal intensity results from the game’s drama, which is a function of game importance and game outcome uncertainty. Hence, except for low-stakes games (e.g. pre-season matches, exhibitions), initiatives that promote a leveled playing feld such as salary cap, fnancial fair play and open leagues are likely to jeopardize sponsor identifcation, particularly for congruent sponsors. With respect to the impact of the viewing environment, congruent sponsors should reap superior benefts from the television audience when the stakes are low. However, when the stakes are high, their benefts will accrue to a greater extent from on-site spectators. Originality/value – This is the frst study to offer a rigorous comparison of sponsorship’s impact on direct (on-site) versus indirect (television) audiences through a feld experiment. This is also the frst research to provide a framework based on the processing intensity principle that encompasses predictions related to arousal and its interaction with event – sponsor congruence and the viewing © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",doi,10.1108/EJM-03-2013-0156,Scopus,European Journal of Marketing,"Carrillat F.A., D’Astous A., Bellavance F., Eid F.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,On Model Design For Simulation Of Collective Intelligence,"The study of collective intelligence (CI) systems is increasingly gaining interest in a variety of research and application domains. Those domains range from existing research areas such as computer networks and collective robotics to upcoming areas of agent-based and insect-based computing; also including applications on the internet and in games and movies. CI systems are complex by nature and (1) are effectively adaptive in uncertain and unknown environments, (2) can organise themselves autonomously, and (3) exhibit 'emergent' behaviour. Among others, multi-agent systems, complex adaptive systems, swarm intelligence and self-organising systems are considered to be such systems. The explosive wild growth of research studies of CI systems has not yet led to a systematic approach for model design of these kinds of systems. Although there have been recent efforts on the issue of system design (the complete design trajectory from identifying system requirements up to implementation), the problem of choosing and specifying a good model of a CI system is often done implicitly and sometimes even completely ignored. The aim of this article is to bring to the attention that model design is an essential as well as an integral part of system design. We present a constructive approach to systematically design, build and test models of CI systems. Because simulation is often used as a way to research CI systems, we particularly focus on models that can be used for simulation. Additionally, we show that it is not necessary to re-invent the wheel: here, we show how existing models and algorithms can be used for CI model design. The approach is illustrated by means of two example studies on a (semi-automated) multi-player game and collaborative robotics. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

,On Modeling Of Coevolution Of Strategies And Structure In Autonomous Overlay Networks,"Currently, on one hand, there exist much work about network formation and/or growth models, and on the other hand, cooperative strategy evolutions are extensively investigated in biological, economic, and social systems. Generally, overlay networks are heterogeneous, dynamic, and distributed environments managed by multiple administrative authorities, shared by users with different and competing interests, or even autonomously provided by independent and rational users. Thus, the structure of a whole overlay network and the peers' rational strategies are ever coevolving. However, there are very few approaches that theoretically investigate the coevolution between network structure and individual rational behaviors. The main motivation of our article lies in that: Unlike existing work which empirically illustrates the interaction between rational strategies and network structure (through simulations), based on EGT (Evolutionary Game Theory), we not only infer a condition that could favor the cooperative strategy over defect strategy, but also theoretically characterizes the structural properties of the formed network. Specifically, our contributions are twofold. First, we strictly derive the critical benefit-to-cost ratio (b/c) that would facilitate the evolution of cooperation. The critical ratio depends on the network structure (the number of peers in system and the average degree of each peer), and the evolutionary rule (the strategy and linking mutation probabilities). Then, according to the evolutionary rules, we formally derive the structural properties of the formed network in full cooperative state. Especially, the degree distribution is compatible with the power-law, and the exponent is (4-3v)/(1-3v), where v is peer's linking mutation probability. Furthermore, we show that, without being harmful to cooperation evolution, a slight change of the evolutionary rule will evolve the network into a small-world structure (high global efficiency and average clustering coefficient), with the same power-law degree distribution as in the original evolution model. © 2012 ACM.",doi,10.1145/2240166.2240167,Scopus,ACM Transactions on Autonomous and Adaptive Systems,"Wang Y., Nakao A., Vasilakos A.V.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Online Monitoring Of The Social Presence Effects In A Two-Person-Like Driving Video Game Using Near-Infrared Spectroscopy,"We examined how a friend's presence affects a performer's prefrontal activation in daily-life activities using two wireless portable near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) devices. Participants played a driving video game either solely in the single group or with a friend in the paired group. The two groups (single and paired) were subdivided according to their game proficiency (low and high). The NIRS data demonstrated a significant interaction of group by proficiency. Low-proficiency players in the paired group showed lower activation than those in the single group, but high-proficiency players did not. In the paired group, high-proficiency players showed higher activation than low-proficiency players, but not in the single group. These results suggest that NIRS detects social presence effects in everyday situations: decreasing prefrontal activation in low-proficiency performers due to tension reduction and increasing prefrontal activation in high-proficiency performers due to increased arousal. © 2015 Japanese Psychological Association.",doi,10.1111/jpr.12080,Scopus,Japanese Psychological Research,"Liu T., Saito H., Oi M.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas

,Openpsi: A Novel Computational Affective Model And Its Application In Video Games,"This paper introduces OpenPsi, a computational model for emotion generation and function by formalizing part of Dörner's PSI theory, which is an extensive psychological model of human brains, including knowledge representation, perception and bounded rationality. We also borrowed some technical ideas from MicroPsi, one of the concrete implementations of PSI theory by Joscha Bach. The proposed emotional model is then applied to control a virtual robot living in a game world inspired by Minecraft. Simulation experiments have been performed and evaluated for three different scenarios. The emergent emotions fit quite well with these circumstances. The dynamics of this affective model are also analyzed using Lewis's dynamic theory of emotions. Evidences of phase transitions suggested by Lewis are observed in simulations, including trigger, self-amplification and self-stabilization phases. These experiment results show that the proposed model is a quite promising approach of modeling both emotion emergence and dynamics. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

,Operation Analysis Of Massively Multiplayer Online Games On Unreliable Resources,"We investigate the use of a new Massively Multiplayer Online Gaming (MMOG) ecosystem consisting of end-users, game providers, game operators, and Cloud resource providers, for autonomous, self-adaptive hosting and operation of MMOGs on unreliable resources. For this purpose, we developed an MMOG simulator compliant with our ecosystem, supported by a dynamic resource provisioning and load balancing algorithm. Using our simulator in which we inject traces collected from a real-world MMOG and resource characteristics from 16 Cloud providers, we study the impact on the involved actors by considering different resource availability levels. We highlight the advantages of dynamic resource allocation over the static overprovisioning with respect to two types of metrics: QoS offered to the clients and financial profit of game providers and operators. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",doi,10.1007/s12083-015-0383-6,Scopus,Peer-to-Peer Networking and Applications,"Prodan R., Iosup A.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Opportunities For Multiagent Systems And Multiagent Reinforcement Learning In Traffic Control,"The increasing demand for mobility in our society poses various challenges to traffic engineering, computer science in general, and artificial intelligence and multiagent systems in particular. As it is often the case, it is not possible to provide additional capacity, so that a more efficient use of the available transportation infrastructure is necessary. This relates closely to multiagent systems as many problems in traffic management and control are inherently distributed. Also, many actors in a transportation system fit very well the concept of autonomous agents: the driver, the pedestrian, the traffic expert; in some cases, also the intersection and the traffic signal controller can be regarded as an autonomous agent. However, the iagentification"" of a transportation system is associated with some challenging issues: the number of agents is high, typically agents are highly adaptive, they react to changes in the environment at individual level but cause an unpredictable collective pattern, and act in a highly coupled environment. Therefore, this domain poses many challenges for standard techniques from multiagent systems such as coordination and learning. This paper has two main objectives: (i) to present problems, methods, approaches and practices in traffic engineering (especially regarding traffic signal control); and (ii) to highlight open problems and challenges so that future research in multiagent systems can address them. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",doi,10.1007/s10458-008-9062-9,Scopus,Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems,Bazzan A.L.C.,2009,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Oscillatory Brain Responses Evoked By Video Game Events: The Case Of Super Monkey Ball 2,"Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded while the subjects played a video game where the player had to steer a monkey into a goal while collecting bananas for extra points and had to avoid falling off the edge of the game board. Each of these three studied events evoked differential EEG oscillatory changes. Picking up bananas evoked decreased theta activation on central electrodes, decreased high alpha activation on frontal electrodes, and increased beta activation on frontal electrodes. Falling off the game board evoked decreased central theta activation and increased fronto-central beta activation. Reaching the goal evoked increased theta activation on parietal electrodes, increased low alpha activation on frontal electrodes, increased high alpha activation on frontal, central, and parietal electrodes, and increased beta activation on frontal and central electrodes. It is suggested that the EEG oscillations evoked by picking up bananas reflect increased cortical activation and arousal; the oscillations evoked by falling off the edge of the game board reflect motor functions; and the oscillations evoked by reaching the goal reflect a relaxed state. Thus, EEG may turn out to be a valuable tool when examining psychological responses to video game events. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",doi,10.1089/cpb.2006.9947,Scopus,Cyberpsychology and Behavior,"Salminen M., Ravaja N.",2007,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,"Pacing, Conventional Physical Activity And Active Video Games To Increase Physical Activity For Adults With Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Protocol For A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial.","Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a serious illness of biological origin characterized by profound physical and cognitive exhaustion and postexertion malaise. Pacing is a common strategy used to manage available energy and complete activities of daily living; yet little research has investigated this as a strategy to increase physical activity levels. Typically, people living with ME/CFS are faced by unique barriers to physical activity participation and are less physically active than healthy peers. As such they are at increased risk of physical inactivity-related health consequences. Active video games may be a feasible and acceptable avenue to deliver physical activity intervention by overcoming many of the reported barriers to participation. The primary objective of this pilot study is to determine the feasibility and acceptability of active video games to increase physical activity levels of people with ME/CFS. The secondary aims are to explore the preliminary effectiveness of pacing and active video gaming to pacing alone and pacing plus conventional physical activity to increase the physical activity levels of adults with ME/CFS and explore the relationship between physical activity and cumulative inflammatory load (allostatic load). This study will use a mixed method design, with a 3-arm pilot randomized controlled trial, exit interviews, and collection of feasibility and process data. A total of 30 adults with ME/CFS will be randomized to receive either (1) pacing, (2) pacing and conventional physical activity, or (3) pacing and active video gaming. The intervention duration will be 6 months, and participants will be followed up for 6 months postintervention completion. The intervention will be conducted in the participant's home, and activity intensity will be determined by continuously monitored heart rate and ratings of perceived exertion. Feasibility and acceptability and process data will be collected during and at the end of the intervention. Health-related outcomes (eg, physical activity, blood samples, quality of life, and functioning) will be collected at baseline, end of intervention, and 6 months after intervention completion. This protocol was developed after 6 months of extensive stakeholder and community consultation. Enrollment began in January 2017; as of publication, 12 participants were enrolled. Baseline testing is scheduled to commence in mid-2017. This pilot study will provide essential feasibility and acceptability data which will guide the use of active video games for people with ME/CFS to increase their physical activity levels. Physical activity promotion in this clinical population has been poorly and under-researched, and any exploration of alternative physical activity options for this population is much needed.

,Pals In Power Armor: Attribution Of Human-Like Emotions To Video Game Characters In An Ingroup/Outgroup Situation,"Previous research has demonstrated the tendency for humans to anthropomorphize computers-that is, to react to computers as social actors, despite knowing that the computers are mere machines. In the present research, we examined the attribution of both primary (non-uniquely human) and secondary (human-like) emotions to ingroup (teammate) and outgroup (opponent) computer-controlled characters in a video game. We found that participants perceived the teammate character as experiencing more secondary emotions than the opponent character, but that they perceived the teammate and opponent character as experiencing equal levels of primary emotions. Thus, participants anthropomorphized the ingroup character to a greater extent than the outgroup character. These results imply that computers' ""emotions"" are treated with a similar ingroup/outgroup social regard as the emotions of actual humans. © Copyright 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",doi,10.1089/cyber.2012.0111,Scopus,"Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking","Besmann A., Rios K.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas

,"Pc-Pvt: A Platform For Psychomotor Vigilance Task Testing, Analysis, And Prediction","Using a personal computer (PC) for simple visual reaction time testing is advantageous because of the relatively low hardware cost, user familiarity, and the relative ease of software development for specific neurobehavioral testing protocols. However, general-purpose computers are not designed with the millisecond-level accuracy of operation required for such applications. Software that does not control for the various sources of delay may return reaction time values that are substantially different from the true reaction times. We have developed and characterized a freely available system for PC-based simple visual reaction time testing that is analogous to the widely used psychomotor vigilance task (PVT). In addition, we have integrated individualized prediction algorithms for near-real-time neurobehavioral performance prediction. We characterized the precision and accuracy with which the system as a whole measures reaction times on a wide range of computer hardware configurations, comparing its performance with that of the ""gold standard"" PVT-192 device. We showed that the system is capable of measuring reaction times with an average delay of less than 10 ms, a margin of error that is comparable to that of the gold standard. The most critical aspect of hardware selection is the type of mouse used for response detection, with gaming mice showing a significant advantage over standard ones.

,Perceived Family Functioning And Friendship Quality: Cross-Sectional Associations With Physical Activity And Sedentary Behaviours,"Background: This study examined the association of adolescent-reported family functioning and friendship quality with objectively-measured moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), sedentary time, and self-reported sedentary behaviours. Methods: Data are from the ROOTS study. MVPA and sedentary time were assessed using combined movement and heart rate sensing. Time spent TV viewing, using the internet, playing video games, doing homework and reading for pleasure was self-reported. Data on objectively-measured and self-reported outcomes for weekdays was available for 738 (age 14.5y, 55.7% female) and 800 (56.3% female) participants, respectively. Adolescents perceived family functioning and friendship quality (Two subscales: 'Good friendship qualities', 'Friendship difficulties') was assessed by questionnaire. Analyses were conducted using multi-level linear or logistic regression. Results: Adolescents reporting better family functioning accumulated more MVPA on weekdays (beta; 95% confidence interval: 0.57; 0.17,0.98). Higher scores on the good friendship qualities subscale was associated with greater MVPA throughout the week (weekdays: 1.13; 0.62,1.65, weekend: 0.56; 0.09,1.02) and lower sedentary time on weekdays (-10.34; -17.03,-3.66). Boys from better functioning families were less likely to report playing video games at the weekend (OR; 95% confidence interval: 0.73; 0.57,0.93) or reading for pleasure (weekday: 0.73; 0.56,0.96 weekend: 0.75; 0.58,0.96). Boys who attained higher scores on the good friendship qualities scale were less likely to play video games at the weekend (0.61; 0.44,0.86) or report high homework on weekdays (0.54; 0.31,0.94). A higher score for good friendship qualities was associated with lower odds of girls playing video games during the week (0.76; 0.58,1.00) or reading for pleasure at the weekend (0.61; 0.42,0.88). Girls that reported fewer friendship difficulties had lower odds of high TV viewing (0.76; 0.62,0.93) or playing video games (0.71; 0.52,0.97) at the weekend, and lower odds of reading for pleasure (0.63; 0.49,0.81) or reporting high homework on weekdays (0.70; 0.52,0.95). Discussion: Family functioning and friendship quality exhibit a complex pattern of association with physical activity and sedentary behaviour that varies by sex and day of the week. Findings highlight the potential value of targeting interpersonal aspects of the family and friendships as an adjunct to behaviour change interventions. © 2015 Atkin et al.",doi,10.1186/s12966-015-0180-x,Scopus,International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity,"Atkin A.J., Corder K., Goodyer I., Bamber D., Ekelund U., Brage S., Dunn V., Van Sluijs E.M.F.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Perception Of Psychopathy And The Uncanny Valley In Virtual Characters,"Virtual characters with a realistic, human-like appearance are increasingly being used in video games and animation. However, increased realism does not necessarily imply increased acceptance and factors such as aberrant facial expression may evoke the Uncanny Valley phenomenon. In humans, personality traits such as anger, callousness, coldness, dominance, being unconcerned, and untrustworthiness are associated with psychopathy; a visual facial marker of this condition being a lack of visible response in the eye region to emotive situations. As such, the present study investigated if inadequate upper facial animation in human-like virtual characters evoked the uncanny due to a perception of psychopathic traits within a character. The results revealed that virtual characters that showed a lack of a startle response to a scream sound were regarded as most uncanny and perceptions of personality traits associated with psychopathy were a strong predictor of reported uncanniness but, that other negative personality traits not associated with psychopathy were not. The study presents possible psychological drivers of uncanniness to inform designers why a lack of detail in a character's upper face when portraying a startle response may evoke perception of specific negative personality traits in a character, to help control the uncanny in character design. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

,Perceptual Illusions And Military Realities: Results From A Computer-Simulated Arms Race,"Traditionally, the most common game-theoretic model of the nuclear arms race has been the Prisoner's Dilemma, in which participants are bound in conflict by the structure of the situation. Recent evidence suggests, however, that the nuclear arms race may be better approximated by a “Perceptual Dilemma” arising from discrepant perceptions of various outcome utilities. The present experiment compared the effects of two strategies, a matching strategy (called Status Quo) and a matching strategy preceded by unconditional cooperation (called Disarmament Initiatives), within the context of a Prisoner's Dilemma or a Perceptual Dilemma. Results indicated that: (a) the Status Quo strategy sustained competitive behavior, attitudes, and emotions in both the Prisoner's Dilemma and the Perceptual Dilemma; and (b) the Disarmament Initiatives strategy induced significantly more cooperation among subjects locked in a Perceptual Dilemma than those in a Prisoner's Dilemma. The limitations, extensions, and implications of these findings are discussed in terms of political action and future research. © 1987, Sage Publications.

,"Phases Of Functional, Near-Normoglycaemic Insulin Substitution: What Are Computers Good For In The Rehabilitation Process In Type I (Insulin-Dependent) Diabetes Mellitus?","We have divided the rehabilitation process in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus into the following four phases. The basic phase, the so-called 'phase 0', provides information about literature, different strategies of treatment and introduces the use of regular insulin as well as blood sugar self-monitoring. During the 'phase 1' (i.e. 'diabetes education common sense') all the initial information from 'phase 0' will be used practically and discussed in depth. After the patient's actual insulin need (U/24 h) has been estimated, initial algorithms for functional insulin use can be defined. And this is the turning point to 'phase 2' of the group rehabilitation process, the so-called education in functional insulin use. Initial algorithms should be understood as a preliminary answer to the patient's questions, 'What is my basal insulin need?', 'How much insulin do I need for a particular amount of carbohydrates?', and 'What is the hypothetical response of my blood glucose to a particular amount of insulin?'. These algorithms are going to be used and optimised now by the patient (under the supervision of the physician) during the so-called 'insulin games' (fasting or 24 h, experimental violation of traditional dietary rules, etc.) to demonstrate (1) how to influence actual glycaemia through immediate correction of blood sugar off blood sugar target (primary adjustment of insulin dosing), and (2) how to optimise algorithms for insulin use (secondary insulin adjustment) in future conditions of different insulin sensitivity. The 'phase 3' of individual teaching is an ongoing process of updating the patient's knowledge and practical skills. All these phases (0-3) usually require about 40-50 h of (group) teaching. Functional insulin substitution was proposed for 340 type I diabetic patients. The mean glycosilated haemoglobin decreased to the upper limit of normal range in out-patients under the condition of free diet and remains still in this range despite low frequency of acute complications (Diabetologia 30 (1987) 47-48; p < 0.0001 vs. initial values). Computers are used for experimental purposes in all these phases of the rehabilitation process: (1) for the initial (programmed) information ('phase 0'), (2) for estimation of initial algorithms ('phase 1'), (3) as a training computer in the blood sugar simulation process ('phase 2'), and (4) for statistical evaluation of out-patients' clinical data and for up-dating the patient's knowledge ('phase 3'), as an 'artificial diabetes counsellor'. However, computers are still not used by the patient on a routine basis at present. © 1990.",doi,10.1016/0169-2607(90)90115-P,Scopus,Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine,"Howorka K., Thoma H., Grillmayr H., Kitzler E.",1990,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Physical Activities In Adolescent Girls. Variability In Energy Expenditure,"Background: Understanding interindividual variability of energy expended in common activities is important for determining precise estimates of energy expenditure in surveillance studies and clinical trials. The purpose of this study was to describe the variability in energy expenditure for selected physical activities among adolescent girls. Methods: Seventy-four adolescent girls (aged 13 to 14 years) participated in this cross-sectional investigation. Data were collected in 2001 and analyzed in 2004. Energy expenditure was measured by indirect calorimetry for ten activities and during a submaximal cycle ergometer test, which was used to estimate cardiorespiratory fitness. Variability in energy expended for the various activities was expressed by standard deviation, coefficient of variation, and range for three different energy expenditure variables: relative VO2 (milliliters per kilogram per minute), absolute VO2 (liters per minute-1), and calculated metabolic rate (kilojoules per minute). Results: Depending on the expression of energy expenditure, coefficients of variation ranged from a low of 13.2% for climbing stairs to a high of 38.4% for playing a computer game. Some lower-intensity activities were associated with greater variability in energy expenditure. Bicycling showed consistently higher coefficients of variation across expressions of energy expenditure (29.1%, 37.7%, and 33.5% for relative VO2, absolute VO2, and calculated metabolic rate, respectively). Conclusions: Energy expenditure for common activities is highly variable in adolescent girls. The coefficient of variation was higher in some activities of lower intensity, regardless of energy expenditure expression. This variance may influence the evaluation of physical activity interventions, particularly with regard to issues such as a prescribed dose of activity and the statistical power to detect change. © 2006 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.",doi,10.1016/j.amepre.2006.06.002,Scopus,American Journal of Preventive Medicine,"Pfeiffer K.A., Schmitz K.H., McMurray R.G., Treuth M.S., Murray D.M., Pate R.R.",2006,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Physical And Perceptual-Cognitive Demands Of Top-Class Refereeing In Association Football,"The aim of this study was to examine the physical and perceptual-cognitive demands imposed on UEFA top-class referees and assistant referees during the final round of the Euro 2000 Championship. To investigate the physical workload, the heart rates during matches were monitored by short-range radio telemetry and translated to different workloads expressed as a percentage of maximal heart rate. For measurement of the perceptual-cognitive workload, video-recordings of games were used to obtain the average number of observable decisions taken by a referee. On average, referees and assistant referees performed the matches at 85 ± 5% and 77 ± 7% of their maximal heart rate, respectively. Over the 31 games, the mean number of observable decisions was 137 (range 104-162), 64% of which were based on communication with the assistant referees and/or the fourth official. To optimize the physical preparation of top-class match officials, the results of this study support the application of intensive and intermittent training sessions, which should place priority on high-intensity aerobic stimuli. In addition, video training is discussed as an additional method for improving match officials' decision making.",doi,10.1080/02640410310001641502,Scopus,Journal of Sports Sciences,"Helsen W., Bultynck J.-B.",2004,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Physical Training In Boys With Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy: The Protocol Of The No Use Is Disuse Study,"Background: ""Use it or lose it"" is a well known saying which is applicable to boys with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). Besides the direct effects of the muscular dystrophy, the increasing effort to perform activities, the fear of falling and the use of personal aids indirectly impair leg and arm functions as a result of disuse. Physical training could oppose this secondary physical deterioration. The No Use is Disuse (NUD) study is the first study in human subjects with DMD that will examine whether a low-intensity physical training is beneficial in terms of preservation of muscle endurance and functional abilities. The study consists of two training intervention studies: study 1 ""Dynamic leg and arm training for ambulant and recently wheelchair-dependent boys with DMD and, study 2 ""Functional training with arm support for boys with DMD who have been confined to a wheelchair for several years"". This paper describes the hypotheses and methods of the NUD study.Methods: Study 1 is an explorative randomized controlled trial with multiple baseline measurements. Thirty boys with a DNA-established diagnosis of DMD will be included. The intervention consists of a six-months physical training during which boys train their legs and arms with active and/or assisted cycling training equipment. The primary study outcomes are muscle endurance and functional abilities, assessed with a Six-Minute Bicycle Test and the Motor Function Measure. Study 2 has a within-group repeated measurements design and will include ten boys with DMD who have already been confined to a wheelchair for several years. The six-months physical training program consists of 1) a computer-assisted training and 2) a functional training with an arm support. The primary study outcome is functional abilities of the upper extremity, assessed with the Action Research Arm Test.Discussion: The NUD study will fill part of the gap in the current knowledge about the possible effects of training in boys with DMD and will increase insight into what type of exercise should be recommended to boys with DMD. The study will finish at the end of 2010 and results are expected in 2011.Trial registration: The Netherlands National Trial Register1631. © 2010 Jansen et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",doi,10.1186/1471-2431-10-55,Scopus,BMC Pediatrics,"Jansen M., de Groot I.J.M., van Alfen N., Geurts A.C.H.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Physiological And Brain Activity After A Combined Cognitive Behavioral Treatment Plus Video Game Therapy For Emotional Regulation In Bulimia Nervosa: A Case Report,"Background: PlayMancer is a video game designed to increase emotional regulation and reduce general impulsive behaviors, by training to decrease arousal and improve decision-making and planning. We have previously demonstrated the usefulness of PlayMancer in reducing impulsivity and improving emotional regulation in bulimia nervosa (BN) patients. However, whether these improvements are actually translated into brain changes remains unclear. Objective: The aim of this case study was to report on a 28-year-old Spanish woman with BN, and to examine changes in physiological variables and brain activity after a combined treatment of video game therapy (VGT) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Methods: Ten VGT sessions were carried out on a weekly basis. Anxiety, physiological, and impulsivity measurements were recorded. The patient was scanned in a 1.5-T magnetic resonance scanner, prior to and after the 10-week VGT/CBT combined treatment, using two paradigms: (1) an emotional face-matching task, and (2) a multi-source interference task (MSIT). Results: Upon completing the treatment, a decrease in average heart rate was observed. The functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) results indicated a post-treatment reduction in reaction time along with high accuracy. The patient engaged areas typically active in healthy controls, although the cluster extension of the active areas decreased after the combined treatment. Conclusions: These results suggest a global improvement in emotional regulation and impulsivity control after the VGT therapy in BN, demonstrated by both physiological and neural changes. These promising results suggest that a combined treatment of CBT and VGT might lead to functional cerebral changes that ultimately translate into better cognitive and emotional performances. ©Ana Beatriz Fagundo, Esther Via, Isabel Sánchez, Susana Jiménez-Murcia, Laura Forcano, Carles Soriano-Mas, Cristina Giner-Bartolomé, Juan J Santamaría, Maher Ben-Moussa, Dimitri Konstantas, Tony Lam, Mikkel Lucas, Jeppe Nielsen, Peter Lems, Narcís Cardoner, Jose M Menchón, Rafael de la Torre, Fernando Fernandez-Aranda.",doi,10.2196/jmir.3243,Scopus,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"Fagundo A.B., Via E., Sánchez I., Jiménez-Murcia S., Forcano L., Soriano-Mas C., Giner-Bartolomé C., Santamaría J.J., Ben-Moussa M., Konstantas D., Lam T., Lucas M., Nielsen J., Lems P., Cardoner N., Menchón J.M., De La Torre R., Fernandez-Aranda F.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Physiological And Skill Demands Of 'On-Side' And 'Off-Side' Games,"This study investigated the physiological and skill demands of 'on-side' and 'off-side' games in elite rugby league players. Sixteen male rugby league players participated in 'on-side' and 'off-side' games. Both small-sided games were played in a 40-× 40-m playing area. The 'off-side' game permitted players to have 3 'plays' while in possession of the ball. Players were permitted to pass backward or forward (to an 'off-side' player). The 'on-side' game also permitted players to have 3 'plays' while in possession of the ball. However, players were only permitted to pass backward to players in an 'on-side' position. Heart rate and movement patterns (via global positioning system) were recorded continuously throughout both games. Data were collected on the distance covered, number of high-acceleration and velocity efforts, and recovery between efforts. Video footage was also taken to track the performance of the players. Post hoc inspection of the footage was undertaken to count the number of possessions and the number and quality of disposals. In comparison to 'on-side' games, 'off-side' games had a greater number of involvements (""touches""), passes, and effective passes. However, the cognitive demands of 'on-side' games were greater than 'off-side' games. 'Off-side' games resulted in a greater total distance covered, greater distance covered in mild and moderate accelerations, and greater distance covered in low, moderate, and high-velocity efforts. There were also a greater number of short duration recovery periods between efforts in 'off-side' games. The results of this study demonstrate that 'off-side' games provide greater physiological and skill demands than 'on-side' games. 'Offside' games may provide a practical alternative to 'on-side' games for the development of skill and fitness in elite rugby league players. © 2010 National Strength and Conditioning Association.",doi,10.1519/JSC.0b013e3181e72731,Scopus,Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research,"Gabbett T.J., Jenkins D.G., Abernethy B.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,"Physiological Aspects Of Flow Experiences: Skills-Demand-Compatibility Effects On Heart Rate Variability And Salivary Cortisol. Journal Of Experimental Social Psychology, 47(4), 849–852.","This research addresses flow theory according to which the compatibility of skills and task demands involved in an activity elicits flow experiences that render the activity intrinsically rewarding. Departing from correlational research, we applied experimental paradigms designed to test the impact of a skills-demands-compatibility on the emergence of flow in computerized tasks. On the one hand, the results from self-reports support the balance hypothesis and indicate that skills-demands-compatibility results in a pleasurable flow experience. On the other hand, the results also indicate that skills-demands-compatibility resulted in (a) reduced heart rate variability indicating enhanced mental workload, and (b) stress as indicated by relatively high levels of salivary cortisol. These results indicate that flow experiences combine subjectively positive elements with physiological elements reflecting strainful tension and mental load.",doi,10.1016/j.jesp.2011.02.004,nagy2015,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,"Keller, J., Bless, H., Blomann, F., Kleinböhl, D.",2011,NA,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Physiological Compliance For Social Gaming Analysis: Cooperative Versus Competitive Play,"We report the results of an empirical study demonstrating the value of using physiological compliance as a measure of social presence during digital game playing. The physiological activity (facial EMG, electrodermal activity, cardiac activity and respiration) of 21 dyads were acquired synchronously while they were playing a digital game either cooperatively or competitively and either at home or in the laboratory. Physiological compliance was defined as the correlation between the physiological signals of the dyad members. The results of this study confirm that physiological compliance is higher in a conflicting situation than when playing cooperatively. Importantly, the results also demonstrate that physiological compliance is related to self-reported social presence. This suggests that physiological compliance is not limited to negative situations but rather increases due to rich interactions. Only minor differences in physiological compliance were observed between home play and laboratory play, suggesting the ecological validity of laboratory measures. Finally, we propose that compliance measures can be considered as objective indices of social presence in digital gaming. © 2012 British Informatics Society Limited.

,Physiological Correlates Of The Flow Experience During Computer Game Playing,"Flow is the subjective experience of effortless attention, reduced self-awareness, and enjoyment that typically occurs during optimal task performance. Previous studies have suggested that flow may be associated with a non-reciprocal coactivation of the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems and, on a cortical level, with a state of hypofrontality and implicit processing. Here, we test these hypotheses, using the computer game TETRIS as model task. The participants (n= 77) played TETRIS under three conditions that differed in difficulty (Easy < Optimal < Difficult). Cardiac and respiratory activities, and the average oxygenation changes of the prefrontal cortex were measured continuously with functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) during performance. The Optimal condition was characterized by the highest levels of state flow, positive affect, and effortless attention. The associations between self-reported psychological flow and physiological measures were investigated using a series of repeated measures linear mixed model analyses. The results showed that higher flow was associated with larger respiratory depth and lower LF. The higher respiratory depth during high flow is indicative of a more relaxed state with an increased parasympathetic activity, and thus provides partial support for the main hypotheses. There was no association between frontal cortical oxygenation and flow, even at liberal thresholds; i.e. we found no support that flow is related to a state of hypofrontality. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",doi,10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2015.05.001,Scopus,International Journal of Psychophysiology,"Harmat L., de Manzano T., Theorell T., Högman L., Fischer H., Ullén F.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Physiological Mouse: Toward An Emotion-Aware Mouse,"Human-centered computing is rapidly becoming a major research direction as new developments in sensor technology make it increasingly feasible to obtain signals from human beings. At the same time, the pervasiveness of computing devices is also encouraging more research in human–computer interaction, especially in the direction of personalized and adaptive user interfaces. Among the various research issues, affective computing, or the ability of computers to understand and react according to what a user “feels,” has been gaining in importance. In order to recognize the human affect (feeling), computers rely on the analysis of signal inputs captured by a multitude of means. This paper proposes the use of human physiological signals as a new form of modality in determining human affects, in a non-intrusive manner. The principle of non-invasiveness is very important, since it imposes no extra burden on the user, which improves user accessibility and encourages user adoption. This goal is realized via the physiological mouse, as a first step toward the support of affective computing. The conventional mouse is converted with a small optical component for capturing user photoplethysmographic (PPG) signal. With the PPG signal, it is possible to compute and derive human physiological signals. A prototype of the physiological mouse was built and raw PPG readings measured. The accuracy of the approach was evaluated through empirical studies to determine human physiological signals from the mouse PPG data. Finally, pilot experiments to correlate human physiological signals with various modes of human–computer interaction, namely gaming and video watching, were conducted. The trend in physiological signals could be used as feedback to the computer system which in turn adapts to the needs or the mood of the user, for instance change the volume and the light intensity when watching a video or playing a game based on current user emotion. The authors argue that this research will provide a new dimension for multimodal affective computing research, and the pilot study has already shed some light toward this research goal. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",doi,10.1007/s10209-016-0469-9,Scopus,Universal Access in the Information Society,"Fu Y., Leong H.V., Ngai G., Huang M.X., Chan S.C.F.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Physiological Responses And Match Characteristics In Professional Tennis Players During A One-Hour Simulated Tennis Match,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of serve and return game situations on physiological responses and match characteristics in professional male tennis players during one hour-long simulated singles tennis matches. Ten internationally ranked tennis players (age 22.2 ± 2.8 years; body height 180.7 ± 4.4 cm; body mass 75.9 ± 8.9 kg) participated in this study. Their physiological responses were measured using two portable analyzers during indoor hard court matches. Ratings of perceived exertion were also determined at the end of the game. The variables describing the characteristics of the matches determined from video recordings were: (a) duration of rallies; (b) rest time; (c) work-to-rest ratio; (d) effective playing time; and (d) strokes per rally. Significant differences (p<0.05) were found between serving and returning conditions in an hour-long simulated singles tennis match in terms of oxygen uptake, a heart rate, ratings of perceived exertion, pulmonary ventilation, respiration frequency and a respiratory gas exchange ratio. In addition, both the heart rate and ratings of perceived exertion responses were moderately correlated with the duration of rallies and strokes per rally (r = 0.60 to 0.26; p<0.05). Taken together, these results indicate that the serve game situation has a significant effect on the physiological response in an hour-long simulated tennis match between professional male tennis players. These findings might be used for the physiological adaptations required for tennis-specific aerobic endurance. © Editorial Committee of Journal of Human Kinetics 2016.",doi,10.1515/hukin-2015-0173,Scopus,Journal of Human Kinetics,"Kilit B., Şenel O., Arslan E., Can S.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Pilot Trial Of Spirometer Games For Airway Clearance Practice In Cystic Fibrosis,"BACKGROUND: Many children with cystic fibrosis (CF) adhere poorly to airway clearance techniques (ACTs), and would rather play video games that challenge their dexterity and visual tracking skills. We developed gaming technology that encourages forced expiratory maneuvers. OBJECTIVE: Following interviews regarding recreational activities and subjects' practice of ACTs, we conducted a pilot trial of spirometer games in 13 adolescents with CF, to test the hypothesis that games could increase subjects' engagement with forced expiratory breathing maneuvers and improve pulmonary function tests (PFTs). METHODS: After baseline PFTs, subjects were provided with digital spirometers and computers set up as ""game only"" or ""control"" devices. After the first of 2 periods (each &gt; 2 weeks), the computer was set-up for the alternate condition for period 2. The t test and non-parametric correlation analyses examined use, number of expiratory high flow events (HFEs), and change in PFTs, identifying trends at P &lt; 1, significance at P &lt; 05. RESULTS: Interviews disclosed minimal awareness of ACTs among our pediatric CF patients. Subjects used games and control software a similar percentage of days during the game (26%) and control periods (32%). There was a trend toward more minutes with the game versus control setup (P = 07), though HFE count did not differ between the 2 conditions (P = 71). Game play showed no overall effect on FEV1, though correlation analysis showed a modest relation between minutes of play and change in FEV1 from baseline (r = 0.50, P = 09). The game period showed a trend to increased vital capacity (P = 05). CONCLUSIONS: Spirometer games elicit forced expiratory breath maneuvers in pediatric CF patients. Improvement in PFTs may be due to improved test performance technique, though improved obstructive/restrictive lung function due to game play cannot be excluded. A formal clinical trial of this approach is planned. © 2012 Daedalus Enterprises.",doi,10.4187/respcare.01263,Scopus,Respiratory Care,"Bingham P.M., Lahiri T., Ashikaga T.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Playing Active Video Games Increases Energy Expenditure In Children,"OBJECTIVE: To compare energy expenditure rates in children playing the physically active video games, Dance Dance Revolution (DDR) and Nintendo's Wii Sports in relation to treadmill walking. METHODS: Energy expenditure, heart rate, step rate, and perceived exertion were measured in 14 boys and 9 girls (ages 10-13 years; BMI at 3-98th percentile for age and gender) while watching television at rest, playing DDR at 2 skill levels, playing Wii bowling and boxing, and walking at 2.6, 4.2, and 5.7 km/h. Arterial elasticity was measured at rest and immediately after gaming. RESULTS: Compared with watching television, energy expenditure while gaming or walking increased 2-to 3-fold. Similarly, high rates of energy expenditure, heart rate, and perceived exertion were elicited from playing Wii boxing, DDR level 2, or walking at 5.7 km/h. This occurred despite variations in step rate among activities, reflecting greater use of upper body during Wii play (lowest step rate) than during walking (highest step rate) or DDR play. Wii bowling and beginner level DDR elicited a 2-fold increase in energy expenditure compared to television watching. Large-artery elasticity declined immediately after both DDR and Wii. The change was inversely related to the increment in energy expenditure above rest achieved during the activity. CONCLUSIONS: Energy expenditure during active video game play is comparable to moderate-intensity walking. Thus, for children who spend considerable time playing electronic screen games for entertainment, physically active games seem to be a safe, fun, and valuable means of promoting energy expenditure.

,"Political Ideology, Exploration Of Novel Stimuli, And Attitude Formation","In this study, the relations among political ideology, exploratory behavior, and the formation of attitudes toward novel stimuli were explored. Participants played a computer game that required learning whether these stimuli produced positive or negative outcomes. Learning was dependent on participants' decisions to sample novel stimuli and discover the associated valence. Political ideology correlated with exploration during the game, with conservatives sampling fewer targets than liberals. Moreover, more conservative individuals exhibited a stronger learning asymmetry, such that they learned negative stimuli better than positive. Mediational analyses revealed that the differences in learning were due to the extent of exploratory behavior during the game. Relative to liberals, politically conservative individuals pursued a more avoidant strategy to the game, which led to their development of a more pronounced valence asymmetry in learning and attitude formation. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

,Positive Preferences: The Emotional Valence Of What An Avatar Says Matters,"This study examined preferences and ascriptions of human control for avatars associated with positive and negative language. An avatar is a graphical representation of an individual user in a virtual world. Users form judgments of other virtual world users based on the appearance and behavior of their avatars in the absence of physical cues. In particular, users have previously displayed sensitivity toward anthropomorphism and verbal behavior of avatars they encounter within virtual environments. Thus far, investigations of language in online and virtual spaces have been limited to specific contexts. University student participants and Amazon Mechanical Turk workers were shown two avatars. Each pair consisted of two out of three possible appearances: a tiger, a male, or a female. Each avatar was aligned with a different text introduction: one containing words of positive emotional valence and the other of negative emotional valence. Participants from both samples preferred avatars associated with positive language, regardless of appearance, but participants did not ascribe human control of an avatar based on either emotional valance or appearance. Significant differences for reported preferences and likeability demonstrate the salience of emotive language as a social cue even in short text introductions for avatars. These findings suggest that those we like and want to be around in virtual environments might not necessarily align with whom we view as human. © Copyright 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2017.",doi,10.1089/cyber.2016.0374,Scopus,"Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking","Wu J., Kraemer P.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Predicting Ambulatory Blood Pressure During School: Effectiveness Of Social And Nonsocial Reactivity Tasks In Black And White Adolescents,"We evaluated a newly developed stress task, the Social Competence Interview, and three nonsocial tasks (video game, mirror drawing, mental arithmetic) for ability to predict ambulatory blood pressure in 237 black and white adolescents. Blood pressure was measured in laboratory, classroom, and transition (between‐class) settings. A resting laboratory baseline explained 10–49% of the variance in ambulatory blood pressure levels; the ability of the stress tasks to explain additional variance was assessed in multiple regression analyses. Only the blood pressure response to the interview enhanced prediction of classroom and transition systolic and diastolic pressures in the total sample and in blacks, whites, females, and males – even when the interview data were entered into a hierarchical regression model after those for the other three tasks were entered. Mirror drawing improved prediction of transition systolic blood pressure in the total sample, and mental arithmetic plus the interview improved prediction of classroom diastolic pressure in black males; however, video game failed to enter any predictive equation. Racial subgroup analyses disclosed that the interview data predicted systolic pressure in whites but predicted diastolic pressure in blacks, indicating biological differences in blood pressure regulation. An interview that elicits characteristic thoughts and social behaviors appears to represent a promising approach to examining environmental influences on blood pressure.

,Predicting Home And Work Blood Pressure Measurements From Resting Baselines And Laboratory Reactivity In Black And White Americans,"The relationship between blood pressure in the laboratory (both at rest and in response to laboratory tasks) and ambulatory blood pressure at home and at work was evaluated. One hundred nineteen normotensive and unmedicated mild‐moderate hypertensive black and white females and males participated in laboratory blood pressure monitoring at rest and during four challenging tasks (structured interview, video game, bicycle exercise, and cold pressor test) as well as ambulatory blood pressure monitoring while at home and at work. Baseline blood pressure taken while subjects were at rest was the strongest predictor of ambulatory systolic blood pressure (r=.64) and diastolic blood pressure (r=.77) at work. Among reactivity tasks the strongest predictors of ambulatory blood pressure in the total population were the structured interview and the video game (both psychological tasks) followed by the cold pressor test. Racial comparisons, however, determined that the cold pressor test predicted diastolic blood pressure significantly better for blacks (r=.73) than for whites (r=.40), suggesting a possible difference in blood pressure regulation.

,Predictive Cloud Computing With Big Data: Professional Golf And Tennis Forecasting [Application Notes],"Major Golf and Grand Slam Tennis tournaments such as Australian Open, The Masters, Roland Garros, United States Golf Association (USGA), Wimbledon, and United States Tennis Association (USTA) United States (US) Open provide real-time and historical sporting information to immerse a global fan base in the action. Each tournament provides realtime content, including streaming video, game statistics, scores, images, schedule of play, and text. Due to the game popularities, some of the web servers are heavily visited and some are not, therefore, we need a method to autonomously provision servers to provide a smooth user experience. Predictive Cloud Computing (PCC) has been developed to provide a smart allocation/deallocation of servers by combining ensembles of forecasts and predictive modeling to determine the future origin demand for web site content. PCC distributes processing through analytical pipelines that correlate streaming data, such as scores, media schedules, and player brackets with a future-siμlated tournament state to measure predicted demand spikes for content. Social data streamed from Twitter provides social sentiment and popularity features used within predictive modeling. Data at rest, such as machine logs and web content, provide additional features for forecasting. While the duration of each tournament varies, the number of origin website requests range from 29,000 to 110,000 hits per minute. The PCC technology was developed and deployed to all Grand Slam tennis events and several major golf tournaments that took place in 2013 and to the present, which has decreased wasted computing consumption by over 50%. We propose a novel forecasting ensemble that includes residual, vector, historical, partial, adjusted, cubic and quadratic forecasters. In addition, we present several predictive models based on μltiple Regression as inputs into several of these forecasters. We conclude by empirically demonstrating that the predictive cloud technology is able to forecast the computing load on origin web servers for professional golf and tennis tournaments. © 2005-2012 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/MCI.2015.2437551,Scopus,IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine,"Baughman A.K., Bogdany R.J., McAvoy C., Locke R., O'Connell B., Upton C.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,"Pressor Reactivity, Ethnicity, And 24-Hour Ambulatory Monitoring In Children From Hypertensive Families","We assessed blood pressure responses of a multiethnic (Black and White) sample of 120 children of hypertensive families to orthostasis, video game, forehead cold, and dynamic exercise, and monitored the children’s ambulatory pressure 24 hours later. Thirteen children were studied twice (1-year stability). The Black children exhibited higher 24-hour ambulatory systolic and diastolic pressures than the White children. Regardless of ethnicity, peak and mean systolic pressures during each task were generally positively correlated with mean systolic pressure while the children were awake and asleep. Associations between diastolic pressor responses and ambulatory measurements were somewhat dependent upon ethnicity and task. Relatively few reactivity-ambulatory correlations were significant, using pressor reactivity change scores. The children who participated twice exhibited significant 1-year stability for most ambulatory and pressor measurements. Children’s pressor responses to laboratory tasks may generalize to the natural environment. © 1994 College health All right reserved.",doi,10.1080/08964289.1994.9934628,Scopus,Behavioral Medicine,"Treiber F.A., Murphy J.K., Davis H., Austin Raunikar R., Pflieger K., Strong W.B.",1994,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Prevalence Of Risk For Type 2 Diabetes In School Children,"According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1 in 3 children born in 2000 in the United States will become diabetic. The odds are higher for African American and Hispanic children as nearly 50% of them will develop diabetes. Random screening is not effective in identifying children at risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM); therefore, there is a need to apply screening strategies that guide the development of appropriate primary prevention efforts. To assess the prevalence of risk factors for T2DM, 1066 fifth-grade children were screened using American Diabetes Association guidelines. Overall, 22.6% were found at risk; African American and Hispanic children were almost 8 times more likely to be at risk when compared to Caucasians (odds ratio = 7.41 and 7.87). Children who reported watching TV/playing video games 2 or more hours/day were 73% more likely to be at risk. Children identified to be at risk were referred to their primary care provider and were invited to participate in a counseling session. The environmental risk factors for T2DM identified in this study are modifiable and should be targeted in preventive interventions at the school and community level to reduce overweight and consequently prevent T2DM in children, especially among minority children. © 2006, American School Health Association.",doi,10.1111/j.1746-1561.2006.00093.x,Scopus,Journal of School Health,"Urrutia-Rojas X., Menchaca J.",2006,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas

To implement this scenario on real UAVs and UGVs, we propose a distributed hierarchical hybrid system architecture which emphasizes the autonomy of each agent, yet allows for coordinated team efforts. We describe the implementation of the architecture on a fleet of UAVs and UGVs, detailing components such as high-level pursuit policy computation, map building and interagent communication, and low-level navigation, sensing, and control.

,Processes Underlying Congruent And Incongruent Facial Reactions To Emotional Facial Expressions,"The present electromyographic study is a first step toward shedding light on the involvement of affective processes in congruent and incongruent facial reactions to facial expressions. Further, empathy was investigated as a potential mediator underlying the modulation of facial reactions to emotional faces in a competitive, a cooperative, and a neutral setting. Results revealed less congruent reactions to happy expressions and even incongruent reactions to sad and angry expressions in the competition condition, whereas virtually no differences between the neutral and the cooperation condition occurred. Effects on congruent reactions were found to be mediated by cognitive empathy, indicating that the state of empathy plays an important role in the situational modulation of congruent reactions. Further, incongruent reactions to sad and angry faces in a competition setting were mediated by the emotional reaction of joy, supporting the assumption that incongruent facial reactions are mainly based on affective processes. Additionally, strategic processes (specifically, the goal to create and maintain a smooth, harmonious interaction) were found to influence facial reactions while being in a cooperative mindset. Now, further studies are needed to test for the generalizability of these effects. © 2011 American Psychological Association.",doi,10.1037/a0023162,Scopus,Emotion,"Likowski K.U., Mühlberger A., Seibt B., Pauli P., Weyers P.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Product Placement In Video Games: Image Transference Among Emotions,"Organizations look for new ways of communication as traditional media is being saturated with advertising messages. One of the alternatives is product placement in video games. This chapter analyses this new communication alternative. Moreover, through an investigation the chapter shows the consequences of placing a brand in this form of electronic entertainment -in the sense of image transfer from the video game to the brand. Specifically, this chapter focuses on the emotions evoked by the video game. Therefore, the present study develops a scale of emotions adapted to the theme of this research. Additionally, this study analyses the differences between types of product placement and their effects in the image transfer. All conclusions are extracted from the concept map technique. © 2015 by IGI Global.

,Protocols From Perceptual Observations,"This paper presents a cognitive vision system capable of autonomously learning protocols from perceptual observations of dynamic scenes. The work is motivated by the aim of creating a synthetic agent that can observe a scene containing interactions between unknown objects and agents, and learn models of these sufficient to act in accordance with the implicit protocols present in the scene. Discrete concepts (utterances and object properties), and temporal protocols involving these concepts, are learned in an unsupervised manner from continuous sensor input alone. Crucial to this learning process are methods for spatio-temporal attention applied to the audio and visual sensor data. These identify subsets of the sensor data relating to discrete concepts. Clustering within continuous feature spaces is used to learn object property and utterance models from processed sensor data, forming a symbolic description. The progol Inductive Logic Programming system is subsequently used to learn symbolic models of the temporal protocols presented in the presence of noise and over-representation in the symbolic data input to it. The models learned are used to drive a synthetic agent that can interact with the world in a semi-natural way. The system has been evaluated in the domain of table-top game playing and has been shown to be successful at learning protocol behaviours in such real-world audio-visual environments. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

,Psychological And Physiological Responses To Stereoscopic 3D Presentation In Handheld Digital Gaming: Comparing The Experiences Of Frequent And Infrequent Game Players,"Recent advances in commercial gaming technology include stereoscopic 3D presentation. This experiment employed a mixed factorial design to explore the effects of game display format (2D; 3D), frequency of game play (weekly; non-weekly), and participant gender (male; female) on feelings of presence and arousal among participants playing a handheld racing video game. Responses to display format were moderated by frequency of game play, with stereoscopic 3D presentation eliciting reduced presence and increased arousal among weekly game players, but the reverse pattern among non-weekly game players. Theoretical and practical implications of the moderating role of game play frequency in effects of 3D presentation are discussed. © 2015 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",doi,10.1162/PRES_a_00204,Scopus,Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments,"Limperos A., Franklin Waddell T., Ivory A.H., Ivory J.D.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas

,Q(Λ)-Learning Adaptive Fuzzy Logic Controllers For Pursuit-Evasion Differential Games,"This paper addresses the problem of tuning the input and the output parameters of a fuzzy logic controller. A novel technique that combines Q(λ)-learning with function approximation (fuzzy inference system) is proposed. The system learns autonomously without supervision or a priori training data. The proposed technique is applied to three different pursuit-evasion differential games. The proposed technique is compared with the classical control strategy, Q(λ)-learning only, and the technique proposed by Dai et al. (2005) in which a neural network is used as a function approximation for Q-learning. Computer simulations show the usefulness of the proposed technique.

,Quantifying Direct And Indirect Effects Of Perturbations Using Model Ecosystems,"Indirect effects in ecosystems in response to perturbations remain a topic of much discussion. We continue on the theoretical path set by Nakajima and Higashi (1995, Indirect effects in ecological interaction networks (II): the conjugate variable approach. Mathematical Biosciences 130, 129-150) and extend their approach for quantifying indirect effects of press perturbations under steady-state conditions to pulse perturbations in steady state and to press and pulse perturbations under time-varying conditions. We illustrate with a commonly used lake ecosystem model how to estimate total, direct, and indirect effects on one species' biomass (e.g., game fish) from perturbations to a second species (e.g., forage fish). We use the daily output of species biomasses from multi-year model simulations to test whether the computed total, direct, and indirect effects are equal for pulse and press perturbations of equal magnitude, and whether the types (pulse and press) and timing of perturbations alter the relative importance of indirect effects. Our results were consistent with the original theory of Nakajima and Higashi; under steady-state conditions, press and pulse perturbations to the forage fish produced similar effects on the game fish. Under these same conditions, indirect effects on the game fish were more than 3.5 times larger than the direct effects. Under time-varying conditions, all classes of pulse effects, but not press, depended on the day the perturbation was imposed. Indirect effects of pulse and press perturbations under time-varying conditions were always negative (offsetting) and of similar magnitude as the direct effects. When forage fish biomass was growing rapidly, the indirect effect on game fish biomass of a pulse perturbation was relatively smaller compared to the direct effect, whereas the indirect and direct effects were similar at other times. We consider the general implications of these results for the analysis of natural ecosystems. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",doi,10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2013.12.017,Scopus,Ecological Modelling,"Burns T.P., Rose K.A., Brenkert A.L.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Race And Cardiovascular Reactivity: A Replication,"In a previous study, we reported that black children demonstrated greater cardiovascular reactivity than did white children to the psychological stress of a television video game. Reliance on urban volunteers and the wide age range of the children may have limited conclusions concerning the generalizability of those results. In the present study, 481 of 484 children enrolled in the third grade of the public schools of an entire rural county in Tennessee were examined with the same video game procedure used previously. Results indicated greater heart rate and blood pressure reactivity among black children than among white children. Thus, the previous results were replicated. The greater prevalence of hypertension among black adults may relate to the greater reactivity among black children; reactivity may be either a marker or a mechanism in the development of hypertension.",doi,10.1161/01.HYP.11.4.308,Scopus,Hypertension,"Murphy J.K., Alpert B.S., Walker S.S., Willey E.S.",1988,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Race/Ethnicity Determines The Relationships Between Oxidative Stress Markers And Blood Pressure In Individuals With High Cardiovascular Disease Risk,"Oxidative stress (OS) and cardiovascular (CV) reactivity are related to CV morbidity and mortality. However, little is known about the relationships between these CV risk factors and their confounders. We hypothesize that higher OS is linked to higher blood pressure (BP) reactivity to acute laboratory stressors and in the natural setting. We studied 137 subjects with a family history of hypertension and early myocardial infarction. There were 63 European Americans (EAs) (38 males) and 74 African Americans (AAs) (35 males), aged 19-36 (27.6±3.1). The protocol included a competitive video game, cold stressor and ambulatory BP recording. Blood samples were drawn six times for OS markers (8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and 8-Isoprostane) assay. Repeated measures analyses of covariance were used to test for mean differences and Pearson correlations were used to test OS and BP associations. There were no significant race/ethnicity differences in BP reactivity to either stressor (both P's>0.48). 8-OHdG levels were significantly lower across all time points for AAs than for EAs (P<0.05), while levels of 8-isoprostane did not differ significantly (P>0.10). Averaged 8-OHdG levels significantly correlated with systolic blood pressure (SBP) reactivity (r=0.45, <0.01) and 24-h, daytime and nighttime SBP (r range=0.37-0.42, all P's<0.02) for EAs but not for AAs, whereas 8-isoprostane levels were significantly correlated with reactive SBP and nighttime diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (both r's=0.38, P<0.01) for AAs but not for EAs. These findings suggest a link between OS and BP changes in subjects at high risk for CV disease (CVD). Further, race/ethnicity determines which OS marker will impact BP variation implying race/ethnicity differences in OS-related mechanisms of CVD.",doi,10.1038/jhh.2016.39,Scopus,Journal of Human Hypertension,"Kapuku G., Treiber F., Raouane F., Halbert J., Davis H., Young-Mayes S., Robinson V., Harshfield G.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Rapid Habituation Of Ventral Striatal Response To Reward Receipt In Postpartum Depression,"Background: Little is known about neural mechanisms of postpartum depression (PPD). Previous research notes ventral striatal activity and dopamine release increases with maternal attachment but decreases in major depressive disorder. This study tests the hypothesis that striatal response to reward is altered in PPD. Methods: Subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging blood oxygenation level-dependent acquisition during a fast event-related card-guessing, monetary reward task. Time series data from an independent sample of 10 healthy mothers were used to establish the ventral striatal region of interest (ROI). Repeated-measures analysis of variance of time series data in the established ROI was then conducted for a discrete group of healthy (n = 12) and depressed, unmedicated mothers (n = 12). Results: Data from the independent sample of 10 healthy mothers established an ROI in the left ventral striatum (-13, 12, -4, 477 mm 3), with cluster significance p &lt;.01, corrected. There was a significant quadratic interaction of time × group [F(1,22) = 5.22, p =.032] in this ROI in the healthy (n = 12) and depressed mothers (n = 12). This effect represents a nonlinear attenuation of ventral striatal response with time that was greater in depressed than healthy mothers. Conclusions: Rapid attenuation of ventral striatal response to reward receipt in postpartum depression might represent an important neural mechanism of postpartum depression. Additional study with infant stimuli and in relationship to motherinfant behavior is needed. © 2011 Society of Biological Psychiatry.",doi,10.1016/j.biopsych.2011.02.021,Scopus,Biological Psychiatry,"Moses-Kolko E.L., Fraser D., Wisner K.L., James J.A., Saul A.T., Fiez J.A., Phillips M.L.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Rating Electronic Games: Violence Is In The Eye Of The Beholder.,"Commercial ratings assist parents in monitoring their children's media experiences. Exposure to media violence may affect attitudes and behavior, and rating systems should accurately reflect the presence of violent content. Validity indicators for commercial rating systems are examined, including consistency with consumer perceptions. Violent electronic games are a contemporary media phenomenon. A comparison of commercial ratings for popular electronic games with consumer perceptions of game content indicates that, for games with obviously nonviolent or very violent content, there is agreement between consumers and the commercial system. However, there is considerable disagreement about notable violent content in games with cartoon-type violence. Recommendations include incorporating consumer perceptions into a comprehensive, content-based, informational rating system for all entertainment media.",doi,10.1177/0044118X99030003002,anderson2010,Youth & Society,"Funk, J.

,Real-Time Emotion Retrieval Scheme In Video With Image Sequence Features,"In the current Internet environment, a lot of multimedia information is navigated on the on-line computer systems. Among the multimedia information, video sequence has the most valuable and meaningful influence on human emotions. Therefore, one human's emotions to see and feel the same video can be different from that of others depending on the person's mental state. In this research, we propose a new real-time emotion retrieval scheme in video with image sequence features. The features of image sequence consist of color information, key frame extraction, video sound, and optical flow. Each video feature is combined with the weight for the emotion retrieval. The experimental results show the new approach of real-time emotion retrieval in video with the better results compared to the previous studies. The proposed scheme will be applied to the many multimedia fields: movie, computer game, video conference, and so on. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",doi,10.1007/s11554-013-0366-x,Scopus,Journal of Real-Time Image Processing,"Chang J.-K., Ryoo S.-T.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,"Realistic Facial Expression Of Virtual Human Based On Color, Sweat, And Tears Effects","Generating extreme appearances such as scared awaiting sweating while happy fit for tears (cry) and blushing (anger and happiness) is the key issue in achieving the high quality facial animation. The effects of sweat, tears, and colors are integrated into a single animation model to create realistic facial expressions of 3D avatar. The physical properties of muscles, emotions, or the fluid properties with sweating and tears initiators are incorporated. The action units (AUs) of facial action coding system are merged with autonomous AUs to create expressions including sadness, anger with blushing, happiness with blushing, and fear. Fluid effects such as sweat and tears are simulated using the particle system and smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) methods which are combined with facial animation technique to produce complex facial expressions. The effects of oxygenation of the facial skin color appearance are measured using the pulse oximeter system and the 3D skin analyzer. The result shows that virtual human facial expression is enhanced by mimicking actual sweating and tears simulations for all extreme expressions. The proposed method has contribution towards the development of facial animation industry and game as well as computer graphics. © 2014 Mohammed Hazim Alkawaz et al.",doi,10.1155/2014/367013,Scopus,Scientific World Journal,"Alkawaz M.H., Basori A.H., Mohamad D., Mohamed F.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Reducing Heart Rate Reactivity To Stress With Feedback Generalization Across Task And Time,"Heart rate (HR) reactions to two behavioral stressors (videogame and mental arithmetic) were measured in 8 experimental subjects who received biofeedback training and 8 matched control subjects during three assessment periods: pretraining, posttraining, and one-week follow-up. Experimental subjects exhibited significant reductions in HR following a training session in which they received ongoing HR feedback while playing a videogame. Control subjects, who played the same number of videogames without HR feedback, showed smaller HR reductions. During the training session, all subjects were instructed to reduce HR while maximizing game perlormance. In comparison to controls, experimental subjects (a) maintained lower HRs during videogame presentations after a one-week period and (b) generalized these HR reductions to the mental arithmetic challenge at follow-up. Performance on the videogame declined from post-training to follow-up for experimental subjects but not for control subjects. No group difference in mental arithmetic performance was observed. © 1992, SAGE PUBLICATIONS, INC..

,Rehabilitation Of Face-Processing Skills In An Adolescent With Prosopagnosia: Evaluation Of An Online Perceptual Training Programme,"In this paper we describe the case of EM, a female adolescent who acquired prosopagnosia following encephalitis at the age of eight. Initial neuropsychological and eye-movement investigations indicated that EM had profound difficulties in face perception as well as face recognition. EM underwent 14weeks of perceptual training in an online programme that attempted to improve her ability to make fine-grained discriminations between faces. Following training, EM's face perception skills had improved, and the effect generalised to untrained faces. Eye-movement analyses also indicated that EM spent more time viewing the inner facial features post-training. Examination of EM's face recognition skills revealed an improvement in her recognition of personally-known faces when presented in a laboratory-based test, although the same gains were not noted in her everyday experiences with these faces. In addition, EM did not improve on a test assessing the recognition of newly encoded faces. One month after training, EM had maintained the improvement on the eye-tracking test, and to a lesser extent, her performance on the familiar faces test. This pattern of findings is interpreted as promising evidence that the programme can improve face perception skills, and with some adjustments, may at least partially improve face recognition skills. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",doi,10.1080/09602011.2014.973886,Scopus,Neuropsychological Rehabilitation,"Bate S., Bennetts R., Mole J.A., Ainge J.A., Gregory N.J., Bobak A.K., Bussunt A.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Reliability Of Cardiovascular Reactivity To Stress: Internal Consistency,"Research on the reliability of cardiovascular reactivity has focused on temporal stability and intertask consistency with only modest results. The present study evaluated the internal consistency reliability of cardiovascular reactivity in three large samples of adolescents and young adults (N=326, 136, and 142). Impedance cardiographic and blood pressure measures were recorded at rest and during standard laboratory stress tasks (math, video game, cold pressor). The reliability of cardiovascular reactivity within tasks, as assessed by Cronbach's α coefficient of internal consistency, ranged from α=.83 to.96 for 4-min to 5-min math tasks, and α=.65 to.94 for 3-min video game and cold pressor tasks. Although highly reliable within tasks, cardiovascular reactivity was less reliable across tasks, even within a single testing session. Possible reasons for the discrepancy between internal consistency and intertask consistency are discussed.

,"Reliability Of Physical, Physiological And Tactical Measures In Small-Sided Soccer Games With Numerical Equality And Numerical Superiority [Confiabilidade Das Medidas De Demanda Física, Fisiológica E Tática Em Pequenos Jogos Com Superioridade E Igualdade Numérica No Futebol]","The aim of this study was to investigate the physical, physiological (HR) and tactical demands of small-sided soccer games (SSG) with numerical equality (3x3) and numerical superiority (4x3). Eighteen male players of a soccer team played against each other both types of SSG, both played as two 4-minute bouts interspersed with 4-minute rest. Physical (distances, velocities and accelerations) and HR demands were recorded by a GPS system (15hz) and a heart rate monitor during SSG. The individual tactical behaviors proposed by the System of Tactical Assessment in Soccer were registered by an observer who analyzed the SSG videos. Reliability was verified calculating the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and the absolute and percentage standard error of measurement (SEM and %SEM, respectively), both considering athletes’ individual scores in each SSG bout. As a result, higher number of variables related to physical and physiological demands presented significant ICC values, being classified as moderate to excellent in relation to variables related to tactical demands. Considering these variables that presented significant ICC values in both SSG, the SEM% values found for physical and physiological variables ranged from 3.0 to 42.0%, while those found for the tactical variables ranged from 31.6 to 75.0%. It could be concluded that several variables related to physical and physiological demands present moderate to excellent reliability. Differently, the majority of variables related to tactical demands were not reliable in both types of SSG. © 2016, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina.

,Renal Trauma After Blunt Abdominal Injury,"AbstractBackground The kidney is the third most common solid organ injury in blunt abdominal trauma. The preferred treatment of blunt kidney injury varies according to grade of severity, with a preference for non-operative management in most instances. Discussion We examine an unusual case of blunt renal trauma. In this case, our patient presented with severe flank pain and hematuria after a game of softball. Our focused abdominal sonography for trauma revealed fluid in the splenorenal recess concerning for intra-abdominal injury, and subsequent abdominal computed tomography confirmed a grade IV kidney laceration. Conclusion Our patient was managed medically despite his high grade of injury. This article reviews the diagnosis and management of blunt renal trauma and highlights the fact that despite significant injury, a patient can go on to do well with conservative management alone. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",doi,10.1016/j.jemermed.2013.03.043,Scopus,Journal of Emergency Medicine,"Harper K., Shah K.H.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas

,Representing Emotive Meaning In Visual Images: A Social Semiotic Approach,"This study examines how emotive meaning is represented in visual images using the semiotic resources of facial expression, touch and body orientation. Complementing the cognitive metaphorical interpretation, the visually represented emotive behaviors are theorized as partial iconic representations of real life behaviors, which are in turn indexes of emotion. Adopting a social semiotic approach, this paper formulates facial expression, touch, and body orientation as inter-related systems of meaning, the selection and combination of which constitutes a systemic functional ""lexico-grammar"" for analyzing and interpreting meaning making in visual imagery. The systems are then used to explain how emotive meanings are represented in comic books. The analysis shows that cartoonists' systemic choices for representing emotions are largely consistent with the coding accuracy of facial behaviors on the one hand, and style guidelines advocated in comic handbooks on the other. Through the examination of both American and Japanese comics, it is demonstrated that the social semiotic lexico-grammatical approach is not only effective in explaining the emotion resources in nonverbal behavior, but also useful for investigating cultural differences in the visual depiction of emotion. The systemic choices also provide artists with a framework to ""design"" emotion in creative visual media such as comics, and possibly in computer vision, game design and related domains. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",doi,10.1016/j.pragma.2012.10.003,Scopus,Journal of Pragmatics,"Feng D., O'Halloran K.L.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Requirements For And Impact Of A Serious Game For Neuro-Pediatric Robot-Assisted Gait Training,"We investigated whether children with neurological gait disorders who walked in a driven gait orthosis could adjust their participation level according to the demands of a newly developed rehabilitation game. We further investigated if cognitive capacity and motor impairment influenced game performance. Nineteen children with neurological gait disorders (mean age: 13.4y, 42% girls) participated. To quantify game participation, electromyographic muscle activity (M. rectus femoris) and heart rate were compared in a demanding part and a less demanding part of the game. Cognitive capacity was assessed with the Test of Nonverbal Intelligence (TONI-4). Furthermore, the Functional Independence Measure for Children (WeeFIM), Manual Muscle Tests and a therapist-derived score of how well the child was able to train were assessed. Results showed that muscle activity and heart rate were higher during the demanding part of the game (30.7. ±. 22.6. μV; 129.4. ±. 15.7. bpm) compared to the less demanding part (16.0. ±. 13.4. μV; 124.1. ±. 15.9. bpm; p<. 0.01 for both measures). Game performance correlated moderately with the TONI-4 (r= 0.50, p = 0.04) and the cognition subscale of the WeeFIM (ρ= 0.59, p= 0.01). The therapist-derived score correlated significantly with game performance (p= 0.75, p<. 0.01) and the ability to modify muscle activity to the demands of the game (p= -0.72, p<. 0.01). Receiver operating characteristic analyses revealed that the latter factor differentiated well between those children suitable for the game and those not. We conclude that children with neurological gait disorders are able to modify their activity to the demands of the VR-scenario. However, cognitive function and motor impairment determine to which extent. These results are important for clinical decision-making. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.ridd.2013.07.031,Scopus,Research in Developmental Disabilities,"Labruyère R., Gerber C.N., Birrer-Brütsch K., Meyer-Heim A., van Hedel H.J.A.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Reward And Punishment Hyposensitivity In Problem Gamblers: A Study Of Event-Related Potentials Using A Principal Components Analysis,"Objective: To investigate whether the latent neural correlates of incentive processing differ between problem gamblers (PGs) and healthy controls (HCs). Methods: Event-related potential (ERP) data were derived while 16 PGs and 20 HCs played a computer electronic gaming machine (EGM) task. Psychophysiological responses to outcomes commonly encountered during EGM gambling, including Large wins, Small wins, Near-wins, and Losses, were examined using a spatiotemporal principal components analysis (PCA). Subjects also completed questionnaires that assessed their levels of impulsivity, attraction to appetitive stimuli, and avoidance of aversive stimuli. Results: Losses elicited a feedback-related negativity (FRN), whereas wins elicited a feedback-related positivity (FRP) at the same latency and topography. PGs exhibited both attenuated FRN amplitudes following Losses and FRP amplitudes following Wins. Greater P3b amplitudes were found following Wins compared to Losses. FRN amplitudes following Near-wins were significantly reduced compared to Losses for both PGs and HCs. Trends for reduced P3b amplitudes following all outcome types, and for similar P3b amplitudes following Large and Small wins, were found for the PG group. Conclusions: We provide evidence that PGs are hyposensitive to both positive and negative outcomes. Significance: The finding that PGs are hyposensitive to reward and punishment provides valuable insight into the nature of deficit in this disorder, and provides a foundation for future research and clinical interventions. © 2014 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.",doi,10.1016/j.clinph.2014.10.011,Scopus,Clinical Neurophysiology,"Lole L., Gonsalvez C.J., Barry R.J.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Reward Anticipation In The Adolescent And Aging Brain,"Processing of reward is the basis of adaptive behavior of the human being. Neural correlates of reward processing seem to be influenced by developmental changes from adolescence to late adulthood. The aim of this study is to uncover these neural correlates during a slot machine gambling task across the lifespan. Therefore, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate 102 volunteers in three different age groups: 34 adolescents, 34 younger adults, and 34 older adults. We focused on the core reward areas ventral striatum (VS) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), the valence processing associated areas, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and insula, as well as information integration associated areas, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and inferior parietal lobule (IPL). Results showed that VS and VMPFC were characterized by a hyperactivation in adolescents compared with younger adults. Furthermore, the ACC and insula were characterized by a U-shape pattern (hypoactivation in younger adults compared with adolescents and older adults), whereas the DLPFC and IPL were characterized by a J-shaped form (hyperactivation in older adults compared with younger groups). Furthermore, a functional connectivity analysis revealed an elevated negative functional coupling between the inhibition-related area rIFG and VS in younger adults compared with adolescents. Results indicate that lifespan-related changes during reward anticipation are characterized by different trajectories in different reward network modules and support the hypothesis of an imbalance in maturation of striatal and prefrontal cortex in adolescents. Furthermore, these results suggest compensatory age-specific effects in fronto-parietal regions. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",doi,10.1002/hbm.22540,Scopus,Human Brain Mapping,"Lorenz R.C., Gleich T., Beck A., Pöhland L., Raufelder D., Sommer W., Rapp M.A., Kühn S., Gallinat J.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,"Salivary Alpha Amylase And Cortisol Responses To Different Stress Tasks : Impact Of Sex. International Journal Of Psychophysiology, 69, 33–40.","Neuro-endocrine markers such as salivary alpha amylase (sAA) and cortisol (CORT) play an important role in establishing human responses to stressful events. Whereas sAA levels reflect sympathetic system activity, salivary cortisol appears to be a valid measure for HPA axis activity. Although many studies looked at either sAA or CORT responses in reaction to stress, work still has to be done to look at the way these systems interact, especially when both systems are activated. Additionally, sex effects in CORT responses have been investigated relatively often, but possible sex differences in sAA levels and responses, or the way both systems interact has not been the focus of sufficient studies to yield a univocal conclusion. In this study we presented a group of healthy participants (n=80) with two mildly stressful tasks, consisting of an aversive picture rating task and a cold pressor stress (CPS) task. The second task was compared with a control task. We expected a rise in sAA level in response to the first task and sAA as well as CORT responses on the second task and explored the interaction between the two responses. Results indicate that sAA is indeed a sensitive marker in both psychologically and physically induced arousal paradigms, whereas a cortisol response was only observed in the CPS task. Men had higher sAA levels than women during the complete course of the study, but men and women were comparable in their responsivity to the tasks.

,Screen Violence And Youth Behavior,"Violence in screen entertainment media (ie, television, film, video games, and the Internet), defined as depictions of characters (or players) trying to physically harm other characters (or players), is ubiquitous. The Workgroup on Media Violence and Violent Video Games reviewed numerous meta-analyses and other relevant research from the past 60 years, with an emphasis on violent video game research. Consistent with every major science organization review, the Workgroup found compelling evidence of short-term harmful effects, as well as evidence of long-term harmful effects. The vast majority of laboratory-based experimental studies have revealed that violent media exposure causes increased aggressive thoughts, angry feelings, physiologic arousal, hostile appraisals, aggressive behavior, and desensitization to violence and decreases prosocial behavior (eg, helping others) and empathy. Still, to more fully understand the potential for long-term harm from media violence exposure, the field is greatly in need of additional large-sample, high-quality, longitudinal studies that include validated measures of media violence exposure and measures of other known violence risk factors. Also, although several high-quality media violence intervention studies have been conducted, larger-scale studies with more comprehensive and longer-term assessments are needed to fully understand long-term effects and to inform the development of tools that will help to reduce problems associated with aggression and violence. The evidence that violent screen media constitutes a causal risk factor for increased aggression is compelling. Modern social-cognitive theories of social behavior provide useful frameworks for understanding how and why these effects occur.

,Seeing The World Through Mortal Kombat-Colored Glasses: Violent Video Games And The Development Of A Short-Term Hostile Attribution Bias.,"This study investigated the effects of playing violent vs non-violent video games on the interpretation of ambiguous provocation situations. The participants played either a very violent video game or a relatively non-violent video game for several minutes. Children were then read five stories in which a same-sex peer caused a clearly negative event to happen but where the peer's intent was ambiguous. After each story, children were asked a series of questions about the peer's intent, subsequent actions and potential punishment. Responses were coded in terms of amount of negative and violent content. Results indicated that children playing the violent video game responded more negatively on three of the six ambiguous provocation story questions than children playing the non-violent video game. These data suggest that playing violent video games leads to the development of a hostile attribution bias.",doi,10.1177/0907568298005002005,anderson2010,Childhood,"Kirsh, S.

,Self-Evaluation Of Rts Troop’s Performance,"This paper demonstrates the research results obtained from a comparison of Evolutionary Programming (EP) and hybrid Differential Evolution (DE) and Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN) algorithms in the Real Time Strategy (RTS) computer game, namely Warcraft III. The main aims of this research are to: test the feasibility of implementing EP and hybrid DE into RTS game, compare the performances of EP and hybrid DE, and generate gaming RTS controllers autonomously, an issue primarily of reinforcement/troops balancing. This micromanagement issue has been overlooked since last decade. Experimental results demonstrate success with all aims: both EP and hybrid DE could be implemented into the Warcraft III platform, and both algorithms used able to generate optimal solutions. © 2015 Penerbit UTM Press.

,Self-Reported Screen Time And Cardiometabolic Risk In Obese Dutch Adolescents,"Background: It is not clear whether the association between sedentary time and cardiometabolic risk exists among obese adolescents. We examined the association between screen time (TV and computer time) and cardiometabolic risk in obese Dutch adolescents. Methods and Findings: For the current cross-sectional study, baseline data of 125 Dutch overweight and obese adolescents (12-18 years) participating in the Go4it study were included. Self-reported screen time (Activity Questionnaire for Adolescents and Adults) and clustered and individual cardiometabolic risk (i.e. body composition, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, low-density (LDL-C), high-density (HDL-C) and total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides, glucose and insulin) were assessed in all participants. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to assess the association between screen time and cardiometabolic risk, adjusting for age, gender, pubertal stage, ethnicity and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. We found no significant relationship between self-reported total screen time and clustered cardiometabolic risk or individual risk factors in overweight and obese adolescents. Unexpectedly, self-reported computer time, but not TV time, was slightly but significantly inversely associated with TC (B = -0.002; CI = [-0.003;-0.000]) and LDL-C (B = -0.002; CI = [-0.001;0.000]). Conclusions: In obese adolescents we could not confirm the hypothesised positive association between screen time and cardiometabolic risk. Future studies should consider computer use as a separate class of screen behaviour, thereby also discriminating between active video gaming and other computer activities. © 2012 Altenburg et al.",doi,10.1371/journal.pone.0053333,Scopus,PLoS ONE,"Altenburg T.M., Hofsteenge G.H., Weijs P.J.M., Delemarre-van de Waal H.A., Chinapaw M.J.M.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Sensitivity Analysis Of Surface Ozone To Emission Controls In Beijing And Its Neighboring Area During The 2008 Olympic Games,"The regional air quality modeling system RAMS (Regional Atmospheric Modeling System)-CMAQ (Community Multi-scale Air Quality modeling system) is applied to analyze temporal and spatial variations in surface ozone concentration over Beijing and its surrounding region from July to October 2008. Comparison of simulated and observed meteorological elements and concentration of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and ozone at one urban site and three rural sites during Olympic Games show that model can generally reproduce the main observed feature of wind, temperature and ozone, but NOx concentration is overestimated. Although ozone concentration decreased during Olympics, high ozone episodes occurred on 24 July and 24 August with concentration of 360 and 245 μg/m 3 at Aoyuncun site, respectively. The analysis of sensitive test, with and without emission controls, shows that emission controls could reduce ozone concentration in the afternoon when ozone concentration was highest but increase it at night and in the morning. The evolution of the weather system during the ozone episodes (24 July and 24 August) indicates that hot and dry air and a stable weak pressure field intensified the production of ozone and allowed it to accumulate. Process analysis at the urban site and rural site shows that under favorable weather condition on 24 August, horizontal transport was the main contributor of the rural place and the pollution from the higher layer would be transported to the surface layer. On 24 July, as the wind velocity was smaller, the impact of transport on the rural place was not obvious. © 2012 The Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.",doi,10.1016/S1001-0742(11)60728-6,Scopus,Journal of Environmental Sciences,"Gao Y., Zhang M.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Serious Games For Teaching Conflict Resolution: Modeling Conflict Dynamics,"Serious games have already found use in several non-leisure contexts including simulation, training, health and education. In this study we present a serious game designed for the purpose of enhancing the ability of children between the ages of 9 and 12 to cope with conflict situations. Inspired by theoretical models of human conflict and experiential learning, we designed a game through which players experience and try to resolve conflict situations themselves in a virtual environment. In our multiplayer game, Village Voices, each child plays the role of a villager and is asked to complete a number of conflict quests that require social interaction and resource management; the game allows anything from very aggressive behaviours (stealing resources and spreading negative rumors) to collaborative play (trading resources). To model conflict intensity in Village Voices and evaluate its ability to elicit strong emotions and conflict, we ran a game user survey in Portugal from 32 children. Data collected include demographic information and conflict profile types, as well as in-game behavioural data and self-reported notions of conflict and affect during play. The analysis presented in this paper shows that there appear to be strong effects between gender, age, conflict resolution strategy type, cultural tendency, reported emotions and perception about the other players, and reported conflict intensity. Indeed, Village Voices serves as an excellent vehicle for teaching conflict resolution as it is able to elicit bounded conflict situations of varying intensities, and, importantly, enables us to further understand conflict dynamics amongst students of this age group and beyond. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",doi,10.1007/978-3-319-14081-0_21,Scopus,Conflict and Multimodal Communication: Social Research and Machine Intelligence,"Cheong Y.-G., Khaled R., HolmgȦrd C., Yannakakis G.N.",2015,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Serious Games To Teach Social Interactions And Emotions To Individuals With Autism Spectrum Disorders (Asd),"The use of information communication technologies (ICTs) in therapy offers new perspectives for treating many domains in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) because they can be used in many different ways and settings and they are attractive to the patients. We reviewed the available literature on serious games that are used to teach social interactions to individuals with ASD. After screening the Medline, Science Direct and ACM Digital Library databases, we found a total of 31 serious games: 16 that targeted emotion recognition or production and 15 that targeted social skills. There was a significant correlation between the number of reports per year and the year of publication. Serious games appeared promising because they can support training on many different skills and they favour interactions in diverse contexts and situations, some of which may resemble real life. However, the currently available serious games exhibit some limitations: (i) most of them are developed for High-Functioning individuals; (ii) their clinical validation has rarely met the evidence-based medicine standards; (iii) the game design is not usually described; and, (iv) in many cases, the clinical validation and playability/game design are not compatible. Future research agendas should encompass (i) more robust studies in terms of methodology (large samples, control groups, longer treatment periods, follow-up to assess whether changes remain stable, etc.) to assess serious game efficacy; (ii) more collaboration between clinical and computer/game design experts; and (iii) more serious games that are adapted to Low-Functioning ASD individuals. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",doi,10.1016/j.compedu.2017.05.002,Scopus,Computers and Education,"Grossard C., Grynspan O., Serret S., Jouen A.-L., Bailly K., Cohen D.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Set-Up Games: A Heuristic Game-Theoretic Approach To Set-Up Decisions For Hierarchical Manufacturing Systems,"Heterarchical control systems have emerged as promising alternatives to conventional centralized and hierarchical shop floor control systems. However, research to date has largely ignored long-term control issues such as the timing of resource reconfigurations, which are vital for the avoidance of myopic decision-making. As traditional analysis techniques implicitly assume centralized analysis and implementation of policies, they are not directly applicable to heterarchical environments. A non-cooperative game-theoretic planning technique for autonomous analyses of reconfiguration decisions by heterarchical machine controllers is described. Under the proposed system, a machine controller evaluates a set-up game to determine appropriate actions when faced with a sequence-independent reconfiguration decision. The prescribed action is defined by a pure or mixed-strategy equilibrium of the set-up game. By evaluating a game, the machine controller accounts for the potential actions and reactions of other machine controllers in the system. The approach allows the autonomous machine controller to make set-up decisions about future actions while preserving the independence characteristic of controllers in heterarchical environments.",doi,10.1080/00207540410001708452,Scopus,International Journal of Production Research,"Mcdonnell P., Joshi S., Qiu R.G.",2004,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Simulation Study On Opinion Formation Models Of Heterogeneous Agents Based On Game Theory And Complex Networks,"This study investigates a new opinion formation model of heterogeneous agents, a network stubborn individuals and orators (NSO) model based on game theory and complex social networks. Game theory solves economists' rational choice-making problems, and complex social networks reflect the social impact on opinion evolution. The NSO model involves both social and individual heterogeneous characteristics. In a society, the more unequal the members, and the closer the social distances, the faster opinions spread. In the real world, the power-law degree distribution and the short paths in social networks can generate the rapid spread of an opinion. This study also investigates opinion control under the NSO model. The results show that opinion guidance is most likely to separate the public into different groups rather than converge to the guide's opinion. © 2017 Author(s).",doi,10.1177/0037549717709349,Scopus,Simulation,"Li Y., Cao H., Wen G.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Situated Action Approach To Implementing Characters In Computer Games,"Computer games are moving in the direction of more dramatic content. Characters in computer games are becoming more autonomous and are increasingly required to display purposeful and emotional behavior and to appear to understand the situation. An alternative to simulating their mental state is to portray it just as a human actor portrays a character. Situated action provides a theoretical basis for understanding how to do this with quite simple agents. In this article we describe a way of organizing systems of interacting agents and a corresponding agent architecture and implementation technology, all based on situated action, and then report our experience of applying this technology to the production of an agentbased game embedded in a published CD-i title. © 1996 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",doi,10.1080/088395196118687,Scopus,Applied Artificial Intelligence,Wavish P.,1996,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas

,Social Exclusion: More Important To Human Females Than Males,"Theoretical models based on primate evidence suggest that social structure determines the costs and benefits of particular aggressive strategies. In humans, males more than females interact in groups of unrelated same-sex peers, and larger group size predicts success in inter-group contests. In marked contrast, human females form isolated one-on-one relationships with fewer instrumental benefits, so social exclusion constitutes a more useful strategy. If this model is accurate, then human social exclusion should be utilized by females more than males and females should be more sensitive to its occurrence. Here we present four studies supporting this model. In Study 1, using a computerized game with fictitious opponents, we demonstrate that females are more willing than males to socially exclude a temporary ally. In Study 2, females report more actual incidents of social exclusion than males do. In Study 3, females perceive cues revealing social exclusion more rapidly than males do. Finally, in Study 4, females' heart rate increases more than males' in response to social exclusion. Together, results indicate that social exclusion is a strategy well-tailored to human females' social structure. © 2013 Benenson et al.",doi,10.1371/journal.pone.0055851,Scopus,PLoS ONE,"Benenson J.F., Markovits H., Hultgren B., Nguyen T., Bullock G., Wrangham R.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Story Immersion May Be Effective In Promoting Diet And Physical Activity In Chinese Children,"Objective To evaluate the effect of playing a health video game embedded with story immersion, Escape from Diab (Diab), on children's diet and physical activity (PA) and to explore whether children immersed in Diab had greater positive outcomes. Design Two groups, nonrandomized; 3 outcome assessments: at baseline, immediately after the game (post 1), and 8–10 weeks after the game (post 2). Participants A total of 179 Chinese children aged 8–12 years. Intervention The treatment group played Diab; the control group received no intervention. Main Outcome Measures Motivation; self-efficacy; preference for fruit, vegetables, water, and PA; as well as PA behavior. Analysis Adjusted changes to post 1 and post 2 by ANCOVA controlling for demographic and baseline variables. Results Children who played Diab had increased intrinsic motivation for fruit and water, self-efficacy for PA, and self-reported PA scores at post 1 (all P < .05). Children with higher immersion scores (above the median) had increased intrinsic motivation for fruit and water, and autonomous and controlled motivation for PA at post 1 (all P < .05). However, these were not significant at post 2. Conclusions and Implications Diab provides a promising innovative medium for promoting Chinese children's psychological correlates of diet and PA and PA behavior. However, its maintenance of effectiveness needs to be enhanced and mechanisms of change need to be investigated more thoroughly. © 2017 Society for Nutrition Education and Behavior",doi,10.1016/j.jneb.2017.01.001,Scopus,Journal of Nutrition Education and Behavior,"Wang J.J., Baranowski T., Lau P.W.C., Buday R., Gao Y.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Strength Of Affective Reaction As A Signal To Think Carefully,"Analytic processes reduce biases, but it is not known how or when these processes will be deployed. Based on an affective signal hypothesis, relatively strong affective reactions were expected to result in increased analytic processing and reduced bias in judgement. The valence and strength of affective reactions were manipulated through varying outcomes in a game or evaluative conditioning of a stimulus. Relatively strong positive or negative affective reactions resulted in less desirability bias. Bias reduction only occurred if participants had time to deploy analytic processes and indicators of the degree of analytic processing (in the form of attentional control) predicted less bias. Affective processes have long been acknowledged as a source of bias, but these findings suggest affective processes are also integral to bias reduction. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",doi,10.1080/02699931.2014.904223,Scopus,Cognition and Emotion,"Lench H.C., Bench S.W.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Stress Reduces Diastolic Function In Youth,"Objective: Research regarding the influence of mental stress (MS) on heart function focused primarily on heart contractility. We hypothesized that MS results in attenuated diastolic function (DF) as early as in adolescence and this effect may differ by race and sex. Methods: 161 normotensive adolescents (81 blacks and 80 females) performed resting (control) and MS (experimental) conditions on separate visits. Visits lasted for 3 hours (1-hour rest, video game challenge and recovery for experimental visit. Mitral inflow early (E) to late (A) filling velocities (E/A) ratio; mitral valve annular early velocity (E′) and E/E′ ratio were recorded every 30 minutes to evaluate DF. Results: BP and HR increased during experimental visit (all p values < .01). E/A ratio progressively increased during control visit (mean [SE], from 1.93 ± 0.42 to 2.01 ± 0.47) but decreased during the stress phase of experimental visit (from 1.91 ± 0.44 to 1.87 ± 0.50, p interaction < .001). In white males, E′ increased from rest to stress phase (from 10.3 ± 2.55 to 10.7 ± 2.28 cm/s), whereas E′ decreased in white females (from 11.0 ± 2.62 to 10.6 ± 2.53 cm/s), black males (from 10.5 ± 2.31 to 9.9 ± 2.19 cm/s), and black females (from 10.6 ± 2.22 to 10.3 ± 1.86 cm/s, p interaction < .04). During stress, higher A was associated with higher E/E′ ratio. Conclusions: Recurrent episodes of mental stress may increase the risk of poor DF, and these adverse effects may be stronger in females and black males. © 2012 by the American Psychosomatic Society.",doi,10.1097/PSY.0b013e31825b920b,Scopus,Psychosomatic Medicine,"Kapuku G.K., Davis H., Murdison K., Robinson V., Harshfield G.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,"Stressful Gaming, Interoceptive Awareness, And Emotion Regulation Tendencies: A Novel Approach","Healthy emotion regulation is crucial for navigating stressful situations. Interoceptive awareness - the awareness of one's internal states - is important for such healthy regulation. Given the propensity for video games to induce stress, the associations between in-game and real world emotion regulation strategies during duress are worth exploring. We therefore present a method for measuring the interoceptive awareness of negative affect during stressful video game play, and investigate whether individual differences in this ability relate to emotion regulation strategies. Twenty-six proficient video game players were recruited to play a session of the video game Starcraft II in the lab. Players' physiological and subjective states of in-game negative arousal were measured consecutively. A comparison of these measures was used to calculate players' interoceptive awareness of real time in-game arousal. The relation between interoceptive awareness and a suite of emotion regulation strategies was then investigated. We observed a positive relation between in-game interoceptive awareness and the self-reported tendency to actively seek a resolution to negative affect. A positive trend was also observed between interoceptive awareness and the self-reported tendency to seek instrumental social support. Findings are discussed in terms of the relative effectiveness of different emotion regulation strategies for aiding in-game success. We further discuss the benefits and limitations of this pilot testing. In all, we hope to inspire future research into the associations between in-game arousal and emotion regulation strategies used in everyday life. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",doi,10.1089/cyber.2013.0296,Scopus,"Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking","Lobel A., Granic I., Engels R.C.M.E.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas

,Subdivision-Based Corridor Map Method For Path Planning,"One of the most significant challenges in autonomous robotics/ gaming is to find an optimal collision-free path in an environment with obstacles. Numerous path planning methods exist for problems in a static or a dynamic environment, known or unknown environment. Recently, a general framework called the corridor map method has been introduced for generating a real-time, high-quality path applicable in a static and known environment. This approach works in two phases-a construction phase and a query phase. In the construction phase a system of collision-free corridors is created with respect to static obstacles in the environment. In the query phase, a path is determined between a given starting point and a goal inside the corridor. In the present paper, we propose a novel approach for finding a smooth and short path using the subdivision curves. The proposed method has three main advantages: (i) computation of the current position of a moving object does not involve an integration process; (ii) depending upon the clearance information, the subdivision process automatically increases/decreases the velocity of a moving object; and (iii) shorter paths can be generated using the same process by appropriately choosing the levels of iteration in the subdivision method.",doi,10.2316/Journal.206.2013.4.206-3702,Scopus,International Journal of Robotics and Automation,"Kumar A., Ojha A.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas

,Sympathetic Indices During Psychological And Physical Stimuli Before And After Training,"The effects of psychological and physical stimuli on cardiovascular and catecholamine changes were studied before and after physical training. These functions were investigated in eight labile hypertensive men in response to the mild psychological stimulus of playing a video game and the mild physical stimuli of sitting and standing. The results show that plasma norepinephrine concentration rises with sitting and standing but plasma epinephrine concentration increases only with the psychological stimulus. Physical training was associated with smaller increases in blood pressure during psychological and physical stimuli and with a lower heart rate at rest. On the other hand, plasma catecholamines at rest as well as in response to the different stimuli were unchanged following moderate training. These observations suggest that the adrenal medulla is selectively activated during a period of mild psychological stress, while the activity of the sympathetic fibers is preferentially increased during mild physical stimuli. Furthermore, the results of this study show that plasma catecholamine levels at rest and their increase during various stimuli are unchanged following training. © 1985.",doi,10.1016/0031-9384(85)90349-X,Scopus,Physiology and Behavior,"Cleroux J., Peronnet F., de Champlain J.",1985,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Tactile Defensiveness In Children With Developmental Disabilities: Responsiveness And Habituation,"Tactile defensiveness (TD) is characterized by behaviors such as rubbing, scratching, negative expressions, withdrawal, or avoidance in response to tactile stimulation. An inhibition deficit has been implied in the literature and is the focus of this study. School-aged children with developmental disabilities were first assessed for level of TD using three measures. Later, the children were presented with a repeated tactile stimulus while engaged in a computer game. Intensity, duration, and latency of the responses were recorded on each trial. It was hypothesized that higher levels of TD would be associated with (a) greater responsiveness and (b) slower habituation rates to the tactile stimulus. Correlations of three separate TD measures and a series of 3×10 (Level of TD by Responsiveness across trials) repeated measures ANOVAs were used to test the two hypotheses. Children who demonstrated higher levels of TD on some of the preliminary measures also showed higher responsiveness in the experimental situation. There was no general habituation effect, and the limited group by trials interactions were not interpretable. We concluded that there is evidence for a differential sensitivity in TD, but not an inhibition deficit. Another significant finding included a negative correlation between TD and developmental age. © 1994 Plenum Publishing Corporation.",doi,10.1007/BF02172128,Scopus,Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders,"Baranek G.T., Berkson G.",1994,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Talking About Interest: Exploring The Role Of Social Interaction For Regulating Motivation And The Interest Experience,"The Self-Regulation of Motivation Model suggests that the experience of interest is an important source of human motivation and that people often strategically regulate the experience of interest. Previous work based on this model suggests that the social context may influence this process at multiple points. The present research focuses on whether talking to others about an activity experience is one means by which individuals evaluate how interesting that activity is. In Study 1 college students completed questionnaires that asked about real life experiences where working on an activity was more interesting because they worked with others. They described experiences that occurred first in any domain, and then that occurred specifically in the school domain. Results suggested that the more students talked with others about the activity after it happened the more they reported greater interest in the activity after the conversations. In the school domain, this was especially true for Latinos and for individuals who scored higher on the Relational Self-Construal scale. Study 2 employed a lab paradigm to control for the task that individuals talked to others about and to examine whether the nature of listeners' reactions influenced the speaker's interest even after the study was ostensibly over. First, replicating Pasupathi and Rich (2005, 'Inattentive listening undermines self-verification in personal storytelling', Journal of Personality 73, pp. 1051-1086) college students who talked to a distracted friend about a computer game during the lab session reported a significant drop in interest relative to those who talked to attentive friends, regardless of whether the attentive listeners agreed or disagreed with participants. Importantly, interest ratings at a 4-6 week follow-up were affected by the perceived responsiveness of listeners during spontaneous conversational retellings outside the lab, controlling for interest levels at the end of the lab session. Taken together, results suggest that social interaction plays an important role in regulating activity interest even beyond the immediate activity experience. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",doi,10.1007/s10902-006-9016-3,Scopus,Journal of Happiness Studies,"Thoman D.B., Sansone C., Pasupathi M.",2007,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Technical And Physical Demands Of Small Vs. Large Sided Games In Relation To Playing Position In Elite Soccer,"The aim of this investigation was to compare the effects of common rule changes on technical and physical demands for elite soccer players in five playing positions during various 4-min small-sided games (SSGs) in comparison to 11-a-side matches. Forty international players classified into five positional roles participated in the study (25.3 ± 2.4. years, 182.4 ± 2.3. cm, 77.3 ± 4.1. kg; M ± SD). Players completed three different conditioned small-sided 4 vs. 4 games (1 ball touch. =1T, 2 ball touches. =2T and Free Play. =FP) as well as two friendly matches. Heart rate (HR), blood lactate ([La]), ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) as well as physical and technical performance were analyzed. Compared to match-play, total distance covered per minute of play, high-intensity running activities (sprinting and high-intensity runs), total numbers of duels and lost ball possessions were significantly greater within SSGs for all playing positions (p<. .05). In contrast, [La], percentage of successful passes and number of ball possessions were lower (p<. .05) within SSGs, particularly with 1T and 2T rules, in comparison with match-play. HR was higher in SSGs compared to match-play for all playing positions, and RPE values were lower (p<. .05) during the FP SSG for defensive midfielders, wide midfielders and forwards. In conclusion, this study revealed that 4 vs. 4 SSGs played with 1 or 2 ball touches increased the high-intensity running and the difficulty to perform technical actions, being more specific to match demands. Subsequently, it is of importance for coaches to understand the different physiological demands imposed upon players by varying the rules of SSGs and to understand the differences between positional roles. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",doi,10.1016/j.humov.2011.08.013,Scopus,Human Movement Science,"Dellal A., Owen A., Wong D.P., Krustrup P., van Exsel M., Mallo J.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Temporal Consistency Of Individual Differences In Cardiac Response To A Video Game,"Three experiments are reported which examined the temporal stability of cardiac reactions to a video game of the 'space invaders' genre. Experiment 1 also addressed the matter of inter-task consistency; in addition to the video game, subjects were presented with an unsignalled reaction time task and led to believe that relatively quick reactions attracted financial reward, while slower ones brought either a burst of loud noise or withdrawal of money previously earned. Forty-two male subjects were tested on both tasks on two occasions, a week apart. Of the two tasks, the video game elicited the greater reactivity. In addition, individual variations in reactivity showed striking temporal stability for both tasks. However, inter-task consistency was much less marked; in fact, a significant inter-task correlation was obtained only on the first occasion of testing. It is probable that limited consistency here was in some measure due to the ineffectiveness of our reaction time task in eliciting substantial reactivity. Finally, reactivity was independent of baseline heart rate level. In experiment 2, three extreme high and three extreme low cardiac reactors were selected from an initial sample of 23 male subjects, on the basis of reactivity during an initial session with the video game, and subsequently studied during four further sessions. Once more, impressive stability of heart rate reactivity was apparent over sessions. In experiment 3, we examined the reliability of individual variations in cardiac reactivity in women and the issue of whether temporal stability is constrained by menstrual cycle effects. Twenty-four females were tested on the video game both preovulatory and postovulatory, with half being tested first during the preovulatory phase and half being tested first during the postovulatory phase. Again, the most striking finding was the marked stability of individual variations in cardiac reactivity over both time and menstrual cycle phase. © 1984.",doi,10.1016/0301-0511(84)90048-6,Scopus,Biological Psychology,"Carroll D., Turner J.R., Lee H.J., Stephenson J.",1984,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Testing The Prosocial Effectiveness Of The Prototypical Moral Emotions: Elevation Increases Benevolent Behaviors And Outrage Increases Justice Behaviors,"How can we overcome apathy and instigate a desire to help others? This research tests and compares the prosocial effects of two of the most prototypical emotions on a range of prosocial intentions and behaviors. Emotion-inducing videos were used to instigate states of moral elevation (felt when witnessing a moral virtue) and/or moral outrage (felt when witnessing a moral transgression). Although elevation and outrage are derived from opposing appraisals, separate strands of research show that they both instigate a desire to help others. The current research tests the appraisal tendency framework to explore whether elevation and outrage increase prosociality across moral domains or whether their prosocial effects are domain specific. Results of Experiment 1 showed that elevation, but not outrage, increased donations to charity (i.e., benevolence domain). Experiment 2 showed that outrage, but not elevation, increased prosocial political action intentions (i.e., justice domain). Experiment 3 showed that outrage, but not elevation, increased compensation in a third-party bystander game (i.e., justice domain). This research shows that although elevation and outrage both inspire a desire to help others, they affect distinct types of prosocial behaviors, offering support for the appraisal tendency framework. Applied and theoretical implications are discussed. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",doi,10.1016/j.jesp.2014.12.005,Scopus,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,"Van de Vyver J., Abrams D.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas

,"The Activity Intensities Reached When Playing Active Tennis Gaming Relative To Sedentary Gaming, Tennis Game-Play, And Current Activity Recommendations In Young Adults","Scanlan, AT, Arkinstall, H, Dalbo, VJ, Humphries, BJ, Jennings, CT, and Kingsley, MIC. The activity intensities reached when playing active tennis gaming relative to sedentary gaming, tennis game-play, and current activity recommendations in young adults. J Strength Cond Res 27(9): 2588-2595, 2013- Although active gaming is popular and can increase energy expenditure in young adults, its efficacy as a prescriptive exercise tool is not well understood. This study aimed to: (a) compare the activity intensities experienced by young adults while playing active tennis gaming with conventional sedentary gaming, tennis game-play, and current activity recommendations for health; and (b) identify changes in activity intensities across playing time. After habitualization, 10 active young adults (age: 20.2 ± 0.4 years; stature: 1.74 ± 0.03 m; body mass: 67.7 ± 3.3 kg) completed 3 experimental trials (sedentary gaming, active tennis gaming, and tennis game-play) on separate days in a randomized order. Heart rate (HR) and metabolic equivalents (METs) were averaged across 5 minutes and 10 minutes intervals, and the entire 20 minutes bout within each condition. Active gaming produced greater intensities across 5-10, 10-15, and 15-20 minutes time intervals compared with sedentary gaming (p &lt; 0.01). Tennis game-play elicited greater HR (67 ± 5% HRmax) and METs (5.0 ± 0.2) responses than both sedentary (40 ± 2% HRmax, 1.1 ± 0.1 METs) and active gaming (45 ± 2% HRmax, 1.4 ± 0.1 METs) (p &lt; 0.001). Only tennis game-play produced activity intensities meeting current recommendations for health benefit. Lower HR intensities were reached across 0-5 minutes than during later time intervals during active gaming (6%) and tennis game-play (9%) (p &lt; 0.01). Activity intensities elicited by active gaming were greater than sedentary gaming but less than tennis game-play and insufficient to contribute toward promoting and maintaining good health in young adults. These data suggest that active tennis gaming should not be recommended by exercise professionals as a substitute for actual sports participation in young adults. © 2013 National Strength and Conditioning Association.",doi,10.1519/JSC.0b013e31827f523e,Scopus,Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research,"Scanlan A.T., Arkinstall H., Dalbo V.J., Humphries B.J., Jennings C.T., Kingsley M.I.C.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,The Association Between Chronic Exposure To Video Game Violence And Affective Picture Processing: An Erp Study,"Exposure to video game violence (VGV) is known to result in desensitization to violent material and may alter the processing of positive emotion related to facial expressions. The present study was designed to address three questions: (1) Does the association between VGV and positive emotion extend to stimuli other than faces, (2) is the association between VGV and affective picture processing observed with a single presentation of the stimuli, and (3) is the association between VGV and the response to violent stimuli sensitive to the relevance of emotion for task performance? The data revealed that transient modulations of the event-related potentials (ERPs) related to attentional orienting and sustained modulations of the ERPs related to evaluative processing were sensitive to VGV exposure. © 2011 Psychonomic Society, Inc.",doi,10.3758/s13415-011-0029-y,Scopus,"Cognitive, Affective and Behavioral Neuroscience","Bailey K., West R., Anderson C.A.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,The Cardiovascular Effects Of Nicotine During Stress,"The acute cardiovascular effects of smoking during stress may be greater than those of smoking or stress alone, a finding which could have implications for determining which smokers may be at particular risk for coronary heart disease (CHD). Methodological problems inherent in using tobacco smoking to deliver nicotine (believed responsible for smoking's cardiovascular effects) prevent clear examination of the cardiovascular effects of inhaled nicotine. This study compared the cardiovascular increases due to a video game stress task plus 1.0 mg nicotine with those of stress or nicotine alone using an aerosol method of presenting nicotine in measured doses. Twelve young male smokers each participated in four conditions on 4 separate days: stress + nicotine, stress + placebo (stress alone), rest + nicotine (nicotine alone), and rest + placebo. The effects of stress and nicotine were additive for heart rate but less than additive for systolic and diastolic blood pressure. These results indicate that the combined effects of stress and nicotine may be relevant to understanding the prevalence of CHD among smokers. They also suggest that the effects of each on cardiovascular activity may be different, as the effects are independent for heart rate but overlap for blood pressure. © 1986 Springer-Verlag.",doi,10.1007/BF00179194,Scopus,Psychopharmacology,"Perkins K.A., Epstein L.H., Jennings J.R., Stiller R.",1986,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,The Contribution Of Upper Limb And Total Body Movement To Adolescents' Energy Expenditure Whilst Playing Nintendo Wii,"Little research documents the contribution of upper limb and total body movement to energy expenditure (EE) during active video gaming. To address this, EE, heart rate (HR), and, upper limb and total body movement were assessed in 11- to 17-year-old adolescents whilst playing three active (Nintendo Wii) and one sedentary (XBOX 360) video games. Non-dominant upper limb activity, EE and HR were significantly greater during Wii Sports boxing [mean 267.2 (SD 115.8) J kg-1 min-1; 136.7 (24.5) beats min-1] than tennis or bowling (P ≤ 0.044). For all active games hip activity best predicted EE (R2 ≥ 0.53), with two-measure models of HR and single-site activity data, and multi-site activity data, similarly explaining the variance in EE (R2 ≥ 0.64). The physiological cost of upper-body orientated active video games increased when movement of both upper limbs was encouraged. Improvements in EE explanatory power provide support for multi-site activity monitoring during unique, non-ambulatory activities. © Springer-Verlag 2008.",doi,10.1007/s00421-008-0813-8,Scopus,European Journal of Applied Physiology,"Graves L.E.F., Ridgers N.D., Stratton G.",2008,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,The Design Of Emotionally Engaging Products,"Dennis Wixon, a member of Microsoft Game Studios, has offered his views on the design of emotionally engaging products and the research tools needed to create them. The different types of design includes mechanics, dynamics, and aesthetics. Mechanics are the goals and rules of the game, while the dynamics is what the user brings such as experience and knowledge to the game. Dynamics then gives rise to aesthetics, which focuses on what the user concludes about the game. This model, called the Jamesian bodily feedback model, in consistency with the James-Lange theory shows that behavior leads to judgments or conclusions, among which are emotions. This approach helps avoid a classic philosophical error that most psychologists and many people in general often make. This approach also urges researchers and designers to think in the most concrete and specific terms. OXO products, which follows this approach, are designed to be touched to feel good when using them.",doi,10.1145/1288515.1288531,Scopus,Interactions,"Wixon D., De Los Reyes A.",2007,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,The Differential Effects Of Agency On Fear Induction Using A Horror-Themed Video Game,"Fear research faces a dilemma as typical methods of induction elicit passive or indirect fear, rather than authentic or direct fear. The present study investigated and compared the effects of interactivity, or agency, on the physiological responses of participants as measures of direct fear as they either played or watched a horror-themed video game. Assuming agency allows for greater immersion, the former group would exhibit greater physiological responses, possibly indicating greater fear reaction. Change scores were calculated from subtracting baseline mean values from exposure mean values for every participant in measures of electrodermal activity (EDA), respiratory rate (RR), and heart rate (HR). Self-reported fear data was also gathered for every participant. Players had a significantly greater increase than watchers in EDA, RR, and HR change scores. Players and watchers did not differ significantly in self-reported fear. Change score t tests for specific events that occur in the video game are also reported. These results suggest that the variable of agency may have had the effect of inducing a greater fear response and that it provides utility for researchers seeking to ethically induce direct fear. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.chb.2015.11.041,Scopus,Computers in Human Behavior,Madsen K.E.,2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,The Effect Of Attentional Load On The Breathing Pattern In Children,"Experiments designed to establish the effects of video games on breathing patterns have led to contradictory results. Several authors reported that video games tended to increase breathing frequency (i.e. to reduce breath duration), whereas others reported the opposite. We postulated that video games contain different psychophysiological components which may have opposite effects on breathing pattern. On the one hand, arousal and emotion may tend to stimulate breathing. On the other, focusing attention on the game may prompt subject to inhibit any movement - including breathing - which might be a potential nuisance variable. The aim of this study was to assess the specific effects of the attentional load in an experimental environment characterized by its low emotional impact. We measured breathing variables, cardiac frequency and cortisol levels in 10 healthy children (mean age = 9.2 ±: 1.5 years) who were familiar with the environment, the experimenter and the video game. Breath duration rose significantly, from 2.56 to 3.16 s, as a function of game difficulty. Cortisol levels, heart rate and the thoracic contribution to breathing displayed no significant changes. Taken together, these data suggest that focusing attention on the game tended to inhibit breathing and that previous contradictory reports in this respect were due to the confounding effects of emotion.",doi,10.1016/S0167-8760(97)00086-X,Scopus,International Journal of Psychophysiology,"Denot-Ledunois S., Vardon G., Perruchet P., Gallego J.",1998,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,The Effect Of Distance On Moral Engagement: Event Related Potentials And Alpha Power Are Sensitive To Perspective In A Virtual Shooting Task,"In a shooting video game we investigated whether increased distance reduces moral conflict. We measured and analyzed the event related potential (ERP), including the N2 component, which has previously been linked to cognitive conflict from competing decision tendencies. In a modified Go/No-go task designed to trigger moral conflict participants had to shoot suddenly appearing human like avatars in a virtual reality scene. The scene was seen either from an ego perspective with targets appearing directly in front of the participant or from a bird's view, where targets were seen from above and more distant. To control for low level visual features, we added a visually identical control condition, where the instruction to ""shoot"" was replaced by an instruction to ""detect."" ERP waveforms showed differences between the two tasks as early as in the N1 time-range, with higher N1 amplitudes for the close perspective in the ""shoot"" task. Additionally, we found that pre-stimulus alpha power was significantly decreased in the ego, compared to the bird's view only for the ""shoot"" but not for the ""detect"" task. In the N2 time window, we observed main amplitude effects for response (No-go > Go) and distance (ego > bird perspective) but no interaction with task type (shoot vs. detect). We argue that the pre-stimulus and N1 effects can be explained by reduced attention and arousal in the distance condition when people are instructed to ""shoot."" These results indicate a reduced moral engagement for increased distance. The lack of interaction in the N2 across tasks suggests that at that time point response execution dominates. We discuss potential implications for real life shooting situations, especially considering recent developments in drone shootings which are per definition of a distant view. © 2016 Petras, ten Oever and Jansma.",doi,10.3389/fpsyg.2015.02008,Scopus,Frontiers in Psychology,"Petras K., Oever S.T., Jansma B.M.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,The Effect Of Repeated Exposure To Virtual Gambling Cues On The Urge To Gamble,"Introduction: This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of using a virtual reality (VR) casino environment in cue exposure therapy (CET) for gambling. The main objective of this study was to assess the ability of five VR casino cues to elicit subjective reactions and physiological responses that can be used within the CET paradigm. A second objective was to analyze changes in participants' urge to gamble after repeated exposure to a VR casino program and relaxation training. Methods: Twelve recreational gamblers were exposed to five virtual environments with casino-related cues that reproduced typical gambling situations. Self-reported subjective urges and psychophysiological responses were recorded during exposure. Results: All virtual environments with casino-related cues generated craving in recreational gamblers, whereas no increase in the psychophysiological variables was observed. In addition, urges to gamble elicited by VR casino environment reduced through repeated exposure and relaxation training. Conclusion: These findings provide evidence of the effectiveness of VR for simulating casino environments in the treatment of gambling. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.addbeh.2014.09.027,Scopus,Addictive Behaviors,"Park C.-B., Park S.M., Gwak A.R., Sohn B.K., Lee J.-Y., Jung H.Y., Choi S.-W., Kim D.J., Choi J.-S.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,The Effects Of An Action Video Game On Visual And Affective Information Processing,"Playing action video games can have beneficial effects on visuospatial cognition and negative effects on social information processing. However, these two effects have not been demonstrated in the same individuals in a single study. The current study used event-related brain potentials (ERPs) to examine the effects of playing an action or non-action video game on the processing of emotion in facial expression. The data revealed that 10 h of playing an action or non-action video game had differential effects on the ERPs relative to a no-contact control group. Playing an action game resulted in two effects: one that reflected an increase in the amplitude of the ERPs following training over the right frontal and posterior regions that was similar for angry, happy, and neutral faces; and one that reflected a reduction in the allocation of attention to happy faces. In contrast, playing a non-action game resulted in changes in slow wave activity over the central-parietal and frontal regions that were greater for targets (i.e., angry and happy faces) than for non-targets (i.e., neutral faces). These data demonstrate that the contrasting effects of action video games on visuospatial and emotion processing occur in the same individuals following the same level of gaming experience. This observation leads to the suggestion that caution should be exercised when using action video games to modify visual processing, as this experience could also have unintended effects on emotion processing. © 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.",doi,10.1016/j.brainres.2013.02.019,Scopus,Brain Research,"Bailey K., West R.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,The Effects Of Coping Style On Virtual Reality Enhanced Videogame Distraction In Children Undergoing Cold Pressor Pain,"This study sought to evaluate the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR) enhanced interactive videogame distraction for children undergoing experimentally induced cold pressor pain and examined the role of avoidant and approach coping style as a moderator of VR distraction effectiveness. Sixty-two children (6-13 years old) underwent a baseline cold pressor trial followed by two cold pressor trials in which interactive videogame distraction was delivered both with and without a VR helmet in counterbalanced order. As predicted, children demonstrated significant improvement in pain tolerance during both interactive videogame distraction conditions. However, a differential response to videogame distraction with or without the enhancement of VR technology was not found. Children's coping style did not moderate their response to distraction. Rather, interactive videogame distraction with and without VR technology was equally effective for children who utilized avoidant or approach coping styles. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",doi,10.1007/s10865-012-9479-0,Scopus,Journal of Behavioral Medicine,"Sil S., Dahlquist L.M., Thompson C., Hahn A., Herbert L., Wohlheiter K., Horn S.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,The Effects Of Different Pre-Game Motivational Interventions On Athlete Free Hormonal State And Subsequent Performance In Professional Rugby Union Matches,"We examined the effect of different pre-match motivational interventions on athlete free testosterone (T) and cortisol (C) concentrations and subsequent match performance in professional rugby union. Male participants (n = 12) playing at a senior or academy level in rugby union were recruited and each completed three interventions (15. min each) before a competitive game; 1) watching a video clip of successful skill execution by the player with positive coach feedback [VPCF1]; 2) watching a video clip of successful skill execution by an opposing player with cautionary coach feedback [VCCF], 3) the player left alone to self-motivate [SM1]. The first and last interventions were retested [VPCF2 and SM2]. Salivary free T and C measures were taken pre-intervention and pre-game. Within each game, players were rated by coaching staff on a key performance indicator (KPI) from identified skills and an overall performance indicator (OPI), where 1 = best performance to 5 = worst performance. The VPCF1 and VPCF2 interventions both promoted significant T responses (11.8% to 12.5%) before each game and more so than SM1, SM2 and VCCF. The VCCF approach produced the largest C response (17.6%) and this differed from all other treatments. The VPCF interventions were also associated with better game KPI (1.5 to 1.8) and OPI ratings (1.7 to 1.8) than SM1, SM2 and/or VCCF. Across all treatments, greater individual T responses and lower C responses were associated with better KPI and OPI outcomes. In conclusion, the pre-game presentation of motivational strategies to athletes involving specific video footage and coach feedback produced different outcomes on two indicators of match performance, which were also associated with changes in free hormonal state. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",doi,10.1016/j.physbeh.2012.05.009,Scopus,Physiology and Behavior,"Cook C.J., Crewther B.T.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,The Effects Of Imagery-Manipulated Appraisal On Intensity And Direction Of Competitive Anxiety,"This study attempted to manipulate an athlete's facilitative or debilitative appraisal (direction; Jones, 1995) of competitive anxiety through imagery-based interventions in order to study the effects on subsequent anxiety intensity (heart rate and CSAI-2) and direction (CSAI-2D; Jones & Swain, 1992). In a within-subjects' design, 24 experienced soccer players were relaxed via progressive relaxation audiotape and then randomly underwent an imagery-based video-and audiotaped manipulation of their appraisal of taking a hypothetical game-winning penalty kick under either a ""pressure"" or ""challenge"" appraisal emphasis. There was no significant effect for heart rate. A repeated measures MANOVA for CSAI-2 and CSAI-2D scores revealed that for both intensity and direction scores the challenge condition produced less cognitive anxiety, less somatic anxiety, and more self-confidence (all p < .001) than the pressure situation. This finding suggests that a challenge appraisal manipulation taught by applied sport psychologists might benefit athletes' performance.",doi,10.1123/tsp.12.1.40,Scopus,Sport Psychologist,"Hale B.D., Whitehouse A.",1998,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,"The Effects Of Prosocial Video Games On Prosocial Behaviors: International Evidence From Correlational, Experimental, And Longitudinal Studies.","Although dozens of studies have documented a relationship between violent video games and aggressive behaviors, very little attention has been paid to potential effects of prosocial games. Theoretically, games in which game characters help and support each other in nonviolent ways should increase both short-term and long-term prosocial behaviors. We report three studies conducted in three countries with three age groups to test this hypothesis. In the correlational study, Singaporean middle-school students who played more prosocial games behaved more prosocially. In the two longitudinal samples of Japanese children and adolescents, prosocial game play predicted later increases in prosocial behavior.

Participants were then measured for aggressive affect (Experiment 1), aggressive cognition (Experiment 2), and aggressive behavior (Experiment 3). Rewarding violent game actions increased hostile emotion, aggressive thinking, and aggressive behavior.

,The Effects Of Scent And Game Play Experience On Memory Of A Virtual Environment,"Scent has been well documented as having significant effects on emotion (Alaoui-Ismaili in Physiol Behav 62(4):713 - 720, Herz et al. in Motiv Emot 28(4):363 - 383, learning (Smith et al. in Percept Mot Skills 74(2):339 - 343, 1992; Morgan in Percept Mot Skills 83(3)(2):1227 - 1234, 1996, memory (Herz in Am J Psychol 110(4):489 - 505, 1997) and task performance (Barker et al. in Percept Mot Skills 97(3)(1):1007 - 1010, 2003). This paper describes an experiment in which environmentally appropriate scent was presented as an additional sensory modality consistent with other aspects of a virtual environment called DarkCon. Subjects' game play habits were recorded as an additional factor for analysis. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive scent during the VE, and/or afterward during a task of recall of the environment. It was hypothesized that scent presentation during the VE would significantly improve recall, and that subjects who were presented with scent during the recall task, in addition to experiencing the scented VE, would perform the best on the recall task. Skin-conductance was a significant predictor of recall, over and above experimental groups. Finally, it was hypothesized that subjects' game play habits would affect both their behavior in and recall of the environment. Results are encouraging to the use of scent in virtual environments, and directions for future research are discussed. © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2007.",doi,10.1007/s10055-006-0056-0,Scopus,Virtual Reality,"Tortell R., Luigi D.P., Dozois A., Bouchard S., Morie J.F., Ilan D.",2007,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,"The Effects Of Technological Advancement And Violent Content In Video Games On Players' Feelings Of Presence, Involvement, Physiological Arousal, And Aggression","The possible impact of technological advancement on video games' effects - particularly in the case of violent games - has often been discussed but has not been thoroughly explored by empirical research. The present investigation employed a 2 × 2 between-subjects factorial experiment to examine the interplay of technological advancement and violence by exposing participants (N = 120) to either a newer or older version of a violent or nonviolent game and measuring these factors' effects on players' sense of presence, involvement, physiological arousal (measured by skin conductance), self-reported arousal, and affective and cognitive aggression. The results indicate that technological advancement increased participants' sense of presence, involvement, and physiological and self-reported arousal. Neither advancement nor violence had statistically significant effects on accessibility of players' aggressive thoughts, but there is some tentative evidence that violent game content increased players' state hostility.

,"The Effects Of Video Game Play On Young Children’s Aggression, Fantasy And Prosocial Behavior.","From the ecological perspective of human development the emergence of significant media may affect children's behavior. It has been suggested that the home computer has the potential to affect young children's behavior, but no published data currently exist to support this hypothesis. However, home computer games have features similar to television. In that vein, research on television and aggression lends itself as a paradigm for studying the effects of video games on young children's behavior. From past television research it may be hypothesized that exposure to violent video games will increase children's aggressive behavior. Twenty-eight children, age 4 to 6 years were observed in a free play setting at baseline, after watching a violent cartoon and after playing “Space Invaders”. Results indicated significant differences in aggressive behavior, relative to baseline behaviors, after watching television and after playing video games.

The second goal was to examine associations among violent video game exposure, hostility, arguments with teachers, school grades, and physical fights. In addition, path analyses were conducted to test mediational pathways from video game habits to outcomes. Six hundred and seven 8th- and 9th-grade students from four schools participated. Adolescents who expose themselves to greater amounts of video game violence were more hostile, reported getting into arguments with teachers more frequently, were more likely to be involved in physical fights, and performed more poorly in school.

,The Emergence Of Artificial Autonomy: A View From The Foothills Of A Challenging Climb,"In this chapter we set forth a case study of the integration of philosophy and computer science using artificial agents, beings ruled by abductive logic and emergent behavior. Our first step in this chapter is to highlight different models that we developed of such agents (a set of them related with evolutionary game theory and one model of a narrative storyteller robot). As we indicate, each model exemplifies different aspects of the bottom of the hill of autonomy as an emergent property of artificial systems specified through three aspects (""Self control"", ""Adaptivity to the environment"" and ""Response to environment""). In summary, our conception is that autonomy, when presented as an emergent characteristic, could fill the important place given it by elaborations in philosophical ethics and one that leads us to a clearer comprehension of where to direct our efforts in the field of artificial agents. We conclude this chapter with the notion that this reevaluation of autonomy is necessary for the enhanced comprehension of human morality. © 2015, IGI Global.",doi,10.4018/978-1-4666-8592-5.ch004,Scopus,Rethinking Machine Ethics in the Age of Ubiquitous Technology,"Da Costa Cardoso F., Pereira L.M.",2015,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,The Future Of Earth Observation In Hydrology,"In just the past 5 years, the field of Earth observation has progressed beyond the offerings of conventional space-agency-based platforms to include a plethora of sensing opportunities afforded by CubeSats, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and smartphone technologies that are being embraced by both for-profit companies and individual researchers. Over the previous decades, space agency efforts have brought forth well-known and immensely useful satellites such as the Landsat series and the Gravity Research and Climate Experiment (GRACE) system, with costs typically of the order of 1 billion dollars per satellite and with concept-to-launch timelines of the order of 2 decades (for new missions). More recently, the proliferation of smartphones has helped to miniaturize sensors and energy requirements, facilitating advances in the use of CubeSats that can be launched by the dozens, while providing ultra-high (3- 5 m) resolution sensing of the Earth on a daily basis. Startup companies that did not exist a decade ago now operate more satellites in orbit than any space agency, and at costs that are a mere fraction of traditional satellite missions. With these advances come new space-borne measurements, such as real-time high-definition video for tracking air pollution, storm-cell development, flood propagation, precipitation monitoring, or even for constructing digital surfaces using structure-from-motion techniques. Closer to the surface, measurements from small unmanned drones and tethered balloons have mapped snow depths, floods, and estimated evaporation at sub-metre resolutions, pushing back on spatio-temporal constraints and delivering new process insights. At ground level, precipitation has been measured using signal attenuation between antennae mounted on cell phone towers, while the proliferation of mobile devices has enabled citizen scientists to catalogue photos of environmental conditions, estimate daily average temperatures from battery state, and sense other hydrologically important variables such as channel depths using commercially available wireless devices. Global internet access is being pursued via highaltitude balloons, solar planes, and hundreds of planned satellite launches, providing a means to exploit the ""internet of things"" as an entirely new measurement domain. Such global access will enable real-time collection of data from billions of smartphones or from remote research platforms. This future will produce petabytes of data that can only be accessed via cloud storage and will require new analytical approaches to interpret. The extent to which today's hydrologic models can usefully ingest such massive data volumes is unclear. Nor is it clear whether this deluge of data will be usefully exploited, either because the measurements are superfluous, inconsistent, not accurate enough, or simply because we lack the capacity to process and analyse them. What is apparent is that the tools and techniques afforded by this array of novel and game-changing sensing platforms present our community with a unique opportunity to develop new insights that advance fundamental aspects of the hydrological sciences. To accomplish this will require more than just an application of the technology: in some cases, it will demand a radical rethink on how we utilize and exploit these new observing systems. © Author(s) 2017.",doi,10.5194/hess-21-3879-2017,Scopus,Hydrology and Earth System Sciences,"McCabe M.F., Rodell M., Alsdorf D.E., Miralles D.G., Uijlenhoet R., Wagner W., Lucieer A., Houborg R., Verhoest N.E.C., Franz T.E., Shi J., Gao H., Wood E.F.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,The Game Body: Toward A Phenomenology Of Contemporary Video Gaming,"Synthesizing research in philosophy and phenomenology, this article offers a sympathetic critique of Vivian Sobchack's view of digital moving images. Focusing on contemporary first- and third-player video games, it examines how digital imagery inscribes bodily dimensions onto a nonindexical world and the different ways in which we inhabit cinematic and electronic space. More specifically, it draws upon the writings of Maurice Merleau-Ponty to build a phenomenological model of bodies in digital imagery and argues that video gaming is a fully embodied, sensuous, carnal activity. © The Author(s) 2011.",doi,10.1177/1555412010364980,Scopus,Games and Culture,Crick T.,2011,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,The Health Benefits Of Interactive Video Game Exercise,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of interactive video games (combined with stationary cycling) on health-related physical fitness and exercise adherence in comparison with traditional aerobic training (stationary cycling alone). College-aged males were stratified (aerobic fitness and body mass) and then assigned randomly to experimental (n = 7) or control (n = 7) conditions. Program attendance, health-related physical fitness (including maximal aerobic power (VO2 max), body composition, muscular strength, muscular power, and flexibility), and resting blood pressure were measured before and after training (60%-75% heart rate reserve, 3 d/week for 30 min/d for 6 weeks). There was a significant difference in the attendance of the interactive video game and traditional training groups (78% ± 18% vs. 48% ± 29%, respectively). VO2 max was significantly increased after interactive video game (11% ± 5%) but not traditional (3% ± 6%) training. There was a significantly greater reduction in resting systolic blood pressure after interactive video game (132 ± 6 vs. 123 ± 6 mmHg) than traditional (131 ± 7 vs. 128 ± 8 mmHg) training. There were no significant changes in body composition after either training program. Attendance mediated the relationships between condition and changes in health outcomes (including VO2 max, vertical jump, and systolic blood pressure). The present investigation indicates that a training program that links interactive video games to cycle exercise results in greater improvements in health-related physical fitness than that seen after traditional cycle exercise training. It appears that greater attendance, and thus a higher volume of physical activity, is the mechanism for the differences in health-related physical fitness. © 2007 NRC.",doi,10.1139/H07-038,Scopus,"Applied Physiology, Nutrition and Metabolism","Warburton D.E.R., Bredin S.S.D., Horita L.T.L., Zbogar D., Scott J.M., Esch B.T.A., Rhodes R.E.",2007,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,The Hidden Dimensions Of The Competition Effect: Basal Cortisol And Basal Testosterone Jointly Predict Changes In Salivary Testosterone After Social Victory In Men,"Dominance struggles appear to affect hormone concentrations in many mammalian species, such that higher concentrations of testosterone are seen in winners of competitions, compared to losers. This so-called, ""competition effect"" has received inconsistent empirical support, suggesting that additional psychological (e.g., mood), situational (i.e., nature of the competition) and physiological (e.g., cortisol) variables might intervene in modulating testosterone fluctuations after social contests. We investigated possible interactions between the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) stress axis in predicting transient changes in testosterone after social victory or defeat on a familiar competitive task. In particular, the present study examined the dual-hormone hypothesis - proposing that baseline cortisol potently modulates the competition effect (Mehta and Josephs, 2010) - in a sample of healthy young men engaged in head-to-head competition on a widely played commercial videogame, Tetris. We found a significant interaction between HPG and HPA axes status and the competition effect on testosterone in the randomly assigned videogame winners, such that winners with a pre-competition combination of high baseline testosterone and low baseline cortisol exhibited significantly greater post-competition testosterone concentrations. The randomly assigned videogame losers showed significantly decreased post-competition levels of testosterone. Possible biological and evolutionary mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are discussed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.psyneuen.2012.03.022,Scopus,Psychoneuroendocrinology,"Zilioli S., Watson N.V.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,The Immersive Virtual Reality Experience: A Typology Of Users Revealed Through Multiple Correspondence Analysis Combined With Cluster Analysis Technique,"Immersive virtual reality is thought to be advantageous by leading to higher levels of presence. However, and despite users getting actively involved in immersive three-dimensional virtual environments that incorporate sound and motion, there are individual factors, such as age, video game knowledge, and the predisposition to immersion, that may be associated with the quality of virtual reality experience. Moreover, one particular concern for users engaged in immersive virtual reality environments (VREs) is the possibility of side effects, such as cybersickness. The literature suggests that at least 60% of virtual reality users report having felt symptoms of cybersickness, which reduces the quality of the virtual reality experience. The aim of this study was thus to profile the right user to be involved in a VRE through head-mounted display. To examine which user characteristics are associated with the most effective virtual reality experience (lower cybersickness), a multiple correspondence analysis combined with cluster analysis technique was performed. Results revealed three distinct profiles, showing that the PC gamer profile is more associated with higher levels of virtual reality effectiveness, that is, higher predisposition to be immersed and reduced cybersickness symptoms in the VRE than console gamer and nongamer. These findings can be a useful orientation in clinical practice and future research as they help identify which users are more predisposed to benefit from immersive VREs. © Copyright 2016, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",doi,10.1089/cyber.2015.0130,Scopus,"Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking","Rosa P.J., Morais D., Gamito P., Oliveira J., Saraiva T.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,The Influence Of Game Duration And Playing Position On Intensity Of Exercise During Match-Play In Elite Water Polo Players,"In this study, we assessed exercise intensity in 20 water polo games of different duration. The hypothesis that right wing players perform at a higher intensity than back and forward central players was also tested. Thirty water polo players, equally split between three field positions, participated in the study. Initially, their performance-related physiological capabilities were evaluated. Subsequently, during water polo games of short (4 × 7-min periods) or long duration (4 × 9-min periods), heart rate was monitored continuously and blood lactate concentration was measured at the end of each period. Activity patterns were also recorded using a video camera. Mean heart rate over the entire game was 156 ± 18 beats · min-1. Overall exercise intensity fluctuated around a value corresponding to the lactate threshold (4.03 ± 0.96 mmol · -186 ± 5% of peak heart rate) and decreased (P &lt; 0.003) with game time (4.22 ± 1.8 and 3.47 ± 1.9 mmol · l-1 in the second and fourth quarter, respectively). During the last 6 min, heart rate was higher (P &lt; 0.001) in games of short duration (156 ± 3 beats · min-1) than in games of long duration (152 ± 8 beats · min-1). Video analysis showed that the percentage of time spent in low-intensity activities (i.e. ""out of game"") was lower (23 vs. 26%), whereas that in high-intensity activities (i.e. ""sprinting crawl"") was higher (21 vs. 19%), in games of short compared with long duration. No difference was observed among players of various field positions in any of the variables examined. Thus during match-play, games of long duration produced significantly lower heart rate responses than games of short duration, and the physiological response exhibited by the players was not affected by field position. The water polo authorities should consider these results before changing game duration and coaches should prepare their athletes accordingly.",doi,10.1080/02640410500457794,Scopus,Journal of Sports Sciences,"Platanou T., Geladas N.",2006,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,The Influence Of The Playing Surface On The Exercise Intensity Of Small-Sided Recreational Soccer Games,"This study aimed to analyze the influence of the playing surface on movement pattern, physical loading, perceived exertion, and fatigue development during small-sided recreational soccer games. Time-motion, heart rate, blood lactate, and perceived exertion were measured for 16 recreational players aged 22 (range: 19-35)yrs. During 5-a-side soccer games on 3 different field surfaces: sand, artificial turf, and asphalt. Jump and sprint tests were performed prior to and after each game. Total distance covered was higher on asphalt and turf than on sand (3.89±0.04 and 3.73±0.12 vs. 2.59±0.21km; p&lt;01), and the number of high-intensity runs was higher on asphalt than on turf (55±3 vs. 43±3; p&lt;.05), but not sand (46±6). Mean heart rate (means±SEM, 160±3 vs. 171±1 b.p.m.) and time&gt;90% HRmax (20.8±5.1% vs. 44.1±5.0%) were lower (p&lt;.05) on asphalt than on turf, with intermediate values for sand. Blood lactate was lower on asphalt than on sand (2.8±0.3 vs. 4.7±0.6mmolL-1; p&lt;.05). Perceived exertion was lower on asphalt than on turf and sand (VAS 0-100: 52±3 vs. 72±3 and 72±3; p&lt;.01). After the game, squat and countermovement jump performances were lower (4.9-8.1%, and 1.9-6.4%, respectively; p&lt;.001) for all field surfaces, but no changes were observed in 5- and 30-m sprint performance. Small-sided recreational soccer games elicit high heart rates, multiple intense actions, and decreased jump performance for all the investigated playing surfaces, suggesting that multiple fitness and health benefits can be achieved through soccer on sand, artificial turf and asphalt. Nonetheless, locomotor activities, heart rate, blood lactate levels, and perceived exertion differ between surfaces. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",doi,10.1016/j.humov.2011.08.011,Scopus,Human Movement Science,"Brito J., Krustrup P., Rebelo A.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,The Loughborough Intermittent Shuttle Test: A Field Test That Simulates The Activity Pattern Of Soccer,"The aims of this study were to describe and determine the test–retest reliability of an exercise protocol, the Loughborough Intermittent Shuttle Test (the LIST), which was designed to simulate the activity pattern characteristic of the game of soccer. The protocol consisted of two parts: Part A comprised a fixed period of variable-intensity shuttle running over 20 m; Part B consisted of continuous running, alternating every 20 m between 55% and 95% (Formula Presented), until volitional fatigue. Seven trained games players (age 21.5 ± 0.9 years, height 182 ± 2 cm, body mass 80.1 ± 3.6 kg, (Formula Presented) 59.0 ± 1.9 ml·kg-1·min-1; mean ± sx) performed the test on two occasions (Trial 1 and Trial 2), at least 7 days apart, to determine the test–retest reliability of the sprint times and running capacity. The physiological and metabolic responses on both occasions were also monitored. The par ticipants ingested water ad libitum during the first trial, and were then prescribed the same amount of water during the second trial. The 15 m sprint times during Trials 1 and 2 averaged 2.42 ± 0.04 s and 2.43 ± 0.04 s, respectively. Run time during Part B was 6.3 ± 2.0 min for Trial 1 and 6.1 ± 1.3 min for Trial 2. The 95% limits of agreement for sprint times and run times during Part B were –0.14 to 0.12 s and –3.19 to 2.16 min respectively. There were no differences between trials for hear t rate, rating of perceived exertion, body mass change during exercise, or blood lactate and glucose concentrations during the test. Thus, we conclude that the sprint times and the Part B run times were reproducible within the limits previously stated. In addition, the activity pattern and the physiological and metabolic responses closely simulated the match demands of soccer. © 2000 Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd.",doi,10.1080/026404100365162,Scopus,Journal of Sports Sciences,"Nicholas C.W., Nuttall F.E., Williams C.",2e3,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,The Motivating Role Of Violence In Video Games,"Six studies, two survey based and four experimental, explored the relations between violent content and people's motivation and enjoyment of video game play. Based on self-determination theory, the authors hypothesized that violence adds little to enjoyment or motivation for typical players once autonomy and competence need satisfactions are considered. As predicted, results from all studies showed that enjoyment, value, and desire for future play were robustly associated with the experience of autonomy and competence in gameplay. Violent content added little unique variance in accounting for these outcomes and was also largely unrelated to need satisfactions. The studies also showed that players high in trait aggression were more likely to prefer or value games with violent contents, even though violent contents did not reliably enhance their game enjoyment or immersion. Discussion focuses on the significance of the current findings for individuals and the understanding of motivation in virtual environments. © 2009 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.",doi,10.1177/0146167208327216,Scopus,Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin,"Przybylski A.K., Ryan R.M., Rigby C.S.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,The Motivational Pull Of Video Games: A Self-Determination Theory Approach,"Four studies apply self-determination theory (SDT; Ryan & Deci, 2000) in investigating motivation for computer game play, and the effects of game play on well-being. Studies 1-3 examine individuals playing 1, 2 and 4 games, respectively and show that perceived in-game autonomy and competence are associated with game enjoyment, preferences, and changes in well-being pre- to post-play. Competence and autonomy perceptions are also related to the intuitive nature of game controls, and the sense of presence or immersion in participants' game play experiences. Study 4 surveys an on-line community with experience in multi-player games. Results show that SDT's theorized needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness independently predict enjoyment and future game play. The SDT model is also compared with Yee's (2005) motivation taxonomy of game play motivations. Results are discussed in terms of the relatively unexplored landscape of human motivation within virtual worlds. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",doi,10.1007/s11031-006-9051-8,Scopus,Motivation and Emotion,"Ryan R.M., Rigby C.S., Przybylski A.",2006,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,The Neural Bases Of Cooperation And Competition: An Fmri Investigation,"Cooperation and competition are two basic modes of social cognition that necessitate monitoring of both one's own and others' actions, as well as adopting a specific mental set. In this fMRI, study individuals played a specially designed computer game, according to a set of predefined rules, either in cooperation with or in competition against another person. The hemodynamic response during these conditions was contrasted to that of the same subjects playing the game independently. Both cooperation and competition stances resulted in activation of a common frontoparietal network subserving executive functions, as well as the anterior insula, involved in autonomic arousal. Moreover, distinct regions were found to be selectively associated with cooperation and competition, notably the orbitofrontal cortex in the former and the inferior parietal and medial prefrontal cortices in the latter. This pattern reflects the different mental frameworks implicated in being cooperative versus competitive with another person. In accordance with evidence from evolutionary psychology as well as from developmental psychology, we argue that cooperation is a socially rewarding process and is associated with specific left medial orbitofrontal cortex involvement. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

,The Neural Mechanisms Of Affect Infusion In Social Economic Decision-Making: A Mediating Role Of The Anterior Insula,"Though emotions have been shown to have sometimes dramatic effects on decision-making, the neural mechanisms mediating these biases are relatively unexplored. Here, we investigated how incidental affect (i.e. emotional states unrelated to the decision at hand) may influence decisions, and how these biases are implemented in the brain. Nineteen adult participants made decisions which involved accepting or rejecting monetary offers from others in an Ultimatum Game while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Prior to each set of decisions, participants watched a short video clip aimed at inducing either a sad or neutral emotional state. Results demonstrated that, as expected, sad participants rejected more unfair offers than those in the neutral condition. Neuroimaging analyses revealed that receiving unfair offers while in a sad mood elicited activity in brain areas related to aversive emotional states and somatosensory integration (anterior insula) and to cognitive conflict (anterior cingulate cortex). Sad participants also showed a diminished sensitivity in neural regions associated with reward processing (ventral striatum). Importantly, insular activation uniquely mediated the relationship between sadness and decision bias. This study is the first to reveal how subtle mood states can be integrated at the neural level to influence decision-making. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",doi,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.02.027,Scopus,NeuroImage,"Harlé K.M., Chang L.J., van 't Wout M., Sanfey A.G.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,The Power Of Words At Mega-Event Opening Ceremonies,"This article analyzes the opening speech of John Furlong, CEO of the Vancouver Organizing Committee for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games, at the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympic Games. The main idea here is the great importance of a speech at the opening ceremony of a mega-event. The characteristics of the speech were analyzed through the speaker's choice of words (figures of speech and rhetorical devices). The role of the speech was analyzed to show how the main event concept is promoted. The research is divided into two parts. The first presents a review of the literature and of other relevant resources such as video material and web pages as a basis for preparing the theoretical part of the article. In the second, more empirically oriented part of the article, we conducted a linguistic analysis involving an indepth discourse analyses of John Furlong's speech and the analyses of syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. Through the review of the literature and of other resources, we have established the importance of an additional Olympic theme along with the main sport-related theme. The empirical research that is based on the discourse analyses shows that, despite its brevity, John Furlong's speech stresses the theme and the values of the mega-event, and it is also highly communicative, incorporating the various significant semantics and pragmatics of a good speech: Brevity, simple words and sentences, colloquial language, relating to the audiences, employing stylistic and grammatical devices, appealing to the audience's feelings and emotions, and the delivery with appropriate rhythm, emphasis, and pauses. When conducting the research, we were unable to identify any other studies that have undertaken a detailed analysis of this speech. There are numerous analyses of how the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympic Games were prepared and also staged. We have also found some that focused on the theme of the event, but none focused on how the message of the event was delivered to the general public and the residents of host communities. This strengthens the originality and importance of our research. © 2016 Cognizant, LLC.",doi,10.3727/109830416X14750895902710,Scopus,"Tourism, Culture and Communication","Gorenak M., Topler J.P.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,The Relationship Between Specific Cognitive Impairment And Behaviour In Prader-Willi Syndrome,"Background Individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) have been shown to demonstrate a particular cognitive deficit in attention switching and high levels of preference for routine and temper outbursts. This study assesses whether a specific pathway between a cognitive deficit and behaviour via environmental interaction can exist in individuals with PWS.Methods Four individuals with PWS participated in a series of three single-case experiments including laboratory-based and natural environment designs. Cognitive (computer-based) challenges placed varying demands on attention switching or controlled for the cognitive demands of the tasks while placing no demands on switching. Unexpected changes to routines or expectations were presented in controlled games, or imposed on participants' natural environments and compared with control conditions during which no unexpected changes occurred. Behaviour was observed and heart rate was measured.Results Participants showed significantly increased temper outburst related behaviours during cognitive challenges that placed demands on attention switching, relative to the control cognitive challenges. Participants showed significantly increased temper outburst related behaviours when unexpected changes occurred in an experimental or the natural environment compared with when no changes occurred.Conclusions Difficult behaviours that could be triggered reliably in an individual by a specific cognitive demand could also be triggered via manipulation of the environment. Results suggest that a directional relationship between a specific cognitive deficit and behaviour, via environmental interaction, can exist in individuals with PWS. © 2011 The Authors.

,The Role Of Daily Activities In Youths' Stress Physiology,"Purpose: This study examined links between diurnal patterns of the stress hormone cortisol and time spent by adolescents in nine common daily activities. Methods: During eight consecutive nightly telephone interviews, 28 youths (n = 12 girls), 10-18 years of age, reported their daily activities. On 4 days, four saliva samples were also collected and assayed for cortisol. Multilevel models assessed within- and between-person associations between time in each activity and cortisol area under the curve (AUC), cortisol awakening response (CAR), morning peak (30 minutes after wake up), and daily decline (morning peak to bedtime). Results: Links with AUC were found for most activities; significant associations with cortisol rhythms suggested that most effects were due to anticipation of the day's activities. Specifically, on days when youths spent more time than usual on video games and television, they had lower AUCs, with lower morning peaks. Youths who spent more time reading (within-person) and in computer-related activities (between-person) had higher AUCs, with stronger CARs (within-person). Youths who slept more had lower AUCs, with lower morning peaks on both the between- and within-person levels. Amounts of time spent in clubs, and for older adolescents in sports, were also linked to lower AUCs. Finally, youths who spent more time in school/schoolwork had lower average AUCs, but on days when youths spent more time than usual in school, they had higher AUCs, stronger CARs, and steeper daily declines. Conclusion: Beyond their known implications for psychological adjustment, youths' everyday activities are linked to stress physiology. © 2012 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.",doi,10.1016/j.jadohealth.2012.03.016,Scopus,Journal of Adolescent Health,"McHale S.M., Blocklin M.K., Walter K.N., Davis K.D., Almeida D.M., Klein L.C.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,The Role Of Human-Automation Consensus In Multiple Unmanned Vehicle Scheduling,"Objective: This study examined the impact of increasing automation replanning rates on operator performance and workload when supervising a decentralized network of heterogeneous unmanned vehicles. Background: Futuristic unmanned vehicles systems will invert the operator-to-vehicle ratio so that one operator can control multiple dissimilar vehicles connected through a decentralized network. Significant human-automation collaboration will be needed because of automation brittleness, but such collaboration could cause high workload. Method: Three increasing levels of replanning were tested on an existing multiple unmanned vehicle simulation environment that leverages decentralized algorithms for vehicle routing and task allocation in conjunction with human supervision. Results: Rapid replanning can cause high operator workload, ultimately resulting in poorer overall system performance. Poor performance was associated with a lack of operator consensus for when to accept the automations suggested prompts for new plan consideration as well as negative attitudes toward unmanned aerial vehicles in general. Participants with video game experience tended to collaborate more with the automation, which resulted in better performance. Conclusion: In decentralized unmanned vehicle networks, operators who ignore the automations requests for new plan consideration and impose rapid replans both increase their own workload and reduce the ability of the vehicle network to operate at its maximum capacity. Application: These findings have implications for personnel selection and training for futuristic systems involving human collaboration with decentralized algorithms embedded in networks of autonomous systems. © 2010, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.",doi,10.1177/0018720810368674,Scopus,Human Factors,"Cummings M.L., Clare A., Hart C.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas

,Thermal Treatment Of The Minority Game,"We study a cost function for the aggregate behavior of all the agents involved in the minority game (MG) or the bar attendance model (BAM). The cost function allows us to define a deterministic, synchronous dynamic that yields results that have the main relevant features than those of the probabilistic, sequential dynamics used for the MG or the BAM. We define a temperature through a Langevin approach in terms of the fluctuations of the average attendance. We prove that the cost function is an extensive quantity that can play the role of an internal energy of the many-agent system while the temperature so defined is an intensive parameter. We compare the results of the thermal perturbation to the deterministic dynamics and prove that they agree with those obtained with the MG or BAM in the limit of very low temperature. © 2002 The American Physical Society.",doi,10.1103/PhysRevE.65.036711,Scopus,"Physical Review E - Statistical Physics, Plasmas, Fluids, and Related Interdisciplinary Topics","Burgos E., Ceva H., Perazzo R.P.J.",2002,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas

In order to develop touch-less, interactive and augmented reality games on vision-based wearable device, a touch-less motion interaction technology is designed and evaluated in this work. Users interact with the augmented reality games with dynamic hands/feet gestures in front of the camera, which triggers the interaction event to interact with the virtual object in the scene. Three primitive augmented reality games with eleven dynamic gestures are developed based on the proposed touch-less interaction technology as proof.

Theoretically driven explanations are provided that describe the relative effectiveness and ineffectiveness of different ABLE features to foster adaptive emotions (e.g., engagement, curiosity) vs. non-adaptive emotions (e.g., frustration, boredom) in six different environments. This review provides an analytical lens to evaluate and improve upon research with ABLEs by identifying specific system features and their relationship with learners' appraisals and emotions.

,Traditional Games Resulted In Post-Exercise Hypotension And A Lower Cardiovascular Response To The Cold Pressor Test In Healthy Children,"The present study aimed to verify if blood pressure (BP) reactivity could be reduced through a previous single session of active playing when compared to sedentary leisure. Sixteen pre-pubertal healthy children participated in this study. After familiarization with procedures and anthropometric evaluation, participants performed three sessions in randomized order: (1) 30 min of traditional Brazilian games (PLAY); (2) 30 min of video game playing (DDR); and (3) 30 min of watching TV (TV). Each session lasted 80 min, being 10 min of rest; 30 min of intervention activity; and 40 min of recovery. After recovery, the Cold Pressor Test (CPT) was used for the assessment of acute cardiovascular reactivity. BP was recorded at 30 s and 1 min during the CPT. Analysis of variance showed post-exercise hypotension (PEH) only after PLAY, and that systolic and diastolic BP were significantly increased in all conditions during CPT. However, the magnitude of the CPT-induced BP response was significantly less in PLAY compared to DDR and TV. The PEH observed during recovery and the reduced BP response to CPT following playing traditional games may be due its higher cardiovascular and metabolic demand as was indicated by the increased heart rate, oxygen consumption, and BP. It was concluded that BP reactivity to stress may be reduced through a previous single session of traditional games and that PEH was recorded only after this exercise form. This benefit indicates a potential role of playing strategies for cardiovascular health in childhood. © 2014 Rauber, Boullosa, Carvalho, de Moraes, de Sousa, Simões and Campbell.",doi,10.3389/fphys.2014.00235,Scopus,Frontiers in Physiology,"Rauber S.B., Boullosa A.

,Trait And State Emotion Congruence In Simulated Casinos: Effects On At-Risk Gambling Intention And Restoration,"This research examined the effects of casino design and congruence in trait and state emotion on at-risk gambling intentions and psychological restoration. Video simulations representing two casino designs (playground vs. gaming) were presented to 484 participants (241 males) varying in gambling sub-type. The playground design features a recognizable theme, elements of nature, and spaciousness; the gaming design focuses on the gambling machines in a maze-like setting with low ceilings. For low trait arousal participants, at-risk intentions were higher when environmental arousal (EA) was high (mismatch) than when low (match). For high trait arousal participants, at-risk intentions were higher when EA was high (match) than when low (mismatch). A similar pattern of results occurred for restoration but only for pleasure trait-state congruency in non-problem gamblers. For problem gamblers, the effects of trait-state congruence on restoration were restricted to those with low trait pleasure for the playground design. The effects of congruence in trait and state emotion are bounded by the positivity of the outcome (at-risk gambling intention vs. restoration), the design of the casino (playground vs. gaming), the dimension of emotion (arousal vs. pleasure), the pole of the emotion (low vs. high), and gambler subtype (problem vs. non-problem).

,"Types, Locations, And Scales From Cluttered Natural Video And Actions","We model the autonomous development of brain-inspired circuits through two modalities - video stream and action stream that are synchronized in time. We assume that such multimodal streams are available to a baby through inborn reflexes, self-supervision, and caretaker's supervision, when the baby interacts with the real world. By autonomous development, we mean that not only that the internal (inside the 'skull') self-organization is fully autonomous, but the developmental program (DP) that regulates the computation of the network is also task nonspecific. In this work, the task-nonspecificity is reflected by the fact that the actions associated with an attended object in a cluttered, natural, and dynamic scene is taught after the DP is finished and the 'life' has begun. The actions correspond to neuronal firing patterns representing object type, object location and object scale, but learning is directly from unsegmented cluttered scenes. Along the line of where-what networks (WWN), this is the first one that explicitly models multiple 'brain' areas - each for a different range of object scales. Among experiments, large natural video experiments were conducted. To show the power of automatic attention in unknown cluttered backgrounds, the last experimental group demonstrated disjoint tests in the presence of large within-class variations (object 3-D-rotations in very different unknown backgrounds), but small between-class variations (small object patches in large similar and different unknown backgrounds), in contrast with global classification tests such as ImageNet and Atari Games. © 2015 IEEE.",doi,10.1109/TAMD.2015.2478377,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Autonomous Mental Development,"Song X., Zhang W., Weng J.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Use Of A Distracting Task To Obtain Defensive Head Movements To Looming Visual Stimuli By Human Adults In A Laboratory Setting.,"Defensive responses to looming visual stimuli have been obtained in a wide variety of species, including human infants as young as one week. This phenomenon has not, however, been formally demonstrated for adults under laboratory conditions. In this paper it is reported that similar responses, namely avoidance movements of the head, can be obtained in most human adults provided that they are suitably distracted by playing a computer tracking game. Such behaviours were not obtained when subjects were not so distracted. The use of control conditions also ruled out the possibility that simple movement cues from stimuli presented on a noncollision trajectory are sufficient stimulus to obtain defensive responses. It is of interest to note that latencies for avoidance movements were significantly shorter than those for orienting movements in the same situation, but were no different from the latencies for orienting movements when subjects were not distracted. It is argued that these findings are consistent with the proposition that defensive head movements to looming stimuli, like orienting movements to novel peripheral stimuli, represent a basic visual competence that is normally suppressed (or subsumed) by higher competences. The decision to avoid is probably based on the computation of time to contact, and may reflect the operation of a subcortical system for elementary analysis of optic flow.",doi,10.1068/p210245,Scopus,Perception,"King S.M., Dykeman C., Redgrave P., Dean P.",1992,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,"Use Of Computer-Assisted Technologies (Cat) To Enhance Social, Communicative, And Language Development In Children With Autism Spectrum Disorders","Major advances in multimedia computer technology over the past decades have made sophisticated computer games readily available to the public. This, combined with the observation that most children, including those with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), show an affinity to computers, has led researchers to recognize the potential of computer technology as an effective and efficient tool in research and treatment. This paper reviews the use of computer-assisted technology (CAT), excluding strictly internet-based approaches, to enhance social, communicative, and language development in individuals with ASD by dividing the vast literature into four main areas: language, emotion recognition, theory of mind, and social skills. Although many studies illustrate the tremendous promise of CAT to enhance skills of individuals with ASD, most lack rigorous, scientific assessment of efficacy relative to non-CAT approaches. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",doi,10.1007/s10803-012-1571-3,Scopus,Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders,"Ploog B.O., Scharf A., Nelson D., Brooks P.J.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Using A Brain-Computer Interface (Bci) In Reducing Math Anxiety: Evidence From South Africa,"Prior studies have indicated that learning mathematics is highly associated with attitudes towards mathematics and emotions like math anxiety. Over the years, strong empirical evidence has emerged, showing that math anxiety has a significant negative effect on mathematics performance. Interestingly enough, some researchers have shown that math anxiety can be trained and reduced. However, the proposed interventions have mostly focused on teachers as oppose to students, while the existing physiological approaches like cognitive behavioural therapy require administration by trained professionals. With recent advancements in technology, low cost commercial brain-computer interface (BCI) devices that can capture human emotions in real time have been developed and can have a potential use in training and reducing math anxiety. In this study, the objective was to determine if using a BCI mathematics educational game can help students to effectively reduce math anxiety. To attain this objective, a within-subjects longitudinal research design with eight data gathering waves was adopted as the primary methodology to ascertain changes in the participant's level of math anxiety across two sessions that took place on separate days. Analysis of data captured across two training sessions with a BCI mathematics educational game showed that math anxiety can be effectively trained and reduced with a BCI. In addition, the results showed that math anxiety has a significant negative impact on mathematics performance which is congruent with prior studies. These findings provide a novel way in which a low cost non-invasive BCI device can be used for educational purposes. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.compedu.2014.10.002,Scopus,Computers and Education,"Verkijika S.F., De Wet L.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Using A Computer Game To Develop Advanced Al,"In computer games, designers can use artificial intelligence to control individual characters, provide strategic direction to character groups, dynamically change parameters to make the game appropriately challenging, or produce play-by-play commentary. Computer games offer an inexpensive, reliable, and surprisingly accessible environment for conducting research in human-level AI design, often - as in the case of Quake II - with built-in AI interfaces. The author's work with the game's Quakebot demonstrated that researchers can successfully pursue serious study of autonomous AI agents within the context of computer games. This research directly applies to computer-generated forces, which require modeling realistic, entity-level behavior. Studying the impact of changes in reaction time, tactics level, and perceptual and motor skills on overall Quake II game performance helped to model these behaviors. From its scoring method, which rewards the highest number of kills, it's obvious that Quake II epitomizes violent computer games. The author does not, however, believe that the future of AI in games lies in creating ever more realistic arenas for violence. Thus, he is pursuing further research within the context of creating computer games that emphasize the drama that arises from social interactions between humans and computer characters.",doi,10.1109/2.933506,Scopus,Computer,Laird J.E.,2001,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Using Biofeedback While Immersed In A Stressful Videogame Increases The Effectiveness Of Stress Management Skills In Soldiers,"This study assessed the efficacy of using visual and auditory biofeedback while immersed in a tridimensional videogame to practice a stress management skill (tactical breathing). All 41 participants were soldiers who had previously received basic stress management training and first aid training in combat. On the first day, they received a 15-minute refresher briefing and were randomly assigned to either: (a) no additional stress management training (SMT) for three days, or (b) 30-minute sessions (one per day for three days) of biofeedback-assisted SMT while immersed in a horror/first-person shooter game. The training was performed in a dark and enclosed environment using a 50-inch television with active stereoscopic display and loudspeakers. On the last day, all participants underwent a live simulated ambush with an improvised explosive device, where they had to provide first aid to a wounded soldier. Stress levels were measured with salivary cortisol collected when waking-up, before and after the live simulation. Stress was also measured with heart rate at baseline, during an apprehension phase, and during the live simulation. Repeated-measure ANOVAs and ANCOVAs confirmed that practicing SMT was effective in reducing stress. Results are discussed in terms of the advantages of the proposed program for military personnel and the need to practice SMT. © 2012 Bouchard et al.",doi,10.1371/journal.pone.0036169,Scopus,PLoS ONE,"Bouchard S., Bernier F., Boivin E., Morin B., Robillard G.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Using Multimodal Displays To Signify Critical Handovers Of Control To Distracted Autonomous Car Drivers,"Until full autonomy is achieved in cars, drivers will still be expected to take over control of driving, and critical warnings will be essential. This paper presents a comparison of abstract versus language-based multimodal warnings signifying handovers of control in autonomous cars. While using an autonomous car simulator, participants were distracted from the road by playing a game on a tablet. An automation failure together with a car in front braking was then simulated; a rare but very critical situation for a non-attentive driver to be in. Multimodal abstract or language-based warnings signifying this situation were then delivered, either from the simulator or from the tablet, in order to discover the most effective location. Results showed that abstract cues, including audio, and cues delivered from the tablet improved handovers. This indicates the potential of moving simple but salient autonomous car warnings to where a gaming side task takes place.

,Validation And Calibration Of Physical Activity Monitors In Children,"Objective: This study was designed to validate accelerometer-based activity monitors against energy expenditure (EE) in children; to compare monitor placement sites; to field-test the monitors; and to establish sedentary, light, moderate, and vigorous threshold counts. Research Methods and Procedures: Computer Science and Applications Actigraph (CSA) and Mini-Mitter Actiwatch (MM) monitors, on the hip or lower leg, were validated and calibrated against 6-hour EE measurements by room respiration calorimetry, activity by microwave detector, and heart rate by telemetry in 26 children, 6 to 16 years old. During the 6 hours, the children performed structured activities, including resting metabolic rate (RMR), Nintendo, arts and crafts, aerobic warm-up, Tae Bo, treadmill walking and running, and games. Activity energy expenditure (AEE) computed as EE - RMR was regressed against counts to derive threshold counts. Results: The mean correlations between EE or AEE and counts were slightly higher for MM-hip (r = 0.78 ± 0.06) and MM-leg (r = 0.80 ± 0.05) than CSA-hip (r = 0.66 ± 0.08) and CSA-leg (r = 0.73 ± 0.07). CSA and MM performed similarly on the hip (inter-instrument r = 0.88) and on the lower leg (inter-instrument r = 0.89). Threshold counts for the CSA-hip were <800, <3200, <8200, and ≥8200 for sedentary, light, moderate, and vigorous categories, respectively. For the MM-hip, the threshold counts were <100, <900, <2200, and ≥2200, respectively. Discussion: The validation of the CSA and MM monitors against AEE and their calibration for sedentary, light, moderate, and vigorous thresholds certify these monitors as valid, useful devices for the assessment of physical activity in children.",doi,10.1038/oby.2002.24,Scopus,Obesity Research,"Puyau M.R., Adolph A.L., Vohra F.A., Butte N.F.",2002,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Validation Of The Angular Measurements Of A New Inertial-Measurement-Unit Based Rehabilitation System: Comparison With State-Of-The-Art Gait Analysis,"Background: Several rehabilitation systems based on inertial measurement units (IMU) are entering the market for the control of exercises and to measure performance progression, particularly for recovery after lower limb orthopaedic treatments. IMU are easy to wear also by the patient alone, but the extent to which IMU's malpositioning in routine use can affect the accuracy of the measurements is not known. A new such system (Riablo™, CoRehab, Trento, Italy), using audio-visual biofeedback based on videogames, was assessed against state-of-the-art gait analysis as the gold standard.Methods. The sensitivity of the system to errors in the IMU's position and orientation was measured in 5 healthy subjects performing two hip joint motion exercises. Root mean square deviation was used to assess differences in the system's kinematic output between the erroneous and correct IMU position and orientation.In order to estimate the system's accuracy, thorax and knee joint motion of 17 healthy subjects were tracked during the execution of standard rehabilitation tasks and compared with the corresponding measurements obtained with an established gait protocol using stereophotogrammetry.Results: A maximum mean error of 3.1 ± 1.8 deg and 1.9 ± 0.8 deg from the angle trajectory with correct IMU position was recorded respectively in the medio-lateral malposition and frontal-plane misalignment tests. Across the standard rehabilitation tasks, the mean distance between the IMU and gait analysis systems was on average smaller than 5°.Conclusions: These findings showed that the tested IMU based system has the necessary accuracy to be safely utilized in rehabilitation programs after orthopaedic treatments of the lower limb. © 2014 Leardini et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",doi,10.1186/1743-0003-11-136,Scopus,Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation,"Leardini A., Lullini G., Giannini S., Berti L., Ortolani M., Caravaggi P.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas

We propose an agent/action-oriented framework. Activity properties such as action simultaneity and motion blending, spatial coherence, motion-flow update schemes, agent attachments, and location corrections, are the main topics handled by our generic animation framework.

,Video Game Playing And Its Relations With Aggressive And Prosocial Behavior.,"In this study of 278 children from the seventh and eighth grade of five elementary schools in Enschede, The Netherlands, the relationship between the amount of time children spent on playing video games and aggressive as well as prosocial behaviour was investigated. In addition, the relationship between the preference for aggressive video games and aggressive and prosocial behaviour was studied. No significant relationship was found between video game use in general and aggressive behaviour, but a significant negative relationship with prosocial behaviour was supported. However, separate analyses for boys and girls did not reveal this relationship. More consistent results were found for the preference for aggressive video games: children, especially boys, who preferred aggressive video games were more aggressive and showed less prosocial behaviour than those with a low preference for these games. Further analyses showed that children who preferred playing aggressive video games tended to be less intelligent.",doi,10.1111/j.2044-8309.1998.tb01177.x,anderson2010,British Journal of Social Psychology,"Wiegman, O., van Schie, E.

,"Video Game Playing Increases Food Intake In Adolescents: A Randomized Crossover Study. The American Journal Of Clinical Nutrition, 93, 1196–1203.","BACKGROUND: Video game playing has been linked to obesity in many observational studies. However, the influence of this sedentary activity on food intake is unknown. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine the acute effects of sedentary video game play on various components of energy balance. DESIGN: With the use of a randomized crossover design, 22 healthy, normal-weight, male adolescents (mean ± SD age: 16.7 ± 1.1 y) completed two 1-h experimental conditions, namely video game play and rest in a sitting position, followed by an ad libitum lunch. The endpoints were spontaneous food intake, energy expenditure, stress markers, appetite sensations, and profiles of appetite-related hormones. RESULTS: Heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, sympathetic tone, and mental workload were significantly higher during the video game play condition than during the resting condition (P < 0.05). Although energy expenditure was significantly higher during video game play than during rest (mean increase over resting: 89 kJ; P < 0.01), ad libitum energy intake after video game play exceeded that measured after rest by 335 kJ (P < 0.05). A daily energy surplus of 682 kJ (163 kcal) over resting (P < 0.01) was observed in the video game play condition. The increase in food intake associated with video game play was observed without increased sensations of hunger and was not compensated for during the rest of the day. Finally, the profiles of glucose, insulin, cortisol, and ghrelin did not suggest an up-regulation of appetite during the video game play condition. CONCLUSION: A single session of video game play in healthy male adolescents is associated with an increased food intake, regardless of appetite sensations.

,"Violent Video Game Effects On Salivary Cortisol, Arousal, And Aggressive Thoughts In Children","An experiment investigated the effects of violent content in video games on two physiological indicators of the fight-or-flight response (cortisol and cardiovascular changes) and on accessibility of aggressive thoughts in children. Participants played a randomly assigned violent or nonviolent video game, rated the game on several dimensions, and did a word completion task. Results showed that the violent video game increased cortisol and (for boys) cardiovascular arousal (relative to baseline) more than did the equally exciting nonviolent game. The violent game also increased the accessibility of aggressive thoughts. The cortisol findings in particular suggest that playing a violent video game may activate the sympathetic nervous system and elicit a fight-or-flight type response in children.

,Violent Video Games And Aggression: Causal Relationship Or Byproduct Of Family Violence And Intrinsic Violence Motivation?,"Two studies examined the relationship between exposure to violent video games and aggression or violence in the laboratory and in real life. Study 1 participants were either randomized or allowed to choose to play a violent or nonviolent game. Although males were more aggressive than females, neither randomized exposure to violent-video-game conditions nor previous real-life exposure to violent video games caused any differences in aggression. Study 2 examined correlations between trait aggression, violent criminal acts, and exposure to both violent games and family violence. Results indicated that trait aggression, family violence, and male gender were predictive of violent crime, but exposure to violent games was not. Structural equation modeling suggested that family violence and innate aggression as predictors of violent crime were a better fit to the data than was exposure to video game violence. These results question the common belief that violent-video-game exposure causes violent acts.",doi,10.1177/0093854807311719,anderson2010,Criminal Justice and Behavior,"Ferguson, C. J., Rueda, S.

,Violent Video Games Stress People Out And Make Them More Aggressive,"It is well known that violent video games increase aggression, and that stress increases aggression. Many violent video games can be stressful because enemies are trying to kill players. The present study investigates whether violent games increase aggression by inducing stress in players. Stress was measured using cardiac coherence, defined as the synchronization of the rhythm of breathing to the rhythm of the heart. We predicted that cardiac coherence would mediate the link between exposure to violent video games and subsequent aggression. Specifically, we predicted that playing a violent video game would decrease cardiac coherence, and that cardiac coherence, in turn, would correlate negatively with aggression. Participants (N = 77) played a violent or nonviolent video game for 20 min. Cardiac coherence was measured before and during game play. After game play, participants had the opportunity to blast a confederate with loud noise through headphones during a reaction time task. The intensity and duration of noise blasts given to the confederate was used to measure aggression. As expected, violent video game players had lower cardiac coherence levels and higher aggression levels than did nonviolent game players. Cardiac coherence, in turn, was negatively related to aggression. This research offers another possible reason why violent games can increase aggression-by inducing stress. Cardiac coherence can be a useful tool to measure stress induced by violent video games. Cardiac coherence has several desirable methodological features as well: it is noninvasive, stable against environmental disturbances, relatively inexpensive, not subject to demand characteristics, and easy to use. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",doi,10.1002/ab.21454,Scopus,Aggressive Behavior,"Hasan Y., Bègue L., Bushman B.J.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Virtual-Reality Distraction And Cold-Pressor Pain Tolerance: Does Avatar Point Of View Matter?,"This study tested the effects of distraction using virtual-reality (VR) technology on acute pain tolerance in young adults. Forty-one undergraduate students, aged 18-23 years, used a VR head-mounted display helmet, steering wheel, and foot pedal to play an auto racing video game while undergoing exposure to very cold water (cold pressor set at 1°C). Two different game views were tested that were hypothesized to affect the degree to which participants felt ""present"" in the virtual environment: a first-person view, in which the participant saw the virtual environment through the eyes of the game character being manipulated; and a third-person view, in which the participant viewed the game character from a distance. The length of time participants tolerated the cold-water exposure (pain tolerance) under each distraction condition was compared to a baseline (no distraction) trial. Subjects also rated the degree to which they felt ""present"" in the virtual environment after each distraction trial. Results demonstrated that participants had significantly higher pain tolerance during both VR-distraction conditions relative to baseline (no distraction) trials. Although participants reported a greater sense of presence during the first-person condition than the third-person condition, pain-tolerance scores associated with the two distraction conditions did not differ. The types of VR applications in which presence may be more or less important are discussed. © Copyright 2010, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",doi,10.1089/cyber.2009.0263,Scopus,"Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking","Dahlquist L.M., Herbert L.J., Weiss K.E., Jimeno M.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Virtual Learning Environments For Culture And Intercultural Competence,"The authors review six virtual learning environments built to support the acquisition of cultural knowledge and communication skills: ATL, BiLAT, Croquelandia, Second China, TLCTS, and VECTOR. Each leverages modern 3D video game engine technology which allows high-fidelity simulation of new cultural settings, including representations of buildings, streets, art work, dress, voice, gestures, and more. To bring more realism to simulated cultural interactions, several of the systems are driven by artificial intelligence (AI) models of culture, communication, and emotion. Additionally, several rely on narrative-based techniques to place the target culture in context and enhance motivation of those using the systems.

,Vision-Based Robotic Motion Control For Non-Autonomous Environment,"A visual servo control system with SOPC structure is implemented on a retrofitted Mitsubishi Movemaster RV-M2 robotic system. The hardware circuit has the functions of quadrature encoder decoding, limit switch detecting, pulse width modulation (PWM) generating and CMOS image signal capturing. The software embedded in Nios II micro processor has the functions of using UART to communicate with PC, robotic inverse kinematics calculation, robotic motion control schemes, digital image processing and gobang game AI algorithms. The digital hardware circuits are designed by using Verilog language, and programs in Nios II micro processor are coded with C language. An Altera Statrix II EP2S60F672C5Es FPGA chip is adopted as the main CPU of the development board. A CMOS color image sensor with 356 ×292 pixels resolution is selected to catch the environment time-varying change for robotic vision-based servo control. The system performance is evaluated by experimental tests. A gobang game is planned to reveal the visual servo robotic motion control objective in non-autonomous environment. Here, a model-free intelligent self-organizing fuzzy control strategy is employed to design the robotic joint controller. A vision based trajectory planning algorithm is designed to calculate the desired angular positions or trajectory on-line of each robotic joint. The experimental results show that this visual servo control robot has reliable control actions. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",doi,10.1007/s10846-008-9286-6,Scopus,Journal of Intelligent and Robotic Systems: Theory and Applications,"Huang S.-J., Wu S.-S.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Watch Out! How A Fearful Face Adds Credibility To Warnings Of Danger,"People display facial expressions of fear to communicate danger to others and sometimes to exaggerate danger to manipulate an audience. Here we test whether fear expressions add credibility to a speaker's warnings of danger. Participants played an incentivized lie detection game in which they guess whether a confederate partner is lying or telling the truth. Participants viewed a video of their partner's message, after reading that there was a good chance (75%) their partner was instructed to lie. We manipulated across conditions whether the partner stated the message with a neutral or fearful expression. Experiment 1 finds that participants were more likely to believe the speaker's warning of danger when it was conveyed with a fear expression compared to a neutral expression. Experiment 2 finds that when a speaker instead claimed that a danger was absent, a fearful expression no longer added credibility to their message. These findings provide evidence that fear expressions add credibility to statements of danger, specifically, rather than any claim. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",doi,10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2017.03.003,Scopus,Evolution and Human Behavior,"Reed L.I., DeScioli P.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Waves Of Regret: A Meg Study Of Emotion And Decision-Making,"Recent fMRI studies have investigated brain activity involved in the feeling of regret and disappointment by manipulating the feedback participants saw after making a decision to play certain gambles: full-feedback (regret: participant sees the outcomes from both the chosen and unchosen gamble) vs. partial-feedback (disappointment: participant only sees the outcome from chosen gamble). However, regret and disappointment are also characterized by differential agency attribution: personal agency for regret, external agency for disappointment. In this study, we investigate the neural correlates of these two characterizations of regret and disappointment using magnetoencephalography (MEG). To do this, we experimentally induced each emotion by manipulating feedback (chosen gamble vs. unchosen gamble), agency (human vs. computer choice) and outcomes (win vs. loss) in a fully randomized design. At the behavioral level the emotional experience of regret and disappointment were indeed affected by both feedback and agency manipulations. These emotions also differentially affect subsequent choices, with regret leading to riskier behavior. At the neural level both feedback and agency affected the brain responses associated with regret and disappointment, demonstrating differential localization in the brain for each. Notably, feedback regret showed greater brain activity in the right anterior and posterior regions, with agency regret producing greater activity in the left anterior region. These findings extend the evidence for neural activity in processing both regret and disappointment by highlighting for the first time the respective importance of feedback and agency, as well as outlining the temporal dynamics of these emotions. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",doi,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2012.10.015,Scopus,Neuropsychologia,"Giorgetta C., Grecucci A., Bonini N., Coricelli G., Demarchi G., Braun C., Sanfey A.G.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,"Web Addiction In The Brain: Cortical Oscillations, Autonomic Activity, And Behavioral Measures","Background and aims: Internet addiction (IA) was recently defined as a disorder tagging both the impulse control and the reward systems. Specifically, inhibitory deficits and reward bias were considered highly relevant in IA. This research aims to examine the electrophysiological correlates and autonomic activity [skin conductance response (SCR) and heart rate] in two groups of young subjects (N = 25), with high or low IA profile [tested by the Internet Addiction Test (IAT)], with specific reference to gambling behavior. Methods: Oscillatory brain activity (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma) and autonomic and behavioral measures [response times (RTs) and error rates (ERs)] were acquired during the performance of a Go/NoGo task in response to high-rewarding (online gambling videos and video games) or neutral stimuli. Results: A better performance (reduced ERs and reduced RTs) was revealed for high IAT in the case of NoGo trials representing rewarding cues (inhibitory control condition), probably due to a ""gain effect"" induced by the rewarding condition. In addition, we also observed for NoGo trials related to gambling and video games stimuli that (a) increased low-frequency band (delta and theta) and SCR and (b) a specific lateralization effect (more left-side activity) delta and theta in high IAT. Discussion: Both inhibitory control deficits and reward bias effect were considered to explain IA. © 2017 The Author(s).",doi,10.1556/2006.6.2017.041,Scopus,Journal of Behavioral Addictions,"Balconi M., Campanella S., Finocchiaro R.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,What's In A Name? Ages And Names Predict The Valence Of Social Interactions In A Massive Online Game,"Multi-player online battle arena games (MOBAs) are large virtual environments requiring complex problem-solving and social interaction. We asked whether these games generate psychologically interesting data about the players themselves. Specifically, we asked whether user names, which are chosen by players outside of the game itself, predicted in-game behaviour. To examine this, we analysed a large anonymized dataset from a popular MOBA ('League of Legends') - by some measures the most popular game in the world. We find that user names contain two pieces of information that correlate with in-game social behaviour. Both player age (estimated from numerical sequences within name) and the presence of highly anti-social words are correlated with the valences of player/player interactions within the game. Our findings suggest that players' real-world characteristics influence behaviour and interpersonal interactions within online games. Anonymized statistics derived from such games may therefore be a valuable tool for studying psychological traits across global populations. © 2015 The Authors.

,What's Keeping Teenagers Up? Prebedtime Behaviors And Actigraphy-Assessed Sleep Over School And Vacation,"Purpose Technology-related behaviors (e.g., computer use) before bedtime (BT) have been associated with poorer and shorter sleep in adolescents; however, less is known about other behaviors in relation to sleep. This study characterized a range of behaviors in the hour before bed (i.e., pre-BT behaviors [PBBs]) and examined their relationship with sleep parameters during school and vacation periods (i.e., restricted and extended sleep opportunities, respectively). Mechanistic roles of chronotype and cognitive presleep arousal (PSAcog) were also examined. Methods During the last week of a school term and throughout a 2-week vacation, 146 adolescents (47.26% male, age M ± standard deviation = 16.2 ± 1.0 years) from the general community completed daily sleep measure using actigraphy, self-report measures on PBBs and PSAcog (Presleep Arousal Scale) for both school and vacation periods, and chronotype (Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire). Results Adolescents engaged in a variety of behaviors before bed. Notably, playing video games was associated with significantly later school and vacation BT and shorter school sleep duration (controlling for chronotype). During vacation, online social media was associated with significantly longer sleep onset latency, and this relationship was mediated by higher PSAcog. In contrast, on school nights, spending time with family was associated with significantly earlier BT and longer sleep duration. Conclusions Technology-related PBBs video games and online social media were risk factors for shorter and poorer sleep, whereas time with family was protective of sleep duration. In addressing sleep problems in adolescents, therapeutic procedures that target the potentially addictive nature of technology use and reduce PSAcog were implicated. © 2016 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

,When Bad Emotions Seem Better: Experience Changes The Automatic Evaluation Of Anger,"Evaluations of objects change as a function of our experience with them. We suggest that this also applies to the evaluation of emotions. In three studies, we show that the evaluation of anger changes as a function of direct experience with anger. We found that the experience of anger in a context in which it could be beneficial (i.e., an aggressive computer game) led people to perceive anger as more useful (Study 1). Moreover, people came to evaluate anger less negatively after experiencing anger in a context in which it could be beneficial. These changes did not result from the mere experience of anger or from exposure to an aggressive context (Study 2). Rather, the more anger improved their performance, the less negatively participants came to evaluate anger (Study 3). These findings suggest that how bad anger seems may depend on our direct experience with it. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.",doi,10.1177/1948550615584198,Scopus,Social Psychological and Personality Science,"Netzer L., Igra L., Anan Y.B., Tamir M.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Whistle-Blowing: Not Always A Losing Game,"The experiences of five engineers in nuclear power, aerospace, and air-traffic control who followed their consciences are recounted. In one case, which took place in 1976, three engineers quit General Electric Co.'s nuclear division to protest alleged inadequate testing and unsafe designs, not only at GE but throughout the nuclear industry. In 1981, a Federal Aviation Administration engineer appeared on a television show charging that lives have been lost because of the agency's mishandling of collision avoidance system development. In 1986, engineers at Morton Thiokol Inc. warned against the launch of the space shuttle Challenger because low temperatures predicted for the next morning might stiffen 0-rings. In all three cases, the whistle-blowers have by now been vindicated to a degree for their actions, though the verdict may not be unanimous, and the careers of the first group may have even benefited by blowing the whistle.",doi,10.1109/6.60938,Scopus,IEEE Spectrum,Fitzgerald Karen,1990,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Wildlife Use Of Water Catchments In Southwestern Arizona,"Construction of water developments has been used as a wildlife-habitat improvement technique in desert environments since the 1940s. Use of water developments by wildlife has been described in anecdotal observations, through water-hole counts, and with triggered still-cameras, but few studies have directly quantified wildlife use. We used video surveillance equipment to document wildlife use of 3 water catchments located in the Sonoran Desert, southwestern Arizona, USA, from June 2000 to November 2003. For each visitation, we recorded time of day, season of use, and activities engaged in, and we correlated visits with temperature and relative humidity. We logged 37,989 observation hours and documented 34 species using the water catchments. Most of the species recorded visited water catchments year-round with use peaking during June and July. The number of visits by nongame species (i.e., bats, raptors, mammalian predators, and rodents) exceeded the number of visits by game species (mule deer [Odocoileus hemionus], doves [Zenaida spp.], and Gambel's quail [Callipepia gambelii]). Visitation frequency for turkey vultures (Cathartes aura), owls, diurnal raptors, mule deer, coyotes (Canis latrans), and other mammalian predators increased with temperature. Most visits culminated in the animal drinking water. Other activities recorded were bathing, consumption of plant material and carrion, and intraspecies and interspecies interactions. We recorded 8 predation attempts: 4 by avian predators and 4 by bobcats (Lynx rufus). Although we documented that a number of species frequented water catchments, our observations do not prove need. However, we believe our observations do provide support for constructing water catchments that can accommodate a wide diversity of species.",doi,10.2193/0091-7648(2006)34[582:WUOWCI]2.0.CO;2,Scopus,Wildlife Society Bulletin,"O'Brien C.S., Waddell R.B., Rosenstock S.S., Rabe M.J.",2006,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Women's Comedy Preferences During The Menstrual Cycle,"Females in different phases of their menstrual cycle were given the opportunity to select comedy, drama, and game-show programs for an evening's worth of watching television. Additionally, they rated their enjoyment of a battery of cartoons and watched excerpts from several television programs. It was found that premenstrual and menstrual women preferred comedy over alternative choices more strongly than did women midway through the cycle. It is suggested that this preference reflects a desire to overcome the hormonally mediated noxious mood states that are characteristically associated with the premenstrual and menstrual phases of the cycle. Appreciation of humor and comedy was not found to vary with cycle phases, however. © 1987, Sage.

,[Factors On Internet Game Addiction Among Adolescents].,"The purpose of this study was to explore factors related to internet game addiction for adolescents. This study was a cross-sectional survey, and data was collected through self-report questionnaires. Data was analyzed using the SPSS program. In logistic regression analysis, the risk of being addicted to internet games was 2.22 times higher in males than females. Adolescents with low and middle academic performance also had a higher risk(2.08 times and 2.54 times) to become addicted to internet games. For the location of the computer, the risk of becoming addicted to internet games were .01 times lower in the living room or brother or sisters' room than in their own room. The risk of becoming addicted to internet games was 1.18 times higher in the higher usage time of internet games. The risk of becoming addicted to internet games was .49 times lower in the more accepting and autonomic parents' rearing attitude and .02 times lower in the high self-efficacy group than the low group.

,3D Cpr Game Can Improve Cpr Skill Retention.,"Adequate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) skill is essential in improving survival rate of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). However, the skill deteriorates rapidly following CPR training. We developed a computer game by using 3-Dimensional virtual technology (3-D CPR game) for laypersons in the purpose to improve skill retention. As the testing phase, a randomized control trial, in which we recruited 97 freshman medical students who had no prior CPR training experience, was used to test its effect on 3-month CPR Skill retention. The usability of the game was also tested using a 33 item questionnaire rated with 5-point Likert scale. Three months after the initial CPR training, the retention rate of CPR skill in the game group was significantly higher compared with the control (p&amp;lt;0.05) and the average score on 4 dimensions of usability were 3.99-4.05. Overall, using 3-D CPR game in improving CPR skill retention is feasible and effective.",pmid,26262276,pubmed,Studies in health technology and informatics,"Li, Jia; Xu, Yimin; Xu, Yahong; Yue, Peng; Sun, Liu; Guo, Ming; Xiao, Shuqin; Ding, Shu; Cui, Yanyan; Li, Shulan; Yang, Qiuying; Chang, Polun; Wu, Ying",2016,NA,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,A Randomized Field Trial Of Acindes: A Child-Centered Training Model For Children With Chronic Illnesses (Asthma And Epilepsy),"A randomized field trial of a child-centered model of training for self- management of chronic illnesses was conducted of 355 Spanish-speaking school-aged children, between 6 and 15 years old, with moderate to severe asthma and epilepsy, in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The model, based on play techniques, consists of five weekly meetings of 8-10 families, with children's and parents' groups held simultaneously, coordinated by specially trained teachers and outside the hospital environment. Children are trained to assume a leading role in the management of their health; parents learn to be facilitators; and physicians provide guidance, acting as counselors. Group activities include games, drawings, stories, videos, and role-playing. Children and parents were interviewed at home before the program and 6 and 12 months after the program, and medical and school records were monitored for emergency and routine visits, hospitalizations, and school absenteeism. In asthma and epilepsy, children in the experiment showed significant improvements in knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors compared to controls (probability of experimental gain over controls = .69 for epilepsy and .56 for asthma, with σ2 = .007 and .016, respectively). Parent participants in the experiment had improved knowledge of asthma (39% before vs. 58% after) and epilepsy (22% before vs. 56% after), with a probability of gain = .62 (σ2 = .0026) with respect to the control group. Similar positive outcomes were found in fears of child death (experimental 39% before vs. 4% after for asthma, 69% before vs. 30% after for epilepsy), as well as in disruption of family life and patient-physician relationship, while controls showed no change. Regarding clinical variables, for both asthma and epilepsy, children in the experimental group had significantly fewer crises than the controls after the groups (P = .036 and P = .026). Visits to physicians showed a significant decrease for those with asthma (P = .048), and emergency visits decreased for those with epilepsy (P = .046). An 18-item Children Health Locus of Control Scale (CHLCS) showed a significant increase in internality in experimental group children with asthma and epilepsy (P &lt; .01), while controls did not change or performed worse 12 months after the program. School absenteeism was reduced significantly for those with asthma and epilepsy (for the group with asthma, fall/winter P = .006, and spring P = .029; for the group with epilepsy, P = .011). Conclusion. The program was successful in improving the health, activity, and quality of life of children with asthma and epilepsy. The data suggested that an autonomous (Piagetian) model of training is a key to this success, reinforcing children's autonomous decision making.",pmid,10856009,Scopus,Journal of Urban Health,"Tieffenberg J.A., Wood E.I., Alonso A., Tossutti M.S., Vicente M.F.",2e3,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,A Randomized Prospective Study Of The Use Of Ipads In Reducing Anxiety During Cast Room Procedures.,"Cast room procedures can be a source of anxiety for children. Various techniques, including music therapy, have been evaluated as a way to ease this anxiety. The use of iPads as a form of distraction during cast room procedures has not previously been evaluated and was the purpose of the current study. 146 children and adolescents who underwent cast room procedures during June- August 2015 were randomly assigned to one of three groups: no-iPad, iPad with video, or iPad with game. Patient heart rates were measured using a pulse oximeter in the waiting room, before the procedure, during the procedure, and after the procedure. Mean values for each group were calculated at each time interval and compared both between groups and within groups over time. There were no significant differences in baseline (waiting room) heart rate between the no-iPad and iPad groups. When compared with the no-iPad group, there was a trend toward decreased heart rate in the video group (p=0.13) and a significant increase in heart rate in the game group (p=0.026) before the procedure. There were no significant decreases in heart rate within any of the groups when comparing the waiting room heart rates with the during procedure heart rates. There was a significant difference between the no-iPad and video groups (p=0.047) when comparing the change in heart rate from baseline to before the procedure, with a decreased heart rate observed in the video group. The results of this study show a significant decrease in heart rate when transitioning from the waiting room to the cast room while watching videos on the iPad. iPad-based video delivery appears to decrease anxiety prior to cast room procedures. iPad-based game play is difficult to assess as elevations in heart rate prior to the procedure are presumed to be related to game play and confound the observed effect it may have on anxiety related to the procedure.",pmid,27528849,pubmed,The Iowa orthopaedic journal,"Ko, Justine S; Whiting, Zachariah; Nguyen, Cynthia; Liu, Raymond W; Gilmore, Allison",2017,NA,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Activity Profiles And Demands Of Seasonal And Tournament Basketball Competition,"Competition-specific conditioning for tournament basketball games is challenging, as the demands of tournament formats are not well characterized. Purpose: To compare the physical, physiological, and tactical demands of seasonal and tournament basketball competition and determine the pattern of changes within an international tournament. Methods: Eight elite junior male basketball players (age 17.8 ± 0.2 y, height 1.93 ± 0.07 m, mass 85 ± 3 kg; mean ± SD) were monitored in 6 seasonal games played over 4 mo in an Australian second-division national league and in 7 games of an international under-18 tournament played over 8 days. Movement patterns and tactical elements were coded from video and heart rates recorded by telemetry. Results: The frequency of running, sprinting, and shuffling movements in seasonal games was higher than in tournament games by 8-15% (99% confidence limits ± ~8%). Within the tournament, jogging and low- to medium-intensity shuffling decreased by 15-20% (± ∼14%) over the 7 games, while running, sprinting, and high-intensity shuffling increased 11-81% (± ∼25%). There were unclear differences in mean and peak heart rates. The total number of possessions was higher in seasonal than in tournament games by 8% (± 10%). Conclusions: Coaches should consider a stronger emphasis on strength and power training in their conditioning programs to account for the higher activity of seasonal games. For tournament competition, strategies that build a sufficient aerobic capacity and neuromuscular resilience to maintain high-intensity movements need to be employed. A focus on half-court tactics accounts for the lower number of possessions in tournaments. © 2013 Human Kinetics, Inc.",pmid,23479394,Scopus,International Journal of Sports Physiology and Performance,"Klusemann M.J., Pyne D.B., Hopkins W.G., Drinkwater E.J.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas

,Combining Computer Game-Based Behavioural Experiments With High-Density Eeg And Infrared Gaze Tracking.,"Experimental paradigms are valuable insofar as the timing and other parameters of their stimuli are well specified and controlled, and insofar as they yield data relevant to the cognitive processing that occurs under ecologically valid conditions. These two goals often are at odds, since well controlled stimuli often are too repetitive to sustain subjects' motivation. Studies employing electroencephalography (EEG) are often especially sensitive to this dilemma between ecological validity and experimental control: attaining sufficient signal-to-noise in physiological averages demands large numbers of repeated trials within lengthy recording sessions, limiting the subject pool to individuals with the ability and patience to perform a set task over and over again. This constraint severely limits researchers' ability to investigate younger populations as well as clinical populations associated with heightened anxiety or attentional abnormalities. Even adult, non-clinical subjects may not be able to achieve their typical levels of performance or cognitive engagement: an unmotivated subject for whom an experimental task is little more than a chore is not the same, behaviourally, cognitively, or neurally, as a subject who is intrinsically motivated and engaged with the task. A growing body of literature demonstrates that embedding experiments within video games may provide a way between the horns of this dilemma between experimental control and ecological validity. The narrative of a game provides a more realistic context in which tasks occur, enhancing their ecological validity (Chaytor & Schmitter-Edgecombe, 2003). Moreover, this context provides motivation to complete tasks. In our game, subjects perform various missions to collect resources, fend off pirates, intercept communications or facilitate diplomatic relations. In so doing, they also perform an array of cognitive tasks, including a Posner attention-shifting paradigm (Posner, 1980), a go/no-go test of motor inhibition, a psychophysical motion coherence threshold task, the Embedded Figures Test (Witkin, 1950, 1954) and a theory-of-mind (Wimmer & Perner, 1983) task. The game software automatically registers game stimuli and subjects' actions and responses in a log file, and sends event codes to synchronise with physiological data recorders. Thus the game can be combined with physiological measures such as EEG or fMRI, and with moment-to-moment tracking of gaze. Gaze tracking can verify subjects' compliance with behavioural tasks (e.g. fixation) and overt attention to experimental stimuli, and also physiological arousal as reflected in pupil dilation (Bradley et al., 2008). At great enough sampling frequencies, gaze tracking may also help assess covert attention as reflected in microsaccades - eye movements that are too small to foveate a new object, but are as rapid in onset and have the same relationship between angular distance and peak velocity as do saccades that traverse greater distances. The distribution of directions of microsaccades correlates with the (otherwise) covert direction of attention (Hafed & Clark, 2002).",pmid,21206465,Scopus,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,"Yoder K.J., Belmonte M.K.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Decreased Ventral Anterior Cingulate Cortex Activity Is Associated With Reduced Social Pain During Emotional Support.,"People feel psychological pain when they are excluded, and this pain is often attenuated when emotional support is received. It is therefore likely that a specific neural mechanism underlies the detection of social exclusion. Similarly, specific neural mechanisms may underlie the beneficial effects of emotional support. Although neuroimaging researchers have recently examined the neural basis of social pain, there is presently no agreement as to which part of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is involved in the perception and modulation of social pain. We hypothesized that activity in those brain regions that are associated with social pain would be correlated with decrements in social pain induced by emotional support. To examine the effects of emotional support on social pain caused by exclusion, we conducted an fMRI study in which participants played a virtual ball-tossing game. Participants were initially included and later excluded from the game. In the latter half of the session from which participants were excluded, participants received emotionally supportive text messages. We found that emotional support led to increased activity in the left lateral/medial prefrontal cortices and some temporal regions. Those individuals who experienced greater attenuation of social pain exhibited lower ventral ACC and higher left lateral prefrontal cortex activation. These results suggest that the ventral ACC underlies social pain, and that emotional support enhances prefrontal cortex activity, which in turn may lead to a weakened affective response.",pmid,19562631,Scopus,Social neuroscience,"Onoda K., Okamoto Y., Nakashima K., Nittono H., Ura M., Yamawaki S.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Do Exergames Allow Children To Achieve Physical Activity Intensity Commensurate With National Guidelines?,"The purpose of this study was to determine if two popular exergames, Wii Fit™ and EA Sports Active™, both games for the Nintendo Wii™ console, help children achieve intensity consistent with recommended physical activity guidelines. Thirty children (19 males and 11 females, Mean age = 9.4 ± 1.8 years) participated in this study by playing each game during one research session. During the session participants wore a heart rate monitor and accelerometer to measure exercise intensity. Perceived exertion (RPE) was measured with the children's run/walk OMNI scale. All three measures of exercise intensity (heart rate, accelerometer counts, and RPE) found that the EA Sports Active™ game session elicited higher exercise intensity. However, heart rate data found both games to achieve moderate intensity (65-68% age-predicted HRmax). When using heart rate as an indicator of exercise intensity it appears that both exergames were of sufficient intensity to achieve physical activity guidelines. Future studies should continue to investigate the utility of exergaming in helping children to become more physically active.",pmid,27182367,pubmed,International journal of exercise science,"Perron, Rachel M; Graham, Courtney A; Feldman, Jamie R; Moffett, Rebecca A; Hall, Eric E",2017,NA,NA,reviewer2,Andreas

,Getting The Attention You Need.,"Employees have an enormous amount of business information at their fingertips--more specifically, at their desktops. The floodgates are open; profitable possibilities abound. But having to handle all that information has pushed downsized staffs to the brink of an acute attention deficit disorder. To achieve corporate goals, business leaders need their employees' full attention--and that attention is in short supply. Authors Thomas Davenport and John Beck have studied how companies manage the attention of their employees and their site visitors. In this article, they analyze the components of attention management through three lenses--economic, psychobiological, and technological--and offer guidelines for keeping employees focused on crucial corporate tasks. Their lessons are drawn from the best practices employed by today's stickiest Web sites and by traditional attention industries such as advertising, film, and television. The authors say executives must manage attention knowing that it's a zero-sum game (there's only so much to go around). Managers should also consider capitalizing on the basic survival and competitive instincts we all have that help determine how much attention we pay to certain things. For instance, the threat of corporate demise--and the consequent loss of jobs and livelihoods--undoubtedly focuses workers' attention on the need to change. Likewise, internal competition among business units may give employees added incentive to pay attention to a profit or sales goal. Leaders today need to pay more attention to attention because it's widely misunderstood and widely mismanaged, the authors conclude.",pmid,11143148,Scopus,Harvard business review,"Davenport T.H., Beck J.C.",2e3,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,"Hemodynamic Function At Rest, During Acute Stress, And In The Field: Predictors Of Cardiac Structure And Function 2 Years Later In Youth","Left ventricular hypertrophy is an independent predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, predictors of cardiac structure and function in youth are not completely understood. On 2 occasions (2.3 years apart), we examined 146 youth aged initially 10 to 19 years (mean age, 14.2 ± 1.8 years). On the initial visit, hemodynamic function was assessed at rest, during laboratory stress (ie, orthostasis, car-driving simulation, video game, and forehead cold), and in the field (ie, ambulatory blood pressure). Quantitative M-mode echocardiograms were obtained on both visits. On both visits, black compared with white youth had higher resting laboratory systolic blood pressure (P&lt;0.02), greater relative wall thickness (P&lt;0.003), greater left ventricular mass indexed by either body surface area or height2.7 (P&lt;0.01 for both), and lower midwall fractional shortening ratio (P&lt;0.05). Hierarchical stepwise regression analysis indicated that significant independent predictors of follow-up left ventricular mass/height2.7 were the initial evaluation of left ventricular mass/height2.7, body mass index, gender (males more than females), and supine resting total peripheral resistance (final model R2=0.53). Left ventricular mass/body surface area was predicted by initial left ventricular mass/body surface area, weight, gender, mean supine resting total peripheral resistance, and systolic pressure response to car-driving simulation (final model R2=0.48). Midwall fractional shortening was predicted by initial midwall fractional shortening, race (white more than black), and lower mean supine total peripheral resistance (final model R2=0.13).

The results of this study indicate that customization of game avatars can affect both subjective feelings of presence and psychophysiological indicators of emotion during gameplay, which may make the gameplay experience more enjoyable. This may have implications for game sponsors and producers. Self-reported presence had no effect on psychophysiological indicators of emotion during gameplay.

Following observations of ethics and public reactions to media, we propose that fictional contexts, such as reality, imagination, and virtual environments, will mitigate people's moral condemnation of harm violations, more so than purity violations. That is, imagining a purely harmful act is given a ""fictive pass,"" in moral judgment, whereas imagining an abnormal act involving the body is evaluated more negatively because it is seen as more diagnostic of bad character. For Experiment 1, an undergraduate sample (N = 250) evaluated 9 vignettes depicting an agent committing either violations of harm or purity in real life, watching them in films, or imagining them. For Experiments 2 and 3, online participants (N = 375 and N = 321, respectively) evaluated a single vignette depicting an agent committing a violation of harm or purity that either occurred in real life, was imagined, watched in a film, or performed in a video game. Experiment 4 (N = 348) used an analysis of moderated mediation to demonstrate that the perceived wrongness of fictional purity violations is explained both by the extent to which they are seen as a cue to, and a cause of, a poor moral character. Lastly, Experiment 5 (N = 484) validated our manipulations and included the presumption of desire as an additional mediator of the fictive pass asymmetry effects. We discuss implications for moral theories of act and character, anger and disgust, and for media use and regulation. © 2017 American Psychological Association.",pmid,28054817,Scopus,Journal of Experimental Psychology: General,"Sabo J.S., Giner-Sorolla R.",2017,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Laterality Of Brain Activation For Risk Factors Of Addiction,"Background: Laterality of brain activation is reported for tests of risk factors of addiction - impulsivity and craving - but authors rarely address the potential significance of those asymmetries. Objective: The purpose of this study is to demonstrate this laterality and discuss its relevance to cognitive and neurophysiological asymmetries associated with drug abuse vulnerability in order to provide new insights for future research in drug abuse. Method: From published reports, brain areas of activation for two tests of response inhibition or craving for drugs of abuse were compiled from fMRI activation peaks and were tabulated for eight sections (octants) in each hemisphere. Percent asymmetries were calculated (R-L/R+L) across studies for each area. Results: For impulsivity, most activation peaks favored the right hemisphere. Overall, the percent difference was 32% (Χ2 = 16.026; p &lt; 0.0001) with the greater asymmetry for anterior peaks (46.8%; Χ2 = 17.329; p &lt; 0.0001). The asymmetries for cue-induced craving were opposite, favoring the left hemisphere by 6.7% (Χ2 = 4.028; p &lt; 0.05). The consistency of left asymmetry was found for almost all drugs. For nicotine, studies where subjects were not allowed to smoke (deprived) prior to measurement had the same left hemisphere activation but those who smoked (satiated) before the fMRI measure showed right asymmetry. Conclusion: Brain activation studies demonstrate different left/right hemispheric contributions for impulsivity versus craving - factors related to addiction. Failure to take laterality into consideration is a missed opportunity in designing studies and gaining insight into the etiology of drug abuse and pathways for treatment. © 2016 Bentham Science Publishers.",pmid,26674074,Scopus,Current Drug Abuse Reviews,Gordon H.W.,2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Longitudinal Association Of Cardiovascular Reactivity And Blood Pressure In Samoan Adolescents,"Objective: The longitudinal association between blood pressure (BP) reactivity to a video game and resting BP 3 to 4 years later was investigated in 83 Samoan adolescent from American and (Western) Samoa as part of a multidisciplinary study of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in modern Samoans. Methods: Participants ranged in age from 11 to 14 years at baseline, in 1992 to 1993, and 14 to 18 years at follow-up in 1996. Video game BP reactivity was defined as the residual score of the regression of the maximum BP during the video game on the minimum resting BP before the video game. The predictive effect of baseline video game BP reactivity on follow-up resting BP was tested using regression models with baseline resting BP, baseline body mass index (BMI), and age as covariates. Results: Systolic BP reactivity to the video game at baseline was significantly, p = .04, and independently associated with resting systolic BP 3 to 4 years later. Samoan adolescent who had higher systolic BP reactivity scores at baseline had significantly higher resting systolic BP at follow-up after adjustment for the significant effects of baseline resting systolic BP, age, and BMI. There were no interactions between sex and reactivity or between residence, American Samoa or (Western) Samoa, and reactivity in the models, indicating that the effects of systolic BP reactivity in early adolescence on later adolescent resting systolic BP were similar in the entire study sample. Conclusions: Video game cardiovascular reactivity seems to assess aspects of psychophysiological arousal and prospective CVD risk in Samoan adolescent of both sexes residing in both Samoas, and may be useful for understanding the role of psychosocial stress and health in modernizing societies.",pmid,10204978,Scopus,Psychosomatic Medicine,"Newman J.D., Mcgarvey S.T., Steele M.S.",1999,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Memory For Friends Or Foes: The Social Context Of Past Encounters With Faces Modulates Their Subsequent Neural Traces In The Brain.,"Every day we encounter new people, interact with them, and form person impressions based on quick and automatic inferences from minimal contextual information. Previous studies have identified an extensive network of brain areas involved in familiar face recognition, but there is little evidence to date concerning the neural bases of negative vs. positive person impressions. In the present study, participants were repeatedly exposed to 16 unfamiliar face identities within a pseudo-interactive game context to generate a perception of either ""friends"" or ""foes"". Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was then performed during an old/new memory task to assess any difference in brain responses to these now familiar face identities, relative to unfamiliar faces. Importantly, whereas facial expressions were always emotional (either smiling or angry) during the encoding phase, they were always neutral during the memory task. Our results reveal that several brain regions involved in familiar face recognition, including fusiform cortex, posterior cingulate gyrus, and amygdala, plus additional areas involved in motivational control such as caudate and anterior cingulate cortex, were differentially modulated as a function of a previous encounter, and generally more activated when faces were perceived as ""foes"" rather than ""friends"". These findings underscore that a key dimension of social judgments, based on past impressions of who may be supportive or hostile, may lead to long-lasting effects on memory for faces and thus influence affective reactions to people during a subsequent encounter even in a different (neutral) context.",pmid,19637101,Scopus,Social neuroscience,"Vrticka P., Andersson F., Sander D., Vuilleumier P.",2009,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Multi-Point Flicker Recognition Apparatus And Its Application For Video Display Terminal Work.,"The apparatus to measure multi-point critical flicker fusion frequency (MCFF) was devised for more precise determination of the critical flicker fusion frequency (CFF). Using this apparatus, the variations in flicker value after the work load of the television (TV) game, the Kraepelin using the video display terminal (VDT-Kraepelin) and the paper-Kraepelin were examined in order to test its practical applicability. The following results were obtained. The degree of decrease in the CFF values of some peripheral eye fields was larger than that on the central field of both eyes (ordinary CFF) after work load. The variation rates of the central and the peripheral flicker values were measured before and after loading in each work, and the correlations of variation rates between two CFF values among them were calculated. The numbers of peripheral eye fields showing significant correlation of variation rates between two eye fields in the TV game and the VDT-Kraepelin, were greater than those in the paper-Kraepelin.",pmid,3565072,Scopus,Acta Medica Okayama,"Yunoki E., Osaki H., Ogata M.",1987,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,"Parental History Of Hypertension, Sodium Loading, And Cardiovascular Response To Stress","Parental history of hypertension, dietary sodium, and psychological stress have all been implicated in the development of essential hypertension and may interact in elevating disease risk.The mechanism by which this might occur is unclear, but it may be related to changes in the peripheral vasculature. The present study examined the effects of parental history and sodium on cardiovascular responses to an extended stressor. Eighteen normotensive offspring of hypertensives and 18 offspring of normotensives were exposed to a 1-hour shock-avoidance video-game procedure after 14 days of sodium loading (10 1-g tablets/day) and again after 14 days of placebo tablets. Order of sessions was counterbalanced between subjects in a double-blind design. In offspring of hypertensives, sodium loading elevated total peripheral resistance and norepinephrine responses to stress relative to placebo conditions and compared with offspring of normotensives. These increases were accompanied by decreases in stroke volume and cardiac output, which may explain the absence of familial differences in blood pressure responses to stress and sodium. Sodium loading had no effect on offspring of normotensives. The elevated resistance in offspring of hypertensives may suggest the initiation of pathological processes. The absence of sodium effects on resting values indicates the importance of research under conditions of stress. © 1995 by American Psychosomatic Society.",pmid,7480568,Scopus,Psychosomatic Medicine,"Miller S.B., Friese M., Sita A.",1995,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,"Physiologic Responses, Liking And Motivation For Playing The Same Video Game On An Active Versus A Traditional, Non-Active Gaming System.","Evidence suggests that individuals playing certain video games on the Nintendo Wii® (Wii) exhibit increased energy expenditure versus traditional video games, although little research examines non-Wii Sports/Fit games. The purpose of this study is to assess physiologic responses, liking, and the relative reinforcing value (RRV) of a popular, non-Wii sports video game for the Wii relative to the same game played on a traditional, non-active system. Twenty-four college-aged students participated. Heart rate and oxygen consumption (V̇O2) was assessed during rest and when playing the following games: Madden NFL 2011® for Playstation 2 (PS2 Madden) and the Wii (Wii Madden), and Wii Sports Boxing. The RRV was assessed for Wii Madden versus PS2 Madden. Analysis of variance demonstrated a main effect for condition (p ≤ 0.01) as V̇O2 (5.2 ± 0.2 ml·kg-1·min-1 Wii, 4.1 ± 0.1 ml·kg-1·min-1 PS2, 3.7 ± 0.1 ml·kg-1·min-1, rest) and heart rate (89.2 · 2.7 bpm Wii, 79.7 ± 2.5 bpm PS2, 79.1 ± 2.5 bpm, rest) was greater for Wii Madden than PS2 Madden and rest. Heart Rate (105.4 ± 5.3 bpm) and V̇O2 (10.4 ml·kg-1·min-1) for Wii Sports Boxing was significantly greater than all other conditions (p ≤ 0.003). The RRV was not significantly different between Wii Madden and PS2 Madden (p = 0.50). Compared to the same game on a traditional system, Wii Madden is more physiologically challenging and equally reinforcing. However, Wii Madden would not be categorized as moderate-intensity physical activity.",pmid,27182381,pubmed,International journal of exercise science,"Sanders, Gabriel J; Santo, Antonio S; Peacock, Corey A; Williamson, Megan L; VON Carlowitz, Kyle-Patrick; Barkley, Jacob E",2017,NA,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Physiological Demands And Activity Profiles During Futsal Match Play According To Competitive Level,"Aim. The aims of this study were to examine and compare the physiological demands and activity profiles of players at dif-ferent competitive levels during futsal match play. Methods. Fifteen professional futsal players (elite group) and 15 university futsal players (amateur group) participated in the study. The players in each group were divided into th-ree teams; each team consisted of 1 goalkeeper and 4 outfield players. All players were observed during two match simu-lated competitive games. The physiological demands were analyzed by measuring heart rate, estimated V•O2 from an individual HR-V•O2 relationship, and earlobe-blood lactate concentration before and at the end of the match. Activity profiles were analyzed for whole game movement patterns using a computer-based tracking system. Results. The physiological demands of the outfield players in the elite group was higher (P&lt;0.05) than in the amateur group (%HRmax: 89.8±5.8 vs. 86.2±6.7%, %V•O2max: 77.9±9 vs. 73.1±6.2% and blood lactate: 5.5±1.4 vs. 5.1±1.5 mmol/L, respectively). Analysis of activity profiles of outfield players showed that the total distance covered of the elite group was higher (P&lt;0.05) than that of the amateur group: (5087±1104 vs. 4528±1248 m, respectively). However, there were no sig-nificant differences in the physiological demands and activity profiles between the goalkeepers in the two groups (P&gt;0.05). Conclusion. These results demonstrate that the higher physi-ological demands and activity profiles placed on elite players during the game could indicate the players' physical fitness reserves for the formulation of an optimized specific train-ing program as well as being useful in the preparation of the athletes for competition.",pmid,22828458,Scopus,Journal of Sports Medicine and Physical Fitness,"Makaje N., Ruangthai R., Arkarapanthu A., Yoopat P.",2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Psycho-Physiological Training Approach For Amputee Rehabilitation,"Electromyography (EMG) signals are very noisy and difficult to acquire. Conventional techniques involve amplification and filtering through analog circuits, which makes the system very unstable. The surface EMG signals lie in the frequency range of 6Hz to 600Hz, and the dominant range is between the ranges from 20Hz to 150Hz. Our project aimed to analyze an EMG signal effectively over its complete frequency range. To remove these defects, we designed what we think is an easy, effective, and reliable signal processing technique. We did spectrum analysis, so as to perform all the processing such as amplification, filtering, and thresholding on an Arduino Uno board, hence removing the need for analog amplifiers and filtering circuits, which have stability issues. The conversion of time domain to frequency domain of any signal gives a detailed data of the signal set. Our main aim is to use this useful data for an alternative methodology for rehabilitation called a psychophysiological approach to rehabilitation in prosthesis, which can reduce the cost of the myoelectric arm, as well as increase its efficiency. This method allows the user to gain control over their muscle sets in a less stressful environment. Further, we also have described how our approach is viable and can benefit the rehabilitation process. We used our DSP EMG signals to play an online game and showed how this approach can be used in rehabilitation. © Copyright AAMI 2015.",pmid,25793347,Scopus,Biomedical Instrumentation and Technology,"Dhal C., Wahi A.",2015,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Psychophysiological Interrelations And Reactivity Characteristics In Hypertensives.,"Two hundred three patients with essential hypertension (20- to 55-year-old men) were examined initially and at the end of a 1-year follow-up. Clinical, psychological, and psychophysiological methods were used. In the psychophysiological assessment, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), heart rate, and respiratory rate were recorded at rest and during various emotional stressors. Patients who exhibited a greater increase in blood pressure during psychological stress, in addition to an inherited predisposition to essential hypertension, had higher levels of assertiveness and interpersonal conflict. The differences in cardiovascular response to various emotional stressors depended on the psychological features of the hypertensive patients. An SBP increase during the performance of mental arithmetic correlated with anxiety level, whereas a DBP increase was associated with assertiveness. Changes in SBP and DBP during a stressful computer game correlated with the level of competitiveness and conflict. Hypertensive patients who exhibited an increase in blood pressure during the follow-up were characterized initially by a greater DBP increase during emotional stress and a longer recovery period.",pmid,3243219,Scopus,Health Psychology,"Aivazyan T.A., Zaitsev V.P., Khramelashvili V.V., Golanov E.V., Kichkin V.I.",1988,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Race And Cardiovascular Reactivity: A Neglected Relationship,"The magnitude of the cardiovascular response to stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. Psychological stress procedures have received increased usage as an alternative to expensive physical (exercise) stress procedures. In the present investigation, 213 healthy, black or white, male or female children between the ages of 6 and 18 years were exposed to the psychological stress of a video game. The video game challenge was administered by a black or a white experimenter and was played under three levels of increasing stress, 1) personal challenge, 2) experimenter's challenge, and 3) experimenter’s challenge accompanied by a financial incentive, while blood pressure and heart rate were monitored. Results indicated that the video games provoked significant and incremental cardiovascular reactivity across the games. Black children demonstrated significantly greater reactivity than white children; the racial difference was more reliably observed for systolic and diastolic blood pressure than for heart rate. Furthermore, the race of the experimenter exerted a significant effect and often interacted with the race of the child, such that greater reactivity occurred in same-race pairings than in mixed-race pairings. These results suggest that reactivity is affected by an individual's race and social milieu and that reactivity may be one mechanism responsible for the greater prevalence of hypertension among blacks. © 1986 American Heart Association, Inc.",pmid,3770868,Scopus,Hypertension,"Murphy J.K., Alpert B.S., Moes D.M., Somes G.W.",1986,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Racial Differences In Endothelin-1 At Rest And In Response To Acute Stress In Adolescent Males,"Blacks exhibit greater vasoconstriction-mediated blood pressure (BP) increases in response to stress than do whites. Endothelin-1 (ET-1), a potent vasoconstrictive peptide, has been proposed as having a role in racial differences in stress reactivity. We evaluated the hemodynamic and plasma ET- 1 levels of 41 (23 whites, 18 blacks, mean age 18.6 years) normotensive adolescent males at rest and in response to a video game challenge and forehead cold stimulation. Measurements were performed at catheter insertion and before and immediately after the 2 stressors, which were separated by 20- minute rest periods. Blacks exhibited higher absolute levels of diastolic blood pressure, total peripheral resistance index, or both in response to catheter insertion and to the video game challenge and during recovery from video game challenge and cold stimulation (P<0.05 for all). Blacks exhibited higher absolute levels of ET-1 at every evaluation point (P<0.05 for all) and greater increases in ET-1 in response to both stressors (ps<0.05). These findings suggest that altered endothelial function may be involved in racial differences in hemodynamic reactivity to stress and possibly in the development of essential hypertension.",pmid,10720585,Scopus,Hypertension,"Treiber F.A., Jackson R.W., Davis H., Pollock J.S., Kapuku G., Mensah G.A., Pollock D.M.",2e3,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Social Support As A Moderator Of Cardiovascular Reactivity In Women: A Test Of The Direct Effects And Buffering Hypotheses,"This study examines the possibility that social support operates as a moderator of cardiovascular reactivity in women.Two models by which social support may operate were examined: The direct effects and buffering models. Twenty-six subjects were exposed to four conditions while playing a video game: two levels of stress (low, high) and two levels of social support (alone, together). Blood pressure and heart rate were monitored continuously. Ratings of stress were obtained for each condition. Results indicated that the support manipulation produced significant main effects for diastolic blood pressure and stress ratings, with lower diastolic blood pressure and ratings observed in the ""together"" condition, and that the interaction between support and stress produced lower reactivity for the cardiovascular measures in the high stress (but not the low stress) condition. No interaction was found for the stress ratings. We conclude that the results provide support for both the buffering and direct effects models. Implications concerning the (within-subjects) design of the study and the stress ratings are discussed. © 1995 by American Psychosomatic Society.",pmid,7732154,Scopus,Psychosomatic Medicine,"Gerin W., Milner D., Chawla S., Pickering T.G.",1995,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,The Effect Of Presleep Video-Game Playing On Adolescent Sleep,"Study Objectives: Video-game use before bedtime has been linked with poor sleep outcomes for adolescents; however, experimental evidence to support this link is sparse. The present study investigated the capacity of presleep video-game playing to extend sleep latency and reduce subjective feelings of sleepiness in adolescents. The arousing psychophysiologic mechanisms involved and the impact of presleep video-game playing on sleep architecture were also explored. Method: Thirteen male adolescent ""evening types"" (mean age = 16.6 years, SD = 1.1) participated in a counterbalanced, within-subjects design with experimental (active video gaming) and control (passive DVD watching) conditions. The experiment was conducted in the Flinders University Sleep Research Laboratory. Results: Relative to the control condition, presleep video-game playing increased sleep-onset latency (Z = 2.45, p = .01) and reduced subjective sleepiness (Z = 2.36, p = .02) - but only slightly. Video gaming was related to changes in cognitive alertness (as measured by α power: p < 0.01) but not physiologic arousal (as measured by heart rate: p > 0.05). Contrary to previous findings, sleep architecture was unaffected (both rapid eye movement and slow wave sleep: p > 0.05). Conclusions: Results suggest the direct effect of presleep video-game playing on adolescent sleep may be more modest than previously thought, suggesting that surveys linking stimulating presleep activities to poor sleep need substantiating with empirical evidence.",pmid,20411697,Scopus,Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine,"Weaver E., Gradisar M., Dohnt H., Lovato N., Douglas P.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Upper Extremity Rehabilitation Of Children With Cerebral Palsy Using Accelerometer Feedback On A Multitouch Display.,"Cerebral palsy is a non-progressive neurological disorder caused by disturbances to the developing brain. Physical and occupational therapy, if started at a young age, can help minimizing complications such as joint contractures, and can improve limb range of motion and coordination. While current forms of therapy for children with cerebral palsy are effective in minimizing symptoms, many children find them boring or repetitive. We have designed a system for use in upper-extremity rehabilitation sessions, making use of a multitouch display. The system allows children to be engaged in interactive gaming scenarios, while intensively performing desired exercises. It supports games which require completion of specific stretching or coordination exercises using one or both hands, as well as games which use physical, or ""tangible"" input mechanisms. To encourage correct posture during therapeutic exercises, we use a wireless kinematic sensor, worn on the patient's trunk, as a feedback channel for the games. The system went through several phases of design, incorporating input from observations of therapy and clinical sessions, as well as feedback from medical professionals. This paper describes the hardware platform, presents the design objectives derived from our iterative design phases and meetings with clinical personnel, discusses our current game designs and identifies areas of future work.",pmid,21096413,Scopus,Conference proceedings : ...

,User Stress Detection In Human-Computer Interactions.,"The emerging research area of Affective Computing seeks to advance the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) by enabling computers to interact with users in ways appropriate to their affective states. Affect recognition, including the use of psychophysiologcal measures (e.g. heart rate), facial expressions, speech recognition etc. to derive an assessment of user affective state based on factors from the current task context, is an important foundation required for the development of Affective Computing. Our research focuses on the use of three physiological signals: Blood Volume Pulse (BVP), Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) and Pupil Diameter (PD), to automatically monitor the level of stress in computer users. This paper reports on the hardware and software instrumentation development and signal processing approach used to detect the stress level of a subject interacting with a computer, within the framework of a specific experimental task, which is called the 'Stroop Test'. For this experiment, a computer game was implemented and adapted to make the subject experience the Stroop Effect, evoked by the mismatch between the font color and the meaning of a certain word (name of a color) displayed, while his/her BVP, GSR and PD signals were continuously recorded. Several data processing techniques were applied to extract effective attributes of the stress level of the subjects throughout the experiment. Current results indicate that there exists interesting similarity among changes in those three signals and the shift in the emotional states when stress stimuli are applied to the interaction environment.",pmid,15850118,pubmed,Biomedical sciences instrumentation,"Zhai, Jing; Barreto, Armando B; Chin, Craig; Li, Chao",2005,NA,NA,reviewer2,Andreas

,Virtual Reality Immersion Method Of Distraction To Control Experimental Ischemic Pain,"Background: Virtual reality immersion has been advocated as a new effective adjunct to drugs for pain control. The attenuation of pain perception and unpleasantness has been attributed to the patient's attention being diverted from the real, external environment through immersion in a virtual environment transmitted by an interactive 3-D software computer program via a VR helmet. Objectives: To investigate w hether VR immersion can extend the amount of time subjects can tolerate ischemic tourniquet pain. Methods: The study group comprised 20 healthy adult volunteers. The pain was induced by an inflated blood pressure cuff during two separate, counterbalanced, randomized experimental conditions for each subject: One with VR and the control without VR exposure. The VR equipment consisted of a standard computer, a lightweight helmet and an interactive software game. Results: Tolerance time to ischemia was significantly longer for VR conditions than for those without (P < 0.001). Visual Analogue Scale (0-10) ratings were recorded for pain intensity, pain unpleasantness, and the time spent thinking about pain. Affective distress ratings of unpleasantness and of time spent thinking about pain were significantly lower during VR as compared with the control condition (P< 0.003 and 0.001 respectively). Conclusions: The VR method in pain control was shown to be beneficial. The relatively inexpensive equipment will facilitate the use of VR immersion in clinical situations. Future research is necessary to establish the optimal selection of clinical patients appropriate for VR pain therapy and the type of software required according to age, gender, personality, and cultural factors.",pmid,16671363,Scopus,Israel Medical Association Journal,"Magora F., Cohen S., Shochina M., Dayan E.",2006,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,"Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance - United States, 2015","Problem: Priority health-risk behaviors contribute to the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among youth and adults. Population-based data on these behaviors at the national, state, and local levels can help monitor the effectiveness of public health interventions designed to protect and promote the health of youth nationwide. Reporting Period Covered: September 2014-December 2015. Description of the System: The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) monitors six categories of priority health behaviors among youth and young adults: 1) behaviors that contribute to unintentional injuries and violence; 2) tobacco use; 3) alcohol and other drug use; 4) sexual behaviors related to unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; 5) unhealthy dietary behaviors; and 6) physical inactivity. In addition, YRBSS monitors the prevalence of obesity and asthma and other priority health behaviors. YRBSS includes a national school-based Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) conducted by CDC and state and large urban school district school-based YRBSs conducted by state and local education and health agencies. This report summarizes results for 118 health behaviors plus obesity, overweight, and asthma from the 2015 national survey, 37 state surveys, and 19 large urban school district surveys conducted among students in grades 9-12. Results: Results from the 2015 national YRBS indicated that many high school students are engaged in priority health-risk behaviors associated with the leading causes of death among persons aged 10-24 years in the United States. During the 30 days before the survey, 41.5% of high school students nationwide among the 61.3% who drove a car or other vehicle during the 30 days before the survey had texted or e-mailed while driving, 32.8% had drunk alcohol, and 21.7% had used marijuana. During the 12 months before the survey, 15.5% had been electronically bullied, 20.2% had been bullied on school property, and 8.6% had attempted suicide. Many high school students are engaged in sexual risk behaviors related to unintended pregnancies and STIs, including HIV infection. Nationwide, 41.2% of students had ever had sexual intercourse, 30.1% had had sexual intercourse during the 3 months before the survey (i.e., currently sexually active), and 11.5% had had sexual intercourse with four or more persons during their life. Among currently sexually active students, 56.9% had used a condom during their last sexual intercourse. Results from the 2015 national YRBS also indicated many high school students are engaged in behaviors associated with chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes. During the 30 days before the survey, 10.8% of high school students had smoked cigarettes and 7.3% had used smokeless tobacco. During the 7 days before the survey, 5.2% of high school students had not eaten fruit or drunk 100% fruit juices and 6.7% had not eaten vegetables. More than one third (41.7%) had played video or computer games or used a computer for something that was not school work for 3 or more hours per day on an average school day and 14.3% had not participated in at least 60 minutes of any kind of physical activity that increased their heart rate and made them breathe hard on at least 1 day during the 7 days before the survey. Further, 13.9% had obesity and 16.0% were overweight. Interpretation: Many high school students engage in behaviors that place them at risk for the leading causes of morbidity and mortality. The prevalence of most health behaviors varies by sex, race/ethnicity, and grade and across states and large urban school districts. Long-term temporal changes also have occurred. Since the earliest year of data collection, the prevalence of most healthrisk behaviors has decreased (e.g., riding with a driver who had been drinking alcohol, physical fighting, current cigarette use, current alcohol use, and current sexual activity), but the prevalence of other behaviors and health outcomes has not changed (e.g., uicide attempts treated by a doctor or nurse, smokeless tobacco use, having ever used marijuana, and attending physical education classes) or has increased (e.g., having not gone to school because of safety concerns, obesity, overweight, not eating vegetables, and not drinking milk). Monitoring emerging risk behaviors (e.g., texting and driving, bullying, and electronic vapor product use) is important to understand how they might vary over time. Public Health Action: YRBSS data are used widely to compare the prevalence of health behaviors among subpopulations of students; assess trends in health behaviors over time; monitor progress toward achieving 21 national health objectives for Healthy People 2020 and one of the 26 leading health indicators; provide comparable state and large urban school district data; and help develop and evaluate school and community policies, programs, and practices designed to decrease health-risk behaviors and improve health outcomes among youth.",pmid,27280474,Scopus,MMWR Surveillance Summaries,"Kann L., McManus T., Harris W.A., Shanklin S.L., Flint K.H., Hawkins J., Queen B., Lowry R., Olsen E.O., Chyen D., Whittle L., Thornton J., Lim C., Yamakawa Y., Brener N., Zaza S.",2016,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas

,A Peer-To-Peer Advertising Game,"Advertising plays a key role in service oriented recommendation over a peer-to-peer network. The advertising problem can be considered as the problem of finding a common language to denote the peers' capabilities and needs. Up to now the current approaches to the problem of advertising revealed that the proposed solutions either affect the autonomy assumption or do not scale up the size of the network. We explain how an approach based on language games can be effective in dealing with the typical issue of advertising: do not require ex-ante agreement and to be responsive to the evolution of the network as an open system. In the paper we introduce the notion of advertising game, a specific language game designed to deal with the issue of supporting the emergence of a common denotation language over a network of peers. We provide the related computational model and an experimental evaluation. A positive empirical evidence is achieved by sketching a peer-to-peer recommendation service for bookmark exchanging using real data. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.",eid,2-s2.0-35248841994,Scopus,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),"Avesani P., Agostini A.",2003,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas

,Cardiovascular Risk Factors And Health Behaviours In Elementary School-Age Inuvialuit And Gwich'in Children,"OBJECTIVES: To determine cardiovascular risk factors and health behaviours in Aboriginal children from the Beaufort-Delta region (Northwest Territories). METHODS: A total of 91 elementary school-age children underwent a cross-sectional assessment of body mass index, waist circumference, blood pressure and aerobic fitness. Healthy living knowledge and behaviours, including frequency of self-reported physical activity (PA) and dietary intake, were also evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 49.5% of children were obese/overweight and 31.9% had elevated blood pressure. The percentages having one, two or three cardiovascular risk factor(s) were 64.4%, 42.2% and 15.6%, respectively, with no significant difference between boys and girls. Overall, the students obtained higher mean scores in the areas of healthy PA, body image, self-esteem and nutritious beverage knowledge (89%, 85%, 79% and 71% of the maximum scores, respectively). The lowest scores were in nutritious food consumption and healthy PA frequency (46% and 56% of the maximum scores, respectively). On average, children consumed 2.7 L of sugar-sweetened beverages weekly and <2 servings of fruits or vegetables daily. Children spent approximately 2 h per day watching television, playing games or using a computer. CONCLUSION: There is an urgent need for community-based approaches to address the high rates of obesity and related cardiovascular risk factors among these Aboriginal children. Given the disconnect between healthy living knowledge and behaviour, it is important that future treatment programs address other barriers faced by Aboriginal populations living in rural and remote regions, including the high cost and limited access to high-quality nutritious foods and beverages, and limited access to indoor recreational programs over the long winter season. ©2014 Pulsus Group Inc.

,Changing Heartbeat Perception To Induce Anxiety In Virtual Environments,"In this paper, we first propose a general technique to induce anxiety in virtual environments (VEs) which exploits auditory heartbeat perception and biofeedback. Then, we consider a VE that reproduces a real-world anxietyinducing experience (being suddenly surrounded by smoke during a fire evacuation of a building), and we describe an experiment that contrasts 3 conditions: (i) an augmentation of the VE with a bar that indicates when the user’s avatar gets hurt, (ii) an augmentation of the VE with the typical audio visual stimuli which are employed in violent videogames when the user’s avatar gets hurt, (iii) introduction of the proposed biofeedback technique in the previous condition. We carry out an electrodermal analysis showing that the introduction of the proposed technique produces much higher physiological arousal in terms of skin conductance level (SCL) than the other two conditions. Subjective measures of users’ state anxiety are consistent with the recorded physiological reactions. © 2012 Interactive Media Institute.",eid,2-s2.0-85019569456,Scopus,Annual Review of CyberTherapy and Telemedicine,Chittaro L.,2012,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Co-Operative Strategy For An Interactive Robot Soccer System By Reinforcement Learning Method,"This paper presents a cooperation strategy between a human operator and autonomous robots for an interactive robot soccer game. The interactive robot soccer game has been developed to allow humans to join into the game dynamically and reinforce entertainment characteristics. In order to make these games more interesting, a cooperation strategy between humans and autonomous robots on a team is very important. Strategies can be pre-programmed or learned by robots themselves with learning or evolving algorithms. Since the robot soccer system is hard to model and its environment changes dynamically, it is very difficult to pre-program cooperation strategies between robot agents. Q-learning - one of the most representative reinforcement learning methods - is shown to be effective for solving problems dynamically without explicit knowledge of the system. Therefore, in our research, a Q-learning based learning method has been utilized. Prior to utilizing Q-learning, state variables describing the game situation and actions' sets of robots have been defined. After the learning process, the human operator could play the game more easily. To evaluate the usefulness of the proposed strategy, some simulations and games have been carried out.",eid,2-s2.0-4544289438,Scopus,"International Journal of Control, Automation and Systems","Kim H.-R., Hwang J.-H., Kwon D.-S.",2003,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Competitive Active Video Games: Physiological And Psychological Responses In Children And Adolescents,"BACKGROUND: Recent strategies to reduce sedentary behaviour in children include replacing sedentary screen time for active video games. Active video game studies have focused principally on the metabolic consumption of a single player, with physiological and psychological responses of opponent-based multiplayer games to be further evaluated. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether adding a competitive component to playing active video games impacts physiological and psychological responses in players. METHODS: Sixty-two healthy Caucasian children and adolescents, nine to 14 years years of age, completed three conditions (8 min each) in random order: treadmill walking, and single and opponent-based Kinect active video games. Affect, arousal, rate of perceived exertion, heart rate and percentage of heart rate reserve were measured for each participant and condition. RESULTS: Kinect conditions revealed significantly higher heart rate, percentage of heart rate reserve, rate of perceived exertion and arousal when compared with treadmill walking (P≤0.001). Opponent-based condition revealed lower values for the rate of perceived exertion (P=0.02) and higher affect (P=0.022) when compared with single play. CONCLUSION: Competitive active video games improved children's psychological responses (affect and rate of perceived exertion) compared with single play, providing a solution that may contribute toward improved adherence to physical activity. © 2015 Pulsus Group Inc.

,Contemporary Art Center Córdoba,"Architecture constantly nourishes itself with images hidden in our memory, ideas which become sharp and clear and unexpectedly mark the beginning of a project. Perhaps this is why the echo of the Hispano-lslamic culture, which is still latent in Cordoba, has subconsciously signified more than a footnote to our proposal. In the face of the homogeneity imposed by our global civilisation, in all aspects of life, the Centre of Contemporary Art aspires to interpret a very different western culture, going beyond the cliche of this expression so frequently used. Distrusting the supposed efficacy and flexibility of a neutral and universal container, nowadays commonly used, allows us to imagine a building closely linked to a place and to a distant memory, where every space is individually shaped, and to a time which can transform itself and expand in sequence with different dimensions, uses and spatial qualities. We have always been admirers of the hidden geometric laws through which those artists, artisans and master builders of a remote Islamic past were capable of creating, the multiple and isotropic spaces within the Mosque; a building facetted with vaults and muqarna windows, permutations of ornamental motifs with lattice windows, paving and ataurique decorations, or the rules and narrative rhythms implicit in the poems and tales of Islamic tradition. Like those literary structures which feature a story within a story, often within yet another- a story without an end -we conceived the project as beginning with a system, a law generated by a repeating geometric pattern, that would originate in a hexagonal shape, which then in turn contains three different types of rooms, of 150 m2, 90 m2, and 60 m2. Like a combinatorial game, the permutations of these three areas would generate sequences of different spaces that can possibly come to create a single exhibition area. The artists' workshops on the ground floor and the laboratories on the upper floor are located adjacent to the exhibition halls, to the point where there is no strict difference between them: artistic works can be exhibited in the workshops while the exhibition halls can also be used as areas for artistic production. The assembly room - the black box-is designed as a stage area suitable for theatrical productions, conferences, film screenings, or even for audiovisual exhibitions. The Centre of Contemporary Art is not a centralised organism: its centre moves from one area to another, it is everywhere. It is designed as a sequence of rooms linked to a public walkway, where the different functions of the building come together. Conceived as a crossroads and meeting place, it is a communal area for exhibitions and exchange of ideas, to view an installation, see exhibitions, visit the cafe, use the mediateque, wait for the start of a show in the black box, or perhaps gaze at the Guadalquivir river. The materials coalesce to suggest the character of an art factory, which pervades the entire project. Throughout the interior, walls and slabs of concrete and continuous concrete floors establish a spatial area capable of being transformed at individual points using different forms of intervention. A network of electrical, digital, audio and lighting infrastructures creates the possibility of multiple views and connections everywhere. Outside, the building aspires to express itself through one material: GRC prefabricated panels that at the same time clad the opaque and perforated facades, or make up the flat and sloping roofs of the halls. The industrialised concept of the system as well as the conditions of impermeability, insulation and lightness of the material, contribute to guarantee the precision and rationality of its execution but also play a part in the interconnected concept that governs the whole project. The facade that faces onto the river, a true mask that protagonizes the exterior facade of the building, is conceived as a screen perforated by several polygonal openings with LED-type monochromatic maps behind them. With an appropriate computer programme, video signals will generate images and texts that will be reflected on the river's surface and enable installations specifically conceived for the place. During the day, natural light will filter through the perforations and penetrate the interior covered walkway. In the Centre for Contemporary Art, artists, visitors, experts, researchers and the public, will meet as in a contemporary zouk, without an obvious spatial hierarchy. It will be a centre for creative artistic processes that will closely link the architectural space with the public: an open laboratory where architecture attempts to provoke new modes of expression. Some of the most recent artistic proposals linked to the most recent technologies appear to move away from materiality and submerge themselves in a virtuality disconnected from a concrete place, but perhaps through it, disagreeing with this interpretation - which has become a commonplace - we are convinced that the building itself, the Guadalquivir river, the present and the past of Cordoba, will not simply be a casual circumstance but, as it has been for us as well, will be the start of a dialogue, agreement, or perhaps rejection. For are these not also emotions that underlie the search for all artistic expression?.",eid,2-s2.0-84876875512,Scopus,Space,Sobejano N.,2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Crowd-Sourcing Real-World Human-Robot Dialogue And Teamwork Through Online Multiplayer Games,"We present an innovative approach for largescale data collection in human-robot interaction research through the use of online multiplayer games. By casting a robotic task as a collaborative game, we gather thousands of examples of human-human interactions online, and then leverage this corpus of action and dialogue data to create contextually relevant social and task-oriented behaviors for human-robot interaction in the real world. We demonstrate our work in a collaborative search and retrieval task requiring dialogue, action synchronization, and action sequencing between the human and robot partners. A user study performed at the Boston Museum of Science shows that the autonomous robot exhibits many of the same patterns of behavior that were observed in the online data set and survey results rate the robot similarly to human partners in several critical measures.

,Design Considerations For Large Roof-Integrated Photovoltaic Arrays,"This paper describes calculations and modeling used in the design of the photovoltaic (PV) array built on the roof of the Georgia Tech Aquatic Center, the aquatic sports venue for the 1996 Olympic and Paralympic Games. The software package PVFORM (version 33) was extensively utilized; because of its importance to this work, it is thoroughly reviewed here. Procedures required to adapt PVFORM to this particular installation are described. The expected behavior and performance of the system, including maximum power output, annual energy output and maximum expected temperature, are then presented, and the use of this information in making informed design decisions is described. Finally, since the orientation of the PV array is not optimal, the effect of the unoptimized array orientation on the system's performance is quantified. © 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",eid,2-s2.0-0030704489,Scopus,Progress in Photovoltaics: Research and Applications,"Ropp M.E., Begovic M., Rohatgi A., Long R.",1997,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Energy Expenditure During Non-Traditional Physical Activities,"The purpose of this study was to compare the physical demands of a climbing activity (Prusik climbing) to Nintendo Wii boxing and brisk walking. Twenty-four college students (24 ± 4 years; 175.4 ± 8.6 cm; 78.9 ± 17.4 kg) attended four separate laboratory sessions: (a) 30 min of brisk walking; (b) maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max) test; (c) 30 min of Nintendo Wii boxing; and (d) 30 min of Prusik climbing. During the walking, boxing, and Prusik climbing, heart rate (HR), rating of perceived exertion (RPE), oxygen consumption (VO2) and respiratory exchange ratio (RER) were recorded, from which average METs, total and average energy expenditure (TEE30 and Aver-EE1.0), and percentage of VO2 reserve (%VO2R) were determined. Prusik climbing generated significantly higher average VO2, %VO2R, HR, RPE, METs, TEE30, and Aver-EE1.0 compared to brisk walking and Wii boxing (P&lt;0.05). Prusik climbing may provide an appealing alternative to traditional exercise programs for meeting current physical activity recommendations.",eid,2-s2.0-79960814827,Scopus,Journal of Exercise Physiology Online,"Sell K., Clocksin B.D., Spierer D., Ghigiarelli J.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Exploring Interrelationships Among High School Students’ Engagement Factors In Introductory Programming Courses Via A 3D Multi-User Serious Game Created In Open Sim,"The technological affordances of three-dimensional (3D) multi-user virtual worlds and their effectiveness in task-based learning approaches are to a large extent well-established in the international field of computer literacy research. However, less attention was given to their positive or negative impact on student engagement. The current study seeks to investigate the interrelationships of students’ engagement among multidimensional constructs consisting of cognitive, emotional and behavioral factors in order to understand better the educational community the learning effectiveness emerged through a 3D computer-supported and multiuser serious game created for introductory programming courses. An instructional design framework based on Papert’s theory of Constructionism to be amplified the students’ activities and management of their interactions in a 3D multi-user serious game created via an Open Sim standalone server integrated with Scratch4OS is also proposed. Fifty-five (n=55) voluntary students from three different high schools participated and experienced in a 3D mind-trap puzzle game named Co.Co.I.A. (Collaborative Construction of Interactive Artifacts) to learn basic programming structures. The empirical study findings indicated that student behavioral engagement (attention, retention and energy expenditure for activity completion) had not only a linear correlation with cognitive engagement (learning strategies for the construction of the knowledge domain), but it had also a positive association with emotional engagement (students’ positive emotions and achievement orientation) in collaborative learning tasks, causing the reinforcement of the other two factors as well. © J.UCS.",eid,2-s2.0-84920050637,Scopus,Journal of Universal Computer Science,Pellas N.,2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Game-Paddle Control Linearity Test.,"It is possible to use the game-paddle inputs on the Apple II to measure physical properties like resistance, capacitance, temperature, and light intensity. There are two important considerations in such measurements. The first is whether the output of the game-paddle instruction, y equals PDL(x), varies linearly with the physical property. Equally important is the scale factor - the ratio of y to the value of the physical property corresponding to y. A program listing is presented to test the linearity of the game-paddle input and obtains the scale factor. The program contains two simple loops. The inside loop reads the game-paddle port, prints the output on the screen of the video monitor, and tests the keyboard of the Apple II for a keystroke. When a keystroke occurs, the program requests the input of a physical quantity. It is shown how to measure resistance using the Apple II microcomputer.",eid,2-s2.0-0022147398,Scopus,Byte,De Jong Marvin L.,1985,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Game@School: Teaching Stem Through Mobile Apps And Role-Based Games,"Dealing with digital native students requires new methodologies of teaching. In this work, we describe an approach and a conceptual architecture of a supporting teaching tool that takes into account two main objectives in new teaching trends: Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs) and Intelligent Pedagogical Agents (IPAs). The main idea is a VLE that in turn is a role playing game. The game structure follows a quest-based game that is deliberately designed as a system of problem-solving activities aimed at achieving objectives, to be successfully addressed in order to progress and eventually win. The emotional behavior of the IPAs has been built by conducting a study on emotions with high school students.

,How Video Games May Enhance Students' Learning And Cognitive Development,"Despite the fact that video games have a reputation ""as mindless pursuits used strictly for entertainment"" (Rice, 2005), numerous researchers believe that playing them may have positive impacts on students' learning (e.g., Aldrich, 2004; Elliot, Adams, & Bruckman, 2002; Gee, 2003, 2006; Mohamed & Jaafar, 2010) and cognitive development (Green & Bavelier, 2006; Sherry, 2006). Consequently, the potential value that video games have on students' overall well being deserves special attention. This paper explores what makes a video game so appealing to players, along with what one can learn by playing video games prior to proposing them as excellent complementary tools for instruction. Specifically, this paper focuses on: 1) how video games may enhance students' learning when incorporated in educational settings; 2) how playing video games may have a positive effect on students' cognitive development; and 3) the implications of designing and implementing educational video games within the school.

,Lifeisgame Prototype: A Serious Game About Emotions For Children With Autism Spectrum Disorders,"This paper presents the LIFEisGAME prototype-Ipad version - a serious game that proposes to enhance facial and emotional recognition skills in children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). We assess the prototype game regarding motivation to play and game usability, and also participants' emotional recognition abilities and technology usage. People with autism are less likely to gaze at faces and are also impaired in face discrimination tasks. Recently, technology plays an active role in helping these individuals to understand emotions and recognise facial expressions. LIFEisGAME prototype was played during a 15 minute game session by 11 children with ASD, with ages varying from 5-15 years old (M=9.27, SD=2.97), 91% were male and 9% were female, 82% were verbal ASD and 18% were non-verbal ASD. We video recorded each child and the footage was analysed according to game usability and motivation to play. Parents (n=11) filled out a parental consent form and a questionnaire about their child's technology usage and their emotional understanding. Therapists' opinions (n=8) about the game were given during an unstructured interview. The game was presented on an Ipad 4 (9.7 inches, 2048×1536). Participants enjoyed the prototype but it still needs to be simplified. All participants had experience with computer games. Fear, disgust and surprise were the most challenging emotions to recognise. Parents suggested adding musical stimuli to promote motivation and therapists recommended to include visual game instructions.

,Machine Implementation Of Human-Like Intuition,"In everyday life, people tend to make quick decisions based on intuition. We propose that intuition may be implemented by mapping the current situation to some previous experiences with the same attribute, and ranking the experiences according to recentness and emotion. Two examples are provided: the intuition process may decide to flip a coin for guessing which team would win a soccer game, or to check only women wearing blue dress for finding someone in a crowded train station. Surprisingly, these ""irrational"" decisions from intuition process may actually be more efficient in solving problems, while logical process suffers from slowness and the problem of data reliability. For a computer, the intuition process is a new way of solving problems, and will become a new methodology in intelligent systems. © 2013 ICIC International.",eid,2-s2.0-84877746057,Scopus,ICIC Express Letters,"Chik D., Dundas J.",2013,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Media Effects On Antisocial Behavior In Children And Adolescents,"There is mounting evidence on the effects of media on antisocial and aggressive behaviour. This chapter reviews current research on the topic, which has focused on how media violence effects on arousal, affect, cognition and behaviour. Most evidence comes from television and video games research and the differential effects of these two types of media on the individual are examined. Additional evidence from studies on the Internet effects and music and lyrics is also provided. The main short and long-term effects of media violence are also discussed, suggesting different explanatory models. Another important distinction examined relates to the types of violence displayed on the media. Most of the effects of media violence relate to the development, over-learning and reinforcement of aggression-related knowledge structures, including hostile attribution bias, aggressive actions against others, expectations of violence, positive attitudes towards violence, the belief that violence is acceptable and appropriate to solve problems, and desensitization. Although aggressive and antisocial behavior is affected by media violence, there is also evidence that a raw amount of media use, regardless of its violent content, has an impact on behavior. The social perspective of the individual mediates the relation between raw media use and behavior. This is explained in terms of the lack of role-taking opportunities that media provide, compared to other sources of socialization. The inability to adopt another's perspective and the lack of opportunities for cognitive de-centering and the reduction of egocentric bias limit the adolescent's capacity to calculate the consequences of own behavior. It also limits his/her understanding of the needs, feelings, desires, purposes, and worries of other people. Individuals in this situation would be unable to grasp the most direct consequences of their behavior and, consequently, would be more likely to engage in antisocial conducts. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

,Mobile Robots And Interdisciplinary Design - Mobots,"An engineering curriculum challenge is to create an environment in which engineering problems can be solved using different strategies or variations to a common approach and that has a team component. This paper discusses the construction of Mobile Robots (MOBOTS) in the Electronic and Electrical Engineering undergraduate robotics laboratory of California State University, Sacramento that contains interdisciplinary engineering design. The course is open to all engineering and computer science students with a sufficient background. The MOBOT is composed of a based mobile platform (Brawn) driven by two motors on which is mounted an embedded microprocessor' board with various sensors (Brain). Interactive C (IC), developed at the MIT Media Lab, is used to program the MOBOT for autonomous operation and non-autonomous tests. During the lab periods, MOBOT teams are formed to construct the MOBOTs with the major objective of competing in the MOBOT Olympic Games at the end of the semester.",eid,2-s2.0-33847592108,Scopus,Computers in Education Journal,Heller M.D.,2e3,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,New Uses For Wearable Textile-Based Health Monitoring Technology,"Wearable health monitoring systems employ sensors to read vital signs from the human body - such as the heart rate, body temperature and blood pressure. Textile-based sensors can be woven or knitted into an item of clothing and wom next to the skin. Information picked up can be sent to an electronic device where it can be recorded or displayed and used to provide the wearer with bio-feedback. Wearable health monitoring systems were originally developed to monitor the health of astronauts, and then transmit information to control stations on earth. More recently, they have been used in the medical sector to monitor patients, including those recovering from operations away from hospital. One company at the foreftont of wearable health monitoring is USA-based Textronics. The company has four product families: Textro-Sensors or conductive fabric electrodes and motion sensors; Textro Interconnect laminate wiring cable; Textro Yarn elastic conductive fibre; and Textro Polymer variable resistive polymer. Its first product was the NuMetrex branded sports bra Since then it has added the NuMetrex Cardio Shirt for men and the NuMetrex Racer Tank for women. More recently, it has launched Heart Smart apparel to enable it to expand from the sports to the health market. Target customers will include those focusing on weight loss and hearl health. It has also launched a developer's kit containing all the parts needed to make a wearable health monitoring system. The kit includes textile sensors - approved by the USA-based Food and Drug Administration (FDA) - as an alternative to the adhesive electrodes and metal wristbands commonly used with electrocardiograph (ECG) instruments. Forecasts from Venture Development Corporation (VDC) suggest that sales of smart fabrics and interactive textiles (SFIT) for sensing and monitoring will grow by 49.3% a year between 2006 and 2010. NPD Group has predicted that interactive apparel is likely to become a billion dollar business before long. Promising applications include fitness, corporate wellness, lifestyle health, medical health care, facilitation of independent living by the elderly, military uses and sports. Futuristic ideas include clothing which is capable of reading a person's emotional state for use in computer games. Another concept is that of ""tele health"", whereby patients would be diagnosed and treated without having to visit a doctor. Overall, the outlook for wearable textile-based health monitoring systems is positive. But to gain mass acceptance by consumers, devices need to be comfortable, easy to carefor, reliable, easy to use, and inexpensive. © Textiles Intelligence Limited 2008.",eid,2-s2.0-53249117575,Scopus,Textile Outlook International,[No author name available],2008,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,On Chatbots And Avatars - The Virtual Forester As A Guide To Knowledge About Sustainable Forest Management,"A chatbot (the term is a combination of 'chat' and 'robot') is an engine that answers questions asked via an electronic medium such as the Internet in natural language. A chatbot is personalized by an avatar, a virtual animated character, and is able to use emotion as a way to transport information. A chatbot can be used to navigate through complex websites, to interact with users by answering questions, to link to large databases and to guide to a desired source of knowledge. With a chatbot, different media such as flash-animation, audio and video can be integrated on a website. This chapter presents a chatbot representing a virtual forester. It is used as a guide through a website that contains knowledge issued from a large research programme in five project regions of Germany dealing with sustainable forest management, especially forest transformation. Target groups of this website range from the general public, secondary school students (aged 13-14 years) to scientists and the press. The design and structure of the website, including virtual excursions on three different knowledge levels, a forest game for students and a scientific database, as well as teaching material for secondary schools, are outlined. The abilities of the chatbot and the usability of the website are demonstrated. Further objectives of the research, which aim at linking the chatbot to a content-management system and to an information marketplace where forest experts give advice in order to create a comprehensive knowledge management system, are presented. © CAB International 2007.",eid,2-s2.0-84891028728,Scopus,Sustainable Forestry: From Monitoring and Modelling to Knowledge Management and Policy Science,"Reinbolz A., Hanewinkel M.",2007,Book Chapter,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Optimal Guidance Of A Relay Aircraft To Extend Small Unmanned Aircraft Range,"This paper developed guidance laws to optimally and autonomously position a relay Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) to provide an operator with real-time Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) by relaying communication and video signals from a rover MAV to the base, thus extending the rover's reach. The ISR system is comprised of two MAVs, the Relay and the Rover, and a Base. The Relay strives to position itself so as to minimize the radio frequency (RF) power required for maintaining communications between the Rover and the Base, while the Rover performs the ISR mission, which may maximize the required RF power. The optimal control of the Relay MAV then entails the solution of a differential game. Applying Pontryagin's Maximum Principle yields a standard, albeit nonlinear, Two-Point Boundary Value Problem (TPBVP). Suboptimal solutions are first obtained as an aid in solving the TPBVP which yields the solution of the differential game. One suboptimal approach is based upon the geometry of the ISR system: The midpoint between the Rover and the Base is the ideal location which minimizes the RF power required, so the Relay heads toward that point-assuming that the Rover is stationary. At the same time, to maximize the rate of required RF power, the Rover moves in the opposite direction of the Relay-assuming the Relay is stationary. These are optimal strategies in the end-game, but it is suboptimal to use them throughout the game. Another suboptimal approach investigated envisions the Rover to remain stationary and solves for the optimal path for the Relay to minimize the RF power requirement. This one-sided optimization problem is analyzed using a Matlab-based optimization program, GPOCS, which uses the Gauss pseudospectral method of discretization. The results from GPOCS corroborated with the geometry-based suboptimal Relay strategy of heading straight toward the midpoint between the Rover and the Base. The suboptimal solutions are readily implementable for real-time operation and are used to facilitate the solutions of the TPBVP.",eid,2-s2.0-84985963210,Scopus,International Journal of Micro Air Vehicles,"Pachter M., Hansen J., Jacques D., Blue P.",2010,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Plain To See An Example Of Popular Theology In Decision-Making Gaming (L.a. Noire),"The video game L.A. Noire (Rockstar Games, 2011) replaces a theocentric worldview with anthropomorphically amended versions of spiritual life. For instance, the attribution of human values and even of a body to obviously impersonal existence is conspicuous. In the unfolding of the plot, moral conduct and notions of duty are commonly thought to stand for a mostly unseen and silent God. He is treated accordingly, i.e., as having both extrinsic and intrinsic representations in public fictions. Even more, a popular (mis)construal of Theology is part of the aesthetic tradition that games are bound to fall into. The fictionalizing of the daily life in the gaming industry essentially relies on sensational incidents and violent appeals to emotions. The cultural discourse of game-playing brings together the visual and the sonic set-up of godly absence/presence plain to see in the familiar re-enactment of the social intercourse and in the re-construction of a mostly urban landscape. Basically, the computer generated interface is immersive insofar as it features ethically-minded versus morally-corrupt characters. The video games aesthetics showcases a version of the Western pop culture that fits the obviously monotheist mould of our European past. What drives the usually minimal plot of mainstream digital storytelling is the compulsive belief in one legitimizing truth. The underlying cultural narrative is that of one hero, who embodies statistics about biography and sets out to enforce his authority over the world. The search for existential answers to questions of life purpose is limited to the presuppositions of the Western civilisation. The conclusion is that a melodramatic paradigm structures the ethical and societal issues touched upon by current mainstream video games. © 2015, European Journal of Science and Theology.

,Prominent Deck B Phenomenon: Are Decision-Makers Sensitive To Long-Term Outcome In The Iowa Gambling Task?,"Background: Damasio and Bechara et al. suggested somatic marker hypothesis (SMH) that under uncertainty, the intact emotion system can facilitate the rationaldecision in the long run. Most healthy decision-makers have the foresighted choicepattern. Namely, healthy subjects prefer advantageous decks to disadvantageous decks after the second block (about trials 21-40) in the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) (Damasio,1994; Bechara et al., 1999). Conversely, the patients with ventromedial prefrontal lesions possess the myopic decision pattern. However, an increasing number of studies have identified the prominent deck B (PDB) phenomenon, indicating that normal decision-makers have myopic choice behavior in the IGT. Normal subjects have difficulty avoiding disadvantageous deck B, even when near game end. Nevertheless, most IGT-related studies, including those of the Iowa group, subtracted bad decks from good decks (the two-category format) when presenting experimental data. Consequently, the incidence of the PDB phenomenon was not accurately assessed. Here we provided an empirical study which contains a complex and simple version of IGT to illustrate the PDB phenomenon. Methods: Two computer versions of IGT (concurrent (cIGT) vs. net-value (nIGT) are utilized to determine whether healthy decision-makers start shifting their preference from bad decks to good decks after the second block (about trials 21-40). In total, 48 gender-balanced subjects participated in this experiment. Each subject played only thecIGT or the nIGT. In total, 300 trials for each IGT version were utilized to identify the extended preferences of subjects. Results: A few studies presented data acquired using the four-deck format, providing clear experimental results for each deck that verify that the PDB phenomenon exists. Additionally, empirical results obtained by this study indicate that the two-category format identified a turning point for preferences during the second block (about trials 21-40) in both IGT versions. However, the PDB phenomenon existed in most stages of both IGT versions; namely, most healthy decision-makers avoided bad deck A, and had difficultly avoiding bad deck B. Conclusions: The present research indicates that the PDB phenomenon probably exists in most IGT related studies. Different presentation methods (two categories vs. four decks) can result in entirely different explanations of IGT decision behavior. Empiricaldata demonstrate that in both IGT versions, the PDB phenomenon existed, (Lin et al., 2007), which is counter to the basic IGT assumption that decks are chosen based on long-term outcome, even under an extended number of trials. This empirical finding indicates that players have a myopic view of long-term outcome in the IGT. © 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

,Self-Localization Based On Monocular Vision For Humanoid Robot,"Robot soccer game is one of the significant and interesting areas among most of the autonomous robotic researches. Following the humanoid soccer robot basic movement and strategy actions, the robot is operated in a dynamic and unpredictable contest environment and must recognize the position of itself in the field all the time. Therefore, the localization system of the soccer robot becomes the key technology to improve the performance. This work proposes efficient approaches for humanoid robot and uses one landmark to accomplish the self-localization. This localization mechanism integrates the information from the pan/tilt motors and a single camera on the robot head together with the artificial neural network technique to adaptively adjust the humanoid robot position. The neural network approach can improve the precision of the localization. The experimental results indicate that the average accuracy ratio is 88.5% under frame rate of 15 frames per second (fps), and the average error for the distance between the actual position and the measured position of the object is 6.68 cm.",eid,2-s2.0-84863030906,Scopus,Tamkang Journal of Science and Engineering,"Chang S.-H., Hsia C.-H., Chang W.-H., Chiang J.-S.",2011,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Sequentially Dependent Meta-Constraint Satisfaction Problem: An Application To Video Games,"A Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) consists in a sequence of variables holding a domain of possible values and relations among these variables called constraints. A meta-CSP can be seen as a metaproblem whose decomposition leads to a set of CSPs. The meta-variables correspond to sub-problems of the original problem, and a meta-constraint is a relation among those meta-variables. Meta-CSPs find many applications in industry, usually in processes that involve time and actions such as the control of a robot, a manufacturing process, or the scheduling of any common activity. In this paper, we introduce the notion of Sequentially Dependent Meta-CSP (SD Meta-CSP), which extends the meta-CSP in order to support applications where a dependency between sub-problems is mandatory. In this case, the meta-CSP is decomposed into a set of sub-problems {Pi, Pi+1, . . . , Pn}, but the instance of the sub-problem Pi+1 sequentially depends on the solution of the sub-problem Pi . In this work we provide a formal definition for the SD Meta-CSPs, a framework to handle it, and we illustrate its applicability to video games. In particular, we model and implement agents as SD Meta-CSPs able to autonomously play two classic games: Ms. Pac-Man and Super Mario Bros.",eid,2-s2.0-84923933033,Scopus,Romanian Journal of Information Science and Technology,"Soto R., Crawford B., Monfroy E., Paredes F.",2014,Article,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Treatment Efficiency Of Heat-Sensitive Moxibustion Affiliation In Children With Unilateral Hyperopic Anisometropic Amblyopia,"Objective: This study aims to investigate the efficacy of Heat-sensitive moxibustion affiliation treatment for unilateral hyperopic anisometropic amblyopia. Methods: 92 children (aged from 8 a to 14 a) diagnosed as unilateral hyperopic anisometropic amblyopia in the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University from 2007 to 2013 were include in this prospective random controlled study. All patients were divided into three groups and treated with different therapeutic method: occlusion (group A), combination of occlusion and video game (group B), and combination of occlusion, video game and heat-sensitive moxibustion (group C). After 60 days treatment, all cases were received therapy with red light flicker, luster, light brush for 120 days at home. All treatments were finished until 180 days later. In addition, visual acuity assay and visual evoked potentials (VEP) were used in all case at pre-therapy and 20 d, 40 d, 60 d, 180 d of post-therapy during the period of treatment. Results: There were no significant differences in age, course and visual acuity in three groups (F=1.88, 0.82, 0.38; P>0.05). After 60 days treatment, the visual acuity of all case in three groups were increased. The BCVA (The best-corrected visual acuity) of patients in group B and group C were higher than that of patients in group A at every time point (P<0.05). After 180 days treatment, BCVA was improved from baseline by an average of 1.07 lines in the group A, 2.83 lines in the group B and 5.86 lines in the group C. Comparing with the latency of P100 of VEP elicited by reversing checkerboard with different spatial frequencies in case before treatment, the latency of P100 of VEP were shortened significantly in three groups at 180 d. Besides, the latency of P100 of VEP elicited in group C were less shorter than other case in group A and B [4 period/radian, t=11.62, P<0.05; 8 period/radian, t=9.68, P<0.05].

,A Study Of Trust Development In Virtual Human-Agent Teamwork Without Explicit Coordination,"With the advancement in agent technology and social recognition and acceptance of autonomous online services we foresee increasing use of agents in social contexts and, in particular, in human-agent virtual and ad hoc team applications. For such virtual ad hoc teams, particularly those where explicit coordination to determine task allocations are infeasible due to communication and time constraints,  to be effective, agents need to quickly develop an understanding of the expectation of human team members and be able to quickly adapt accordingly. This dissertation  empirically investigates the effects of agent performance, past experience of humans, and agent reputation on human trust in and behavior towards agent teammates. We also study the differences in growth of humans' trust attitudes towards human and agent teammates during initial interactions while achieving team goals.    Ad hoc collaboration of humans and agents without pre-planning is a novel human-agent teamwork concept that enables diverse, high-impact applications including emergency response, group buying, online social movements, and next generation crowd-sourcing. In spite of prior work on the influence of various factors on human trust in automation, very little is known about human trust in ""peer"" agent teammates. This is the first study to investigate these factors in virtual human-agent teamwork without pre-planning or explicit coordination.    This dissertation introduces a repeated team coordination game, the Game of Trust (GoT), in which two players repeatedly cooperate to complete team tasks without prior assignment of subtasks. We systematically evaluate the effects of agent performance, past experience, and agent reputation on human trust in the GoT by performing an extensive set of controlled experiments with subjects recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk, a crowdsourcing Internet marketplace. We collect both teamwork performance data as well as surveys to gauge participants' trust in their agent partners. A learning agent player is developed by training on collected game data to predict future task choices of humans and is shown to increase social utility by reducing redundant work and increasing team goal achievement rates.    The empirical results indicate that participants were able to respond appropriately to changes in an agent's behavior in terms of trust and contributions to teamwork, that positive (negative) past experience and positive (negative) reputation increase (decrease) human trust in agent teammates, and humans' trust attitudes towards human and agent teammates differ. The results also show that past experience can affect three antecedents of trust: emotional state, game expertise, and expectation. The interplay between these three elements significantly affected the influence of agent performance and reputation on human trust. The detailed findings and the recommendations derived from them in this dissertation will allow agent developers to set appropriate context for more efficient and successful ad hoc collaboration between human and agent peers in virtual teams.    This dissertation enhances our understanding of the changes in human trust in peer level agent teammates with respect to agent trustworthiness, past experience, and agent reputation. The empirical findings provide clear and significant evidence of the influence of key factors on human trust in virtual agent teammates. We also derive several guidelines for agents to follow in practice.",pq_id,1807632181,proquest_dt,NA,"Hafizoglu, Feyza Merve",2015,THES,Ph.D.,reviewer2,Andreas
,Data-Driven Interaction Methods For Socially Assistive Robotics: Validation With Children With Autism Spectrum Disorders,"There exists a great untapped potential for the use of intelligent robots as therapeutic social partners for children. However, enabling a robot to understand social behavior, and do so while interacting with the child, is a challenging problem. Children are highly individual and thus technology used for social interaction requires recognition of a wide-range of social behavior. This argues for data-driven methods that capture the relevant range of interactions. This work addresses the challenge of designing data-driven behaviors for socially assistive robots in order to enable them to recognize and appropriately respond to a child's free-form behavior in unstructured play contexts. The focus on free-form behavior is inspired by and grounded in the DIR/Floortime approach to therapeutic intervention with children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). This approach emphasizes fostering engagement through play, recognizing social behavior and using ""engagements"" to bolster social interactions.    This research presents a data-driven methodology and a validated experimental framework for enabling fully autonomous robots to interact with both typically developing children and children with ASD in undirected scenarios using socially appropriate behavior, especially where spatial interaction is concerned. Autonomous robot operation as a critical aspect of the methodology; save for safety interventions by a human operator, the robot acts of its own accord. The robot and child engage in free-form interaction, in part though distance-oriented behaviors; the robot must be able to recognize the child's behaviors and respond to them appropriately. This dissertation presents the following computational contributions with therapeutic potential:    • Detection and mitigation of a child's distress: This work presents methodology for learning and then applying a data-driven spatio-temporal model of social behavior based on distance-based features to automatically differentiate between typical vs. aversive child-robot interactions. Using a Gaussian Mixture Model learned over distance-based feature data, the developed system is able to detect and interpret social behavior with sufficient accuracy to recognize child distress. The robot uses this model to change its own behavior so as to encourage positive social interaction.    • Encouragement of human-human and human-robot interaction: This work demonstrates a global and local motion planner that uses the above spatio-temporal model as part of the determination of a motion trajectory that maintains the robot's spatial relationship with the child and sustains interaction while also encouraging the child to move toward another proximal interaction partner. The desired spatial interaction behavior is achieved by modifying an established trajectory planner to weight candidate trajectories based on conformity to a trained model of the desired behavior.    • Data-Driven Approach For Providing Graded Cueing Feedback: A methodology for robot behavior that provides autonomous feedback for a robot-child imitation and turn-taking game. This is accomplished by incorporating an established therapeutic model of feedback along with a trained model of imitation behavior. This is used as part of an autonomous system that can play a turn-taking game, recognize breeches in imitation behavior, and interpret a breech in order to provide appropriate feedback. The approach is validated in a spatial imitation game, used to gauge the presence of imitation behavior.    The three main contributions above: averse behavior detection, model-based trajectory planning, and data-driven feedback, have been instantiated and validated in several SAR systems using autonomous person sensing, behavior interpretation, and action selection, for the purposes of detecting, provoking, and encouraging both human-human and human-robot social interaction. The validated systems were tested in experiments that evaluated the system design, the accuracy of the robot's ability to interpret observed behavior, the appropriateness of the robot's responses, and the quality of the child-robot and child-parent social behavior interaction. The evaluation experiments were conducted with both children with ASD and typically developing children. The systems were also used to explore the therapeutic potential of socially assistive robots facilitated by the developed models, architecture, and experiment framework.",pq_id,1027773421,proquest_dt,NA,"Feil-Seifer, David J.",2012,THES,Ph.D.,reviewer2,Andreas
,Distributed Constrained Bayesian Optimization: Autonomous Camera Control,"This dissertation describes methods to autonomously control an  intelligent camera network with changeable pan, tilt, and zoom (PTZ) parameters for the purpose of obtaining high resolution facial imagery of randomly maneuvering targets. Every camera is treated as a self interested decision making agent that works in cooperation with the other agents in the network to attain a predefined system goal. The per camera per target image quality is designed and defined mathematically to formulate a distributed constrained optimization problem. Each camera is restricted to alter its own PTZ settings. All cameras use information broadcasted by neighboring cameras such that the PTZ parameters of every camera are optimized relative to the global objective. At certain times of opportunity, due to the configuration of the targets relative to the cameras, and the fact that each camera may track many targets, the camera network may be able to reconfigure itself to achieve a required target tracking specification for each target with remaining degrees-of-freedom. The remaining degrees-of-freedom can be used to obtain high resolution facial images from desirable viewing angles for certain targets. The challenge is to design algorithms that autonomously find these time instants, the appropriate imaging camera, and the appropriate parameter settings for all cameras to capitalize on these opportunities. The methodologies and solutions proposed herein involve a Bayesian formulation. The Bayesian formulation automatically trades off objective maximization versus the risk of losing target tracking performance. The dissertation describes a mathematical formulation of the visual sensing problem, design of functions that provide a measure of system performance, development of distributed methodologies that allows cameras to exchange information and asymptotically converge on optimal solutions, and incorporation of planning into the PTZ optimization methodology. The work herein presents theoretical solutions and analyses of results obtained on a simulated network of smart PTZ cameras.",pq_id,1500827076,proquest_dt,NA,"Morye, Akshay Ajit",2013,THES,Ph.D.,reviewer2,Andreas
,Interactive Learning For Sequential Decisions And Predictions,"Sequential prediction problems arise commonly in many areas of robotics and information processing: e.g., predicting a sequence of actions over time to achieve a goal in a control task, interpreting an image through a sequence of local image patch classifications, or translating speech to text through an iterative decoding procedure.    Learning predictors that can reliably perform such sequential tasks is challenging. Specifically, as predictions influence future inputs in the sequence, the data-generation process and executed predictor are inextricably intertwined. This can often lead to a significant mismatch between the distribution of examples observed during training (induced by the predictor used to generate training instances) and test executions (induced by the learned predictor). As a result, naively applying standard supervised learning methods—that assume independently and identically distributed training and test examples—often leads to poor test performance and compounding errors: inaccurate predictions lead to untrained situations where more errors are inevitable.    This thesis proposes general iterative learning procedures that leverage interactions between the learner and teacher to provably learn good predictors for sequential prediction tasks. Through repeated interactions, our approaches can efficiently learn predictors that are robust to their own errors and predict accurately during test executions. Our main approach uses existing no-regret online learning methods to provide strong generalization guarantees on test performance.    We demonstrate how to apply our main approach in various sequential prediction settings: imitation learning, model-free reinforcement learning, system identification, structured prediction and submodular list predictions. Its efficiency and wide applicability are exhibited over a large variety of challenging learning tasks, ranging from learning video game playing agents from human players and accurate dynamic models of a simulated helicopter for controller synthesis, to learning predictors for scene understanding in computer vision, news recommendation and document summarization. We also demonstrate the applicability of our technique on a real robot, using pilot demonstrations to train an autonomous quadrotor to avoid trees seen through its onboard camera (monocular vision) when flying at low-altitude in natural forest environments.    Our results throughout show that unlike typical supervised learning tasks where examples of good behavior are sufficient to learn good predictors, interaction is a fundamental part of learning in sequential tasks. We show formally that some level of interaction is necessary, as without interaction, no learning algorithm can guarantee good performance in general.",pq_id,1461396137,proquest_dt,NA,"Ross, Stephane",2013,THES,Ph.D.,reviewer2,Andreas
,Modeling Behavior And Variation For Crowd Animation,"The simulation of crowds of virtual characters is needed for applications such as films, games, and virtual reality environments. These simulations are difficult due to the large number of characters to be simulated and the requirement for synthesizing realistic human-like motion efficiently. This thesis focuses on two problems: how to search through and select motion clips of behaviors so that human-like motion can be generated for multiple characters interactively, and how to model and synthesize variation in motion data.    Given a collection of blendable segmented motion clips derived from motion capture or keyframed animation, this thesis explores novel ways to apply heuristic search algorithms to generate goal-driven navigation motion for virtual humanlike characters. Motion clips are organized and interconnected through a behavior graph that encodes the possible actions of a character. A planning approach is used to search over these possible actions to efficiently generate motion. This technique works well for synthesizing animations of multiple characters navigating autonomously in large dynamic environments.    In addition, this thesis introduces a novel planning approach based on precomputation that is more efficient than traditional forward search methods. We present a technique for precomputing large and diverse trees, and describe a backward search method used during runtime to solve planning queries. This new approach allows us to develop an interactive animation system that supports a large number of characters simultaneously.    Finally, this thesis addresses the issue of motion variation. Current state-of-the-art crowd simulations often use a few specific motion clips or repeated cycles of a particular motion to continuously animate multiple characters. The idea of synthesizing the subtle variations in motion data has been largely unexplored, as previous work considers variation to be an additive noise component. This thesis instead uses a data-driven approach and applies learning techniques to this problem. Given a small number of input motions, we model the data with a Dynamic Bayesian Network, and synthesize new spatial and temporal variants that are statistically similar to the inputs.",pq_id,304864473,proquest_dt,NA,"Lau, Manfred Chung Man",2009,THES,Ph.D.,reviewer2,Andreas
,Synthesis Of Strategies For Non-Zero-Sum Repeated Games,"There are numerous applications that involve two or more self-interested autonomous agents that repeatedly interact with each other in order to achieve a goal or maximize their utilities. This dissertation focuses on the problem of how to identify and exploit useful structures in agents’ behavior for the construction of good strategies for agents in multi-agent environments, particularly non-zero-sum repeated games.   This dissertation makes four contributions to the study of this problem. First, this thesis describes a way to take a set of interaction traces produced by different pairs of players in a two-player repeated game, and then find the best way to combine them into a strategy. The strategy can then be incorporated into an existing agent, as an enhancement of the agent's original strategy. In cross-validated experiments involving 126 agents for the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, Iterated Chicken Game, and Iterated Battle of the Sexes, my technique was able to make improvement to the performance of nearly all of the agents. Second, this thesis investigates the issue of uncertainty about goals when a goal-based agent situated in a nondeterministic environment. The results of this investigation include the necessary and sufficiency conditions for such guarantee, and an algorithm for synthesizing a strategy from interaction traces that maximizes the probability of success of an agent even when no strategy can assure the success of the agent. Third, this thesis introduces a technique, Symbolic Noise Detection (SND), for detecting noise (i.e., mistakes or miscommunications) among agents in repeated games. The idea is that if we can build a model of the other agent’s behavior, we can use this model to detect and correct actions that have been affected by noise. In the 20th Anniversary Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma competition, the SND agent placed third in the “noise” category, and was the best performer among programs that had no ""slave"" programs feeding points to them. Fourth, the thesis presents a generalization of SND that can be wrapped around any existing strategy. Finally, the thesis includes a general framework for synthesizing strategies from experience for repeated games in both noisy and noisy-free environments.",pq_id,304564235,proquest_dt,NA,"Au, Tsz-Chiu",2008,THES,Ph.D.,reviewer2,Andreas

,College Men’s Psychological And Physiological Responses Associated With Violent Video Game Play. Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B.,"Research suggests that playing violent video games increases the likelihood of aggression. However, less clear is how individual characteristics influence the mechanisms that lead to aggression. Using Anderson and Bushman’s (2002) General Aggression Model as a framework, the present study examined the independent and joint effects of individual differences and situational factors on affective and physiological reactivity to playing a violent video game. One hundred thirty-three participants completed self-report measures of trait aggression and violent video game exposure. They were randomly assigned to groups instructed to play a video game using either violent or nonviolent strategies while facial electromyography, heart rate, and electrodermal activity were measured. Positive and negative affect was assessed via self-report prior to and following video game play. It was hypothesized that trait aggression and level of past exposure to violent video games would be positively related to increases in physiological arousal and negative affect among participants in a violent, relative to a nonviolent, condition. Hierarchical regression analyses failed to detect a significant relationship between trait aggression and changes in heart rate, facial electromyography, or self-reported affect as a function of game condition. However, significant positive relationships were found between trait aggression and skin conductance, but only in the nonviolent condition. Analyses revealed that past exposure to violent video games was positively related to increased skin conductance among participants in the non-violent, but not the violent video game condition. Past exposure to violent video games was also positively related to increased heart rate, but this was among participants in the violent, but not the non-violent condition. Significant relationships between past exposure to violent video games and changes in facial electromyography and self-reported affect as a function of video game condition were not found. Findings are discussed in terms of how trait aggression and past exposure to violent video games influence arousal, and potentially, the likelihood of aggressive behavior.",no_id,anderson2010_58,anderson2010,"Powell, C.

,Dissociation Between Sympathetic-Adrenal And Pituitary-Adrenal Responses To An Achievement Situation Characterized By High Controllability: Comparison Between Type A And Type B Males And Females.,"24 coronary-prone (Type A) and 24 noncoronary prone (Type B) Swedish college students were administered the Jenkins Activity Survey for Health Prediction. Ss were asked to complete a choice-reaction task designed to allow them to perform at their own pace and to maintain control over the stimulus rate throughout a sustained work period. Type A's selected faster stimulus rates and coped more effectively with their work load than did Type B's with their lesser load. The superior achievement of Type A's was not reflected in self-reports of subjective arousal nor in physiological arousal indices (e.g., heart rate and catecholamine and cortisol excretion). Males reported exerting significantly more effort than females and, accordingly, secreted significantly more adrenalin. A characteristic common to Ss was the dissociation between sympathetic-adrenal and pituitary-adrenal arousal, catecholamine output increase, and cortisol output decrease in response to achievement demands. The rise in catecholamine output is interpreted in terms of the mobilization of effort induced by the task, and the decrease of cortisol is explained by the high level of personal control in performing the task.",no_id,nagy2015_13,nagy2015,Biological Psychology,"Frankenhaeuser, M., Lundberg, U., Forsman, L.",1980,NA,NA,reviewer2,Andreas
,Effects Of Videogame Play In Boys: An Examination Of Adrenocortical Activity And Behavior.,"Abstract: This study sought to extend the literature on the effects of videogame play in young children, as well as extend and support the developmental psychobiological literature on cortisol-stress response in young children, including its relation to age and temperament. Cortisol levels, aggression, attention, and compliance were measured before and after play with a non-violent videogame for the treatment group, and before and after a children’s television program for the control group. Participants were 75 typically developing 5 to 7 year-old boys with videogame play experience, and their families. Children participated in a 1- hour laboratory session that included pre and posttest measures of salivary cortisol, free-play, and attention. A posttest interview was also administered to measure levels of interpersonal aggression. Parents completed three surveys: The Child Behavior Questionnaire (Ahadi, Rothbart, & Ye, 1993); The Child Behavior Checklist (Achenbach, & Edelbrock, 1981); and a demographic questionnaire. Parents also completed a posttest phone interview to assess child non-compliance. Data reported here confirm that boys who played routine, non-violent videogames demonstrated a significant increase in observable levels of object aggression immediately after videogame play, as well as an increase in non-compliance to parental requests for several hours after videogame play. In support of previous research (e.g., Davis, Donzella, Krueger, & Gunnar, 1999), children who scored higher on the temperamental dimension of surgency/extraversion exhibited significantly higher levels of cortisol two hours-posttest than non-surgent children. Boys in the videogame condition had higher levels of cortisol than boys in the control condition two hours posttest, but this effect was independent of temperamental profile, and did not reflect a within subject increase in cortisol. Contrary to expectations, older, not younger, children demonstrated increased levels of aggression, younger boys did not differ from older boys on levels of cortisol, and attention was not compromised by videogame play. The behavioral effects of videogame play warrant precautionary measures for surgent and non-surgent children with regard to routine videogame exposure. Suggestions for future researchers include longer-term follow-up, expansion of age ranges, and greater numbers of cortisol collections.

,"Individual Differences Affect Hormonal Responses To A Team- Based Violent Videogame Competition, But Not In Solitary Play.","Testosterone levels have been shown to increase in response to interpersonal challenge, and winners of these challenges have been shown to exhibit testosterone increases and cortisol decreases post challenge, whereas losers show decreases in testosterone and increases in cortisol. These challenge responses are thought to facilitate behaviors instrumental in gaining and maintaining status in human and primate dominance hierarchies. However, the vast majority of human studies designed to test this hypothesis have been based on one-on-one competitions, often viewed by teammates or other spectators. The latter introduces an additional social evaluative component to the challenge, on top of the one-on-one competition. It is possible the hormonal responses associated with the challenge response are related to the facilitating or debilitating response to the presence of others and not to the challenge per se. Moreover, few studies have evaluated the challenge response during coalitional competition, which has been important during human evolutionary history. In this study, a violent videogame was used to simulate competition in three different social contexts. The first two were social and consisted of two matches back-to- back. The first match was among the three members of 24 experimentally induced teams, the winner of which then competed against the winner from a different team. In the teammates present condition (12 teams), all teammates remained and observed the winner’s second match, replicating the conditions common to sporting events. In the teammates absent condition (12 teams), teammates were dismissed following the first match and thus were not present during the winner’s match. The third condition was non- social (n = 25); the goal was to remove the social context from the competition, allowing an unconfounded one-on-one challenge response. Further, extroversion, social phobia,social dominance orientation, and a measure of in-group moral reasoning were administered to assess if individual differences on these social dimensions were related to competitors’ social challenge response. In the one-on-one condition, individual differences did not predict hormone levels, nor did testosterone increase for winners but winners had lower pre- and post-match cortisol levels than losers. In the social conditions, better video game performance was associated with higher cortisol, but was not related to testosterone. However, in general cortisol showed decreases across the first match, with individuals who scored highly on the in-group measure showing greater decreases in cortisol. Similarly individuals scoring highly on social phobia showed higher pre-match cortisol which decreased less in the teammates present condition and more in the teammates absent condition. Moreover, extraverts from the teammate’s present condition showed similar cortisol response to the introverts, but extraverts in the absent condition showing lower cortisol than introverts pre-match and post-match. Due to insufficient power, detailed examination of these individual differences effects were not possible for the second match, but there were across match differences in mean hormone levels. Players in the teammate’s present condition had higher testosterone and higher cortisol during the second match than did players in the teammates absent condition. In conclusion, the social conditions, pre- and post-match hormonal responses varied with individual differences in social phobia, extroversion/introversion, and in- group orientation, patterns that were not observed in the non-social condition. Moreover, contrasting the social conditions with the silent condition shows that individuals were mounting a similar stress response to either winning in the social conditions or losing in the silent condition. Otherwise, the null findings from the silent condition are novel and suggest that testosterone changes in response to winning are only relevant with an audience, without which status is irrelevant.",no_id,nagy2015_27,nagy2015,NA,"Oxford, J.

,"Lang, M. K. (1984). The Effects Of Competitive And Cooperative Video Game Play On The Aggressive Behavior Of 6- And 7-Year-Old Males (Unpublished Doctoral Dissertation). Auburn University.","The purpose of this study was to determine differences in physical and object aggression of 6- and 7-year-old white males after playing competitive and cooperative video games when compared to a baseline condition. The instrument used in this study was a behavioral coding form used by Silvern et al. (1983a, 1983b) to score the aggressive and prosocial behavior of each subject during a baseline condition and after each treatment condition (i.e., television viewing and video game play in the first study, and competitive and cooperative video game play in the second study). A time sampling method to analyze the video tape recorded play behavior of pairs of subjects was used by two judges with an interrater reliability of .85 or higher. The sample included 26 white, males who were 6- and 7-years old. All subjects participated in the baseline and treatment conditions. Data were analyzed using an analysis of variance repeated measures design. Separate analyses of variance were performed for object and physical aggression. A significant difference was found for object aggression F (2, 50) = 6.06, p < .01. A Sheffe post hoc comparison was performed to determine the origin of the significant difference. This post hoc procedure revealed that the object aggression scores were found to be significantly higher in the baseline condition than in the competitive treatment condition. No significant difference was found for physical aggression.",no_id,anderson2010_127,anderson2010,"Lang, M. K. (1984).

,Sex Difference In Testosterone Response To A Video Game Contest.,"Testosterone and cortisol were assayed from saliva samples given by 28 young men and 32 young women (aged 17–35 yrs) before, during, and after competing with a same-sex partner in a video game. The testosterone response to the competition is different in each sex; the cortisol response is the same. Results show that male testosterone rose before the video contest, as if in anticipation of the competition. However, the male Ss did not show the expected postmatch response; male winners' testosterone were no higher than that of male losers. Unlike male testosterone, female testosterone generally decreased throughout the experiment. Trends in testosterone and cortisol are parallel in women, but not in men. Apparently testosterone works differently in competition between men than between women.",no_id,nagy2015_23,nagy2015,Evolution and Human Behavior,"Mazur, A., Susman, E.

,The Effects Of Video Game Violence On Boys’ Articulated Thoughts Of Aggressive Behavioral Intentions. Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B.,"Violent video game exposure is correlated with increased aggressive behavior, decreased academic achievement, decreased leisure activities, decreased self-esteem, and delinquent behavior in children and adults (Anderson, 2004; Anderson & Dill, 2000; Dill & Dill, 1998; Emes, 1997; Funk & Buchman, 1996; Graybill, Kirsch, & Kesselmann, 1985; Irwin & Gross, 1995; Scott, 1995; Van Schie & Weigman, 1997). However, only a few researchers have examined the causal effects of video game violence on children and most of these studies are out-dated. Experimental research with adult populations indicates that violent video game play negatively impacts the emotional state and the cognitive mediation of aggressive behavior. However, the impact of today''s violent video games on children is not known. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of violent video games on boys'' mood and articulated thoughts of aggressive behavior and hostile intent attributions in an experimental setting. Fifty pre-teen boys between the ages of 9 to 12 were randomly assigned to play either a violent or a non-violent video game. The results revealed that the type of video game did not impact spontaneous verbalizations of aggressive behavioral intentions, hostile intent attributions, or negative emotions. However, the boys who played the violent video game evinced increased negative affect following video game play compared to the control group who evinced decreased negative affect following video game play.

,"Video Games And Children: Effects On Leisure Activities, Schoolwork, And Peer Involvement.","Examined the effects of home videogame systems on daily activities for 64 children (aged 9–16 yrs) over a 5-mo period. Three groups were contrasted: a new game group (n = 22), who received a home videogame system in December; an old game group (n = 25), who had owned a videogame for a year; and a no game group (n = 17), who did not own a videogame system. Ss responded to questionnaires about their leisure activities, their school work, and their peer interactions, in both November and March. The new game Ss received an additional assessment in January, 3 wks after 1st receiving their videogame. Results show that an initial high involvement with the videogame soon dropped off. Early decreases in leisure activities (TV, for example) also soon disappeared. School activities and peer involvement were not affected at any point. It is concluded that owning a videogame does not greatly alter a child's activities.
