A., Carnagey, N. L.","Three experiments examined the impact of excessive violence in sport video games on aggression-related variables. Participants played either a nonviolent simulation-based sports video game (baseball or football) or a matched excessively violent sports video game. Participants then completed measures assessing aggressive cognitions (Experiment 1), aggressive affect and attitudes towards violence in sports (Experiment 2), or aggressive behavior (Experiment 3). Playing an excessively violent sports video game increased aggressive affect, aggressive cognition, aggressive behavior, and attitudes towards violence in sports. Because all games were competitive, these findings indicate that violent content uniquely leads to increases in several aggression-related variables, as predicted by the General Aggression Model and related social–cognitive models."

Experiment 1 found that violent video games in general increase the accessibility of aggressive thoughts. Experiments 2 and 3 found that playing violent video games increased aggression, even when arousal and affect were controlled. Experiments 2 and 3 also found that trait hostility and trait aggression were positively related to laboratory aggression. Furthermore, there was correlational evidence of a link between repeated exposure to violent video games and trait aggressiveness. Mediational analyses suggested that the trait effects and the violent video game effects on laboratory aggression were partially mediated by revenge motivation. The correlational study uncovered links among habitual exposure to violent video games, persistent aggressive cognitions, and self-reported aggressive behavior. The meta-analyses revealed significant effects of violent video games on aggressive behavior, affect, and cognition; on cardiovascular arousal; and on prosocial behavior."

Study 1 found that real-life violent video game play was positively related to aggressive behavior and delinquency. The relation was stronger for individuals who are characteristically aggressive and for men. Academic achievement was negatively related to overall amount of time spent playing video games. In Study 2, laboratory exposure to a graphically violent video game increased aggressive thoughts and behavior. In both studies, men had a more hostile view of the world than did women. The results from both studies are consistent with the General Affective Aggression Model, which predicts that exposure to violent video games will increase aggressive behavior in both the short term (e.g., laboratory aggression) and the long term (e.g., delinquency).

In the first experiment, college student subjects played 11 different video games and rated them on a number of characteristics. From these ratings, two games were selected for use in Experiment 2. These games differed only in the level of aggression displayed. One was highly aggressive; the other was only mildly aggressive. In Experiment 2, each subject played one of the games or was assigned to a no-game control condition. Hostility, anxiety, and depression subsequently were assessed by the Multiple Affect Adjective Checklist. Hostility was increased in both game conditions, relative to the control group. The high-aggression game led to higher hostility than the mild-aggression game, but the difference was not significant. However, those who had played the high-aggression game were significantly more anxious than either those who played the mild-aggression game or those who played no game (control). As expected, the experimental manipulation of game playing did not yield a main effect on depressive affect. Finally, there was a marginally significant sex by game interaction effect on the depression scores."

A., Ihori, N., Shibuya, A., Yukawa, S., . . . Kobayashi, K.","CONTEXT. Youth worldwide play violent video games many hours per week. Previous research suggests that such exposure can increase physical aggression.OBJECTIVE. We tested whether high exposure to violent video games increases physical aggression over time in both high- (United States) and low- (Japan) violence cultures. We hypothesized that the amount of exposure to violent video games early in a school year would predict changes in physical aggressiveness assessed later in the school year, even after statistically controlling for gender and previous physical aggressiveness. DESIGN. In 3 independent samples, participants’ video game habits and physically aggressive behavior tendencies were assessed at 2 points in time, separated by 3 to 6 months.PARTICIPANTS. One sample consisted of 181 Japanese junior high students ranging in age from 12 to 15 years. A second Japanese sample consisted of 1050 students ranging in age from 13 to 18 years. The third sample consisted of 364 United States 3rd-, 4th-, and 5th-graders ranging in age from 9 to 12 years. RESULTS. Habitual violent video game play early in the school year predicted later aggression, even after controlling for gender and previous aggressiveness in each sample. Those who played a lot of violent video games became relatively more physically aggressive. Multisample structure equation modeling revealed that this longitudinal effect was of a similar magnitude in the United States and Japan for similar-aged youth and was smaller (but still significant) in the sample that included older youth.CONCLUSIONS. These longitudinal results confirm earlier experimental and cross-sectional studies that had suggested that playing violent video games is a significant risk factor for later physically aggressive behavior and that this violent video game effect on youth generalizes across very different cultures. As a whole, the research strongly suggests reducing the exposure of youth to this risk factor."

One theory posits that repeated exposure to media violence desensitizes viewers to real world violence, increasing aggression by blunting aversive reactions to violence and removing normal inhibitions against aggression. Theoretically, violence desensitization should be reflected in the amplitude of the P300 component of the event-related brain potential (ERP), which has been associated with activation of the aversive motivational system. In the current study, violent images elicited reduced P300 amplitudes among violent, as compared to nonviolent video game players. Additionally, this reduced brain response predicted increased aggressive behavior in a later task. Moreover, these effects held after controlling for individual differences in trait aggressiveness. These data are the first to link media violence exposure and aggressive behavior to brain processes hypothetically associated with desensitization."

A lab experiment showed that individuals low in VVE behave more aggressively after playing a violent video game than after a nonviolent game but that those high in VVE display relatively high levels of aggression regardless of game content. Mediational analyses show that trait hostility, empathy, and hostile perceptions partially account for the VVE effect on aggression. These findings suggest that repeated exposure to video game violence increases aggressive behavior in part via changes in cognitive and personality factors associated with desensitization."

Intervention  Men who had previously reported differing amounts of lifetime home and community violence were randomly assigned to play The Simpsons: Hit and Run (low-violence condition) or Grand Theft Auto III (high-violence condition).Main Outcome Measures  Systolic and diastolic blood pressure; negative affect; hostile social information processing; uncooperative behavior; and permissive attitudes toward violence, alcohol use, marijuana use, and sexual activity without condom use. Results  Men randomly assigned to play Grand Theft Auto III exhibited greater increases in diastolic blood pressure from a baseline rest period to game play, greater negative affect, more permissive attitudes toward using alcohol and marijuana, and more uncooperative behavior in comparison with men randomly assigned to play The Simpsons. Only among participants with greater exposure to home and community violence, play of Grand Theft Auto III led to elevated systolic blood pressure in comparison with play of The Simpsons (mean, 13 vs 5 mm Hg).

Play was not linked to self-esteem in girls, but a negative relationship was obtained between self-esteem and frequency of play in boys. However, self-esteem was not associated with total exposure to game play. Aggression scores were not related to the number of games with aggressive content named among three favourite games, but they were positively correlated with total exposure to game play. A multiple regression analysis revealed that sex and total game play exposure each accounted for a significant but small amount of the variance in aggression scores. The positive correlation between playing computer games and aggression provides some justification for further investigation of the causal hypothesis, and possible methodologies are discussed."

The effects of video game play on mood, physiological arousal and psychomotor performance","The effects of computer video game play have been a controversial topic actively pursued by the media. Although psychologists, medical experts and the Surgeon General have suggested that the games cause various deleterious effects on social behavior, while others believe that the games can produce beneficial effects in the form of transfer of training, no research has been done to investigate these questions in an experimental setting. The present study examines three major questions that have been raised about video game play. The first question centers on the possible negative effects caused by playing some video games which are aggressive in theme content. The second question centers around whether or not the games produce unhealthy changes in physiological arousal. The third question focuses on whether possible benefits such as improved eye-hand coodination, can be brought on by video game play. Independent variables in this study were activity (video game play vs. television watching vs. dart game play); aggressive theme content (high vs. low); and time on task (fifteen minutes vs. one half hour). Dependent variables were mood, physiological arousal and performance ability as a function of manipulative aptitude. Subjects were 72 college undergraduates and the design was a 3 x 2 x 2 factorial design. No hypotheses were made because of the lack of experimental data on which to base theories. Data analysis was subject to a strict set of conventions designed to reduce the dangers inherent in post-hoc analyses. The major finding of the study suggested that video game play and television watching are not as similar as some have suggested. While all aggressive conditions produced increased self-reports of hostility, the high aggression video game condition produced less aggression than the low aggressive television condition. The aggressive dart game group showed highest self-reports of hostility. No effects were found for transfer to a performance task. A significant theme by time on task interaction was found for heart rate suggesting that high aggression for short time periods increased physiological arousal, which decreases under high time on task. Results of the study were used to examine catharsis, arousal and social learning models of aggression. Issues concerning the social scientist''s responsibility in the media, changes brought about by technology and future research models for studying computer games are discussed."

The current study examined the contributions of gender and personality, exposure to physical abuse and violence in the family, and exposure to media violence in both television and in video games on violent criminal activity. Data from young adults (n = 355) indicated that personality characteristics and direct physical abuse significantly predicted violent crime. Exposure to television and video game violence were not significant predictors of violent crime. These results elucidate the complex interplay between multiple factors related to the etiology of violent crime. These results also call into question the belief that media violence is involved in the etiology of violent crime."

Study 2 examined correlations between trait aggression, violent criminal acts, and exposure to both violent games and family violence. Results indicated that trait aggression, family violence, and male gender were predictive of violent crime, but exposure to violent games was not. Structural equation modeling suggested that family violence and innate aggression as predictors of violent crime were a better fit to the data than was exposure to video game violence.

The goal of the present study was to determine if there are relationships between real-life and media violence exposure and desensitization as reflected in related characteristics. One hundred fifty fourth and fifth graders completed measures of real-life violence exposure, media violence exposure, empathy, and attitudes towards violence. Regression analyses indicated that only exposure to video game violence was associated with (lower) empathy. Both video game and movie violence exposure were associated with stronger proviolence attitudes. The active nature of playing video games, intense engagement, and the tendency to be translated into fantasy play may explain negative impact, though causality was not investigated in the present design. The samples’ relatively low exposure to real-life violence may have limited the identification of relationships. Although difficult to quantify, desensitization to violence should be further studied using related characteristics as in the present study. Individual differences and causal relationships should also be examined"

Theoretically, games in which game characters help and support each other in nonviolent ways should increase both short-term and long-term prosocial behaviors. We report three studies conducted in three countries with three age groups to test this hypothesis. In the correlational study, Singaporean middle-school students who played more prosocial games behaved more prosocially. In the two longitudinal samples of Japanese children and adolescents, prosocial game play predicted later increases in prosocial behavior. In the experimental study, U.S. undergraduates randomly assigned to play prosocial games behaved more prosocially toward another student. These similar results across different methodologies, ages, and cultures provide robust evidence of a prosocial game content effect, and they provide support for the General Learning Model."

J.","This article presents conceptual and empirical analyses of several of the “best practices” of learning and instruction, and demonstrates how violent video games use them effectively to motivate learners to persevere in acquiring and mastering a number of skills, to navigate through complex problems and changing environments, and to experiment with different identities until success is achieved. These educational principles allow for the generation of several testable hypotheses, two of which are tested with samples of 430 elementary school children (mean age 10 years), 607 young adolescents (mean age 14 years), and 1,441 older adolescents (mean age 19 years). Participants were surveyed about their video game habits and their aggressive cognitions and behaviors. The first hypothesis is based on the principle that curricula that teach the same underlying concepts across contexts should have the highest transfer. Therefore, students who play multiple violent video games should be more likely to learn aggressive cognitions and behaviors than those who play fewer. The second hypothesis is based on the principle that long-term learning is improved the more practice is distributed across time. Therefore, students who play violent video games more frequently across time should be more likely to learn aggressive cognitions and behaviors than those who play the same types of games for equivalent amounts of time but less frequently. Both hypotheses were supported. We conclude by describing what educators can learn from the successful instructional and curriculum design features of video games."

In addition, path analyses were conducted to test mediational pathways from video game habits to outcomes. Six hundred and seven 8th- and 9th-grade students from four schools participated. Adolescents who expose themselves to greater amounts of video game violence were more hostile, reported getting into arguments with teachers more frequently, were more likely to be involved in physical fights, and performed more poorly in school. Mediational pathways were found such that hostility mediated the relationship between violent video game exposure and outcomes.

Results indicated that, as predicted, participants who played the violent video game produced more aggressive thoughts than those who played the nonviolent game; however, contrary to our hypothesis, trait aggression did not moderate this relationship; i.e., the effects on playing the violent video game on aggressive cognitions were not statistically larger (or smaller) for those participants who scored high on the trait aggression index than for those who scored low. Using data obtained by measuring participants’ playing style during while playing 24: The Game, the results reveal that individuals do, indeed, tend to play video games, at least violent video games, in relatively different ways; in fact, the number of inPREVIEW vi game violent acts committed by players varied substantially (from a low of 57 acts to a high of 255 acts).

However, results also indicated that a more aggressive playing style did, in fact, predict aggressive thoughts. Drawing on the theories of neo-associationism and GAM, this study offers an innovative approach to gaming research by considering one’s in-game aggressive playing style as well as individual difference variables (i.e. trait aggressiveness) in investigating the aggressive outcomes of violent video game play"

However, less clear is how individual characteristics influence the mechanisms that lead to aggression. Using Anderson and Bushman’s (2002) General Aggression Model as a framework, the present study examined the independent and joint effects of individual differences and situational factors on affective and physiological reactivity to playing a violent video game. One hundred thirty-three participants completed self-report measures of trait aggression and violent video game exposure. They were randomly assigned to groups instructed to play a video game using either violent or nonviolent strategies while facial electromyography, heart rate, and electrodermal activity were measured. Positive and negative affect was assessed via self-report prior to and following video game play. It was hypothesized that trait aggression and level of past exposure to violent video games would be positively related to increases in physiological arousal and negative affect among participants in a violent, relative to a nonviolent, condition. Hierarchical regression analyses failed to detect a significant relationship between trait aggression and changes in heart rate, facial electromyography, or self-reported affect as a function of game condition. However, significant positive relationships were found between trait aggression and skin conductance, but only in the nonviolent condition. Analyses revealed that past exposure to violent video games was positively related to increased skin conductance among participants in the non-violent, but not the violent video game condition. Past exposure to violent video games was also positively related to increased heart rate, but this was among participants in the violent, but not the non-violent condition. Significant relationships between past exposure to violent video games and changes in facial electromyography and self-reported affect as a function of video game condition were not found. Findings are discussed in terms of how trait aggression and past exposure to violent video games influence arousal, and potentially, the likelihood of aggressive behavior."

As hypothesized, digital game violence was linked to direct aggression both longitudinally and synchronously, and the link was moderated by parent–child communication in interaction with sex and age. Results suggest that the moderating role of parent–child communication changes with increasing age. Poor parent–child communication may be one of the factors in an adolescent's development that may strengthen the negative effects of digital game violence, but even good parent–child communication does not necessarily protect the adolescent in the long run.

Each participant's game play was recorded and content analyzed on a frame-by-frame basis. Onscreen activities were coded as either ""passive/dead, no interactions""; ""active/safe, no imminent danger/no violent interactions""; ""active/potential danger occurs, violent interactions expected""; ""active/under attack, some violent interactions""; and ""active/fighting and killing, many violent interactions."" Previous studies in neuroscience on aggressive thoughts and behaviors suggested that virtual violence would suppress affective areas of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the amygdala subsequent to activity variations at cognitive areas of the ACC. Comparison of game play activities with and without virtual violence in 11 participants confirmed the hypothesis. The rather large observed effects can be considered as caused by the virtual violence. We discuss the applicability of neuroscience methodology in media effects studies, with a special emphasis on the assumption of virtuality prevalent in video game play."

The current paper uses video game violence research as an example of how such issues may develop in a field. Despite decades of research, evidence on whether violent video games (VVGs) contribute to aggression in players has remained mixed. Concerns have been raised in recent years that experiments regarding VVGs may suffer from both “false positives” and “false negatives.” The current paper examines this issue in three sets of video game experiments, two sets of video game experiments on aggression and prosocial behaviors identified in meta-analysis, and a third group of recent null studies. Results indicated that studies of VVGs and aggression appear to be particularly prone to false positive results. Studies of VVGs and prosocial behavior, by contrast are heterogeneous and did not demonstrate any indication of false positive results. However, their heterogeneous nature made it difficult to base solid conclusions on them. By contrast, evidence for false negatives in null studies was limited, and little evidence emerged that null studies lacked power in comparison those highlighted in past meta-analyses as evidence for effects. These results are considered in light of issues related to false positives and negatives in behavioral science more broadly."

One hundred male undergraduates aged 18-21 who had previously reported low or high lifetime amounts of violence were randomly assigned to play a videogame low (The Simpsons: Hit and Run) or high (Grand Theft Auto III; GTA III) in violent content. Participants randomly assigned to GTA III exhibited greater changes in systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure from the initial rest period to game play, and greater negative affect subsequent to game play, in comparison to adolescents randomly assigned to The Simpsons. Participants randomly assigned to GTA III also exhibited more permissive attitudes towards drinking alcohol and using marijuana and were more competitive during a subsequent task. Greater lifetime violence exposure was associated with greater changes in SBP and pulse rate from the initial rest period to game play and with more permissive attitudes towards violence and drinking alcohol. Two interactions between lifetime violence exposure and laboratory media violence condition were found. Within the low lifetime violence exposure group, videogame condition was not associated with change in SBP from the initial rest period to game play, while within the high lifetime violence exposure group, play of Grand Theft Auto III predicted greater changes in SBP. Lifetime community violence exposure interacted with laboratory media violence condition in predicting hostile attributions. Within the high community violence exposure group, play of GTA III was associated with greater likelihood that participants would think a teacher would accuse them of cheating. The present study is the first experimental study to show that media violence is associated with permissive attitudes towards health risk behaviors that do not directly involve hostility or aggression, such as alcohol and marijuana use. Media violence effects observed in the laboratory may be representative of how any type of violence exposure influences youth, including real-world violence within homes and communities. One consequence of acute or chronic violence exposure among young men may be a greater willingness to engage in generally risky behavior."

With video games becoming increasingly violent and realistic, it is important to assess their impact. Thus, the purpose of this study was to test the effect of playing violent video games on children''s aggression, arousal, and desensitization to violence. One hundred and twenty-four male sixth- through eighth-graders were randomly assigned to play either a violent video game, a nonviolent video game, or to a control condition where subjects played a simple puzzle. The independent measures consisted of game played, past video game experience, and baseline aggression. The dependent measures consisted of aggression, arousal, and desensitization. Baseline levels of projective aggression were measured with the Child Hostility Inventory (CHI) and post-treatment levels of projective aggression were measured with the Multiple Adjective Check List (MACL). Post-treatment behavioral aggression was measured by the intensity of noxious noise delivered to an opponent in a competitive game. Physiological arousal (heart rate) was monitored with a pulse meter at designated times throughout the experimental conditions. Desensitization did demonstrate that past play experience was related to post-treatment behavioral aggression even when initial levels of aggression were controlled, but was not related to arousal or desensitization. Also demonstrated was that baseline aggression was related to behavioral and projective aggression.
The results are discussed within the context of some of the prominent theories of the transmission of aggressive behavior via violent media, specifically social learning theory and drive theory. Social learning theory was found to be a valuable framework for understanding the effect of video games on children and adolescents. Implications for research on video games are discussed."

A principal components analysis of a scale to measure needs met by game play resulted in the same two previously obtained factors; ‘companionship’ and ‘prefer to friends’. However, in contrast to the UK sample, ‘companionship’ did not relate to play. A positive relation between the ‘prefer to friends’ factor and play was obtained for both boys and girls (boys only in the UK), thus providing support for the ‘electronic friendship’ hypothesis. There was evidence of a positive relation between play and aggression, but a preference for aggressive games was associated with lower aggression scores, and this raises questions for the ‘causal hypothesis’."

The present research sought to develop increased understanding of video game violence through focus on two poorly understood areas of the literature: (Study 1) the relationship between violence, physiological arousal and attitudes toward guns and violence; (Study 2) the influence of violence on the way boys perceive goodness and badness. In order to address both research areas, 45 boys, ranging in age from 16-19 were randomly assigned to one of three separate groups that would be exposed to differing levels of video game violence. They were provided questionnaires before playing the games that assessed: (a) attitudes toward guns and violence; (b) thoughts and feelings on goodness and badness, and (c) video gaming habits. A week later, baseline measures of arousal (heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure) were obtained for each participant prior to game play. After playing a non-violent game or another game with violence features turned on or off, each participant had a post heart rate blood pressure reading taken and completed a post survey on goodness and badness. The results of Study 1 did not find significant change in heart rate or blood pressure for either the control condition or for the groups exposed to differing levels of violence over a 30 minute game play period. Furthermore, there was no evidence that attitudes toward guns and violence or race influenced physiological response. In the context of the literature on arousal, the results suggest that arousal as a factor of violence does occur though it is ephemeral. Study 2 sought to explore whether violence in video games might be a venue for adolescents to explore ethical self-development; and whether this exploration may be evident in how they articulate goodness and badness. Although statistically significant change was noted on individual survey questions, overall, change was minimal. While the results do not support the proposed theoretical model, further suggestions for exploration are discussed."

An alternative possibility is that game play may be associated with positive features of development, as the games reflect and contribute to participation in a challenging and stimulating voluntary leisure environment. This study examined the relationship between game play and several measures of adjustment or risk taking in a sample of 16-year-old high school students. No evidence was obtained of negative outcomes among game players. On several measures—including family closeness, activity involvement, positive school engagement, positive mental health, substance use, self-concept, friendship network, and disobedience to parents—game players scored more favorably than did peers who never played computer games.

Cortisol levels, aggression, attention, and compliance were measured before and after play with a non-violent videogame for the treatment group, and before and after a children''s television program for the control group. Participants were 75 typically developing 5 to 7 year-old boys with videogame play experience, and their families. Children participated in a 1-½ hour laboratory session that included pre and posttest measures of salivary cortisol, free-play, and attention. A posttest interview was also administered to measure levels of interpersonal aggression. Parents completed three surveys: The Child Behavior Questionnaire (Ahadi, Rothbart, & Ye, 1993); The Child Behavior Checklist (Achenbach, & Edelbrock, 1981); and a demographic questionnaire. Parents also completed a posttest phone interview to assess child non-compliance. Data reported here confirm that boys who played routine, non-violent videogames demonstrated a significant increase in observable levels of object aggression immediately after videogame play, as well as an increase in non-compliance to parental requests for several hours after videogame play. In support of previous research (e.g., Davis, Donzella, Krueger, & Gunnar, 1999), children who scored higher on the temperamental dimension of surgency/extraversion exhibited significantly higher levels of cortisol two hours-posttest than non-surgent children. Boys in the videogame condition had higher levels of cortisol than boys in the control condition two hours posttest, but this effect was independent of temperamental profile, and did not reflect a within subject increase in cortisol. Contrary to expectations, older, not younger, children demonstrated increased levels of aggression, younger boys did not differ from older boys on levels of cortisol, and attention was not compromised by videogame play. The behavioral effects of videogame play warrant precautionary measures for surgent and non-surgent children with regard to routine videogame exposure. Suggestions for future researchers include longer-term follow-up, expansion of age ranges, and greater numbers of cortisol collections."

It was predicted that a preference for violent games would be associated with negative externalizing characteristics, in particular aggressive emotions and behaviors, on the Youth Self-Report (YSR), a standardized self-report measure of adolescent problem behaviors. Thirty-two 11- through 15-year-olds (17 girls) listed and categorized favorite electronic games into one of six predetermined categories and completed the YSR. MANOVA revealed significant relationships between a preference for violent games and the Thought Problems subscale (P < .01) and YSR Total Score (P < .05), with trends noted for the Internalizing (P < .06) and Anxious-Depressed (P < .08) subscales. Expected relationships with externalizing behaviors, including aggression, were not found. However, across all YSR subscales, children with higher preference for violent games had more clinically significant elevations than those with low preference for violent games. On the Total Problems subscale, of the eight children receiving scores in the clinically significant range, six were in the High preference group (three boys and three girls). The failure to find the expected relationships between a preference for violent games and aggressive, externalizing behaviors is puzzling. It is possible that individuals with a preference for violent games may have high exposure to all forms of media violence. Their perceptions of their own behavior, in comparison, may not seem sufficiently aggressive to justify endorsement of problems in this area. Or, playing violent electronic games may promote a disconnection between the emotions normally associated with violence and violent acts. These explanations are consistent with a desensitization model where exposure to media violence decreases sensitivity to aggression. Aggr. Behav. 28:134–144, 2002. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

Two hundred and one preadolescent boys age 10-13 from six rural school districts completed a questionnaire containing items measuring the variables of interest and were rated on physical and verbal aggression by classroom teachers. Correlational analysis determined general relationships between criterion and predictor variables. Multivariate regression analysis revealed a significant overall relationship between predictor and criterion variables. There were no relationships between any predictor variables and teacher ratings of verbal and physical aggression. Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that self-reported measures were the only criterion variables that demonstrated significance. High levels of masculine ideology endorsement were significantly correlated with higher scores on self-reported aggression, and lower scores on aggression control, indicating that masculine ideology plays a significant role in the early formation of behavioral norms more approving of aggression. Full model regression indicated that endorsement of traditional beliefs about the male role was a more significant predictor of self-reported aggression than exposure to media violence or time spent playing video games. Also, boys who spent more time with fathers, scored significantly lower on self-reported aggression and were less inclined to endorse traditional male attitudes. The present study indicates that endorsement of traditional beliefs about the male role is a more significant predictor of self-reported aggressive behavior than exposure to media violence and time spent playing video games. It also indicates that boys who spend more time with an adult male in the role of parent, report lower levels of aggression and lower levels of endorsement of traditional male attitudes."

I., Weinstein, L.","This paper presents an empirical study of the relationship of heavy video game use in adolescent male subjects to personality and psychopathological factors. Based on the nature of the games and on developmental theory, it was hypothesized that heavy video game use plays a role in managing developmental conflicts, particularly with regard to the discharge of aggression and the open expression of competition, and does not result in increased neuroticism, social withdrawal, or escape into fantasy. Heavy video game users were also hypothesized to have lower frustration tolerance. A study of 208 adolescent male subjects supported these hypotheses. The results were discussed in terms of the need for mastery of experiences, and in terms of the reawakening of Oedipal conflicts in adolescence as described by Blos. It was stressed that much of the anxiety about video games represents a parental issue, akin to parental overreactions to other adolescent outlets."

Methods A national representative sample of 4222 schoolchildren (7th- and 8th-graders; mean age 13.9 years) answered questions on the frequency of television-viewing, electronic game-playing, feeling unsafe at school, bullying others, hitting others, and fighting with others, as part of the Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children (HBSC) international collaborative study protocol. The Chi-square tests and multiple logistic regression analyses were applied to high-risk groups of adolescents. Results For the total sample, all bivariate relationships between television-viewing/electronic game-playing and each violence-related variable are significant. In the multivariate comparison, physical violence among boys ceases to be significant. For girls, only television-viewing is linked to indirect violence. Against the hypothesis, females’ electronic game-playing only had a bearing on hitting others. Conclusions Experimental designs are needed that take into account gender, different forms of media, and violence to answer the question of whether excessive media use leads to violent behavior. With the exception of excessive electronic game-playing among girls, this study found that electronic media are not thought to lead directly to real-life violence but to hostility and indirect violence."

Grand theft childhood: The surprising truth about violent video games and what parents can do. New York, NY: Simon & Schuster.",2008,NA,"Kutner, L., Olsen, C.","Listening to pundits and politicians, you'd think that the relationship between violent video games and aggressive behavior in children is clear. Children who play violent video games are more likely to be socially isolated and have poor interpersonal skills. Violent games can trigger real-world violence. The best way to protect our kids is to keep them away from games such as Grand Theft Auto that are rated M for Mature. Right? Wrong. In fact, many parents are worried about the wrong things! In 2004, Lawrence Kutner, PhD, and Cheryl K. Olson, ScD, cofounders and directors of the Harvard Medical School Center for Mental Health and Media, began a $1.5 million federally funded study on the effects of video games. In contrast to previous research, their study focused on real children and families in real situations. What they found surprised, encouraged and sometimes disturbed them: their findings conform to the views of neither the alarmists nor the video game industry boosters. In _Grand Theft Childhood: The Surprising Truth about Violent Video Games and What Parents Can Do_, Kutner and Olson untangle the web of politics, marketing, advocacy and flawed or misconstrued studies that until now have shaped parents' concerns. Instead of offering a one-size-fits-all prescription, _Grand Theft Childhood_ gives the information you need to decide how you want to handle this sensitive issue in your own family. You'll learn when -- and what kinds of -- video games can be harmful, when they can serve as important social or learning tools and how to create and enforce game-playing rules in your household. You'll find out what's really in the games your children play and when to worry about your children playing with strangers on the Internet. You'll understand how games are rated, how to make best use of ratings and the potentially important information that ratings don't provide. _Grand Theft Childhood_ takes video games out of the political and media arenas, and puts parents back in control. It should be required reading for all families who use game consoles or computers. Almost all children today play video or computer games. Half of twelve-year- olds regularly play violent, Mature-rated games. And parents are worried... _""I don't know if it's an addiction, but my son is just glued to it. It's the same with my daughter with her computer...and I can't be watching both of them all the time, to see if they're talking to strangers or if someone is getting killed in the other room on the PlayStation. It's just nerve-racking!"" ""I'm concerned that this game playing is just the kid and the TV screen...how is this going to affect his social skills?"" ""I'm not concerned about the violence; I'm concerned about the way they portray the violence. It's not accidental; it's intentional. They're just out to kill people in some of these games."" _ What should we as parents, teachers and public policy makers be concerned about? The real risks are subtle and aren't just about gore or sex. Video games don't affect all children in the same way; some children are at significantly greater risk. (You may be surprised to learn which ones!) _Grand Theft Childhood_ gives parents practical, research-based advice on ways to limit many of those risks. It also shows how video games -- even violent games -- can benefit children and families in unexpected ways. In this groundbreaking and timely book, Drs. Lawrence Kutner and Cheryl Olson cut through the myths and hysteria, and reveal the surprising truth about kids and violent games."

S., Bushman, B. J.","The objective of this study was to test the effect of individual differences on appeal and use of video games. Participants were 299 adolescent boys from lower and higher secondary schools in the Netherlands and Belgium. In general, boys were most attracted to violent video games. Boys that scored higher in trait aggressiveness and lower in empathy were especially attracted to violent games and spent more time playing video games than did boys lower in trait aggressiveness. Lower educated boys showed more appreciation for both violent and nonviolent games and spent more time playing them than did higher educated boys. The present study showed that aggressive and less empathic boys were most attracted to violent games. The fact that heavy users of violent games show less empathy and higher aggressiveness suggests the possibility of desensitization. Other studies have shown that playing violent games increases aggressiveness and decreases empathy. These results combined suggest the possibility of a violence cycle. Aggressive individuals are attracted to violent games. Playing violent games increases aggressiveness and decreases empathy, which in turn leads to increased appreciation and use of violent games."

In individual sessions, demographic information about the children’s television viewing and video game playing habits was collected. Participants were exposed to one of six following media conditions for 15 minutes; a) watch a violent (wrestling) or a nonviolent video segment (basketball), b) play a violent or a non-violent game, or c) watch a violent or non-violent video segment and then play a video game containing the same characters and content. The potential for violent media to prime aggression was examined by utilizing two cognitive (word-stem completion task and normative beliefs about aggression questionnaire) and one behavioral measure (Bobo doll interaction). Exposure to violent media was expected to lead to increased aggressive thoughts and behaviors in both younger and older children. Younger children were expected to be more strongly influenced by violent media than older children. However, older boys were expected to demonstrate greater priming on the word-completion task. Finally, consistent with Huesmann’s (1986) social developmental theory, the combination of violent video games and violent television content was expected influence children more strongly than either video games or television alone. Key findings of the present research were as follows: 1) Children exposed to violent media content endorsed higher levels of aggressive behavior than did children exposed to non-violent content. 2) Children exposed to violence in the combined media condition endorsed significantly higher levels of aggressive behavior than did those in the non-violent media condition. 3) Sixth-grade boys endorsed higher levels of aggressive behavior and produced more aggressive words on the word-stem completion task than did third-grade boys. 4) Third-grade boys were more aggressive toward the Bobo doll than were sixth-grade boys."

Four games were investigated: these were Death Race and Demolition Derby, which simulate violent, antisocial driving behavior; and Night Driver and Le Mans, which simulate skilled prosocial driving behavior. Preference for arcade games simulating aggressive behavior was found to be independent of personality and mood. However, preferences were closely related to the performers' c]apabilities. Players who exhibited higher levels of skill preferred the more skilldemanding games and those who showed less skill preferred aggression games, suggesting the operation of competency motivation in that the players preferred games appropriate to their level of skill. Subjects reported that the games were exciting, but extended play produced discomfort or an increase in negatively toned moods (fatigue, anxiety, and depression) and a decrease in positively toned moods (social affection, surgency, skepticism, concentration and vigor).

This study was conducted to estimate the prevalence of having been engaged in physical fighting on school property and associated factors of the behavior among school-going adolescents in the United States. Methods This study was based on secondary analysis of the United States Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) conducted in 2005. The sampling frame included all private and public school in the country, stratified by region and urbanicity based on the US census bureau data. Frequencies and proportions were obtained for the outcome and explanatory variables. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the level of association between explanatory variables and the outcome (having been involved in a physical fight). Results Of the 13,857 respondents, 13.5% (18.2% for males and 8.8% for females) reported physical fighting onschool property in the last 12 months to the survey. Males were more likely to have been in a physical fight than females (OR = 2.23; 95% CI [1.89, 2.63]). Respondents aged 17 years or older were less likely to report physical fighting than those who were 14 years or younger. Compared to Whites, American Indians or Alaska Natives, Blacks, Native Hawaii or other Pacific Islanders, and Hispanics were more likely to report physical fighting on school property (OR = 2.11; 95% CI [1.22, 3.66], OR = 1.72; 95% CI [1.42, 2.0], OR = 2.18; 95% CI [1.01, 4.79], and OR = 1.74; 95% CI [1.41, 2.16] respectively). Physical fighting on school property was also positively associated with cigarette smoking (OR = 1.70; 95% CI [1.37, 2.10]), drinking alcohol (OR = 1.45; 95% CI [1.20, 1.76]), use of illegal drugs (OR = 1.73; 95% CI [1.42, 2.12]), having had property stolen or deliberately damaged on school property (OR = 2.06; 95% CI [1.74, 2.44]), having been threatened or injured with a weapon on school property (OR = 2.63; 95% CI [2.06, 3.34]), and playing videogame three or more hours a day (OR = 1.29; 95% CI [1.07, 1.56]). Conclusion These findings suggest that physical fighting among US High School students is widespread and positively associated with victimization (having been threatened or injured with a weapon on school property) and other risky behaviors such as smoking, alcohol and drugs use. Intervention programs to prevent/control those risky behaviors as well as further attention on the association between physical fighting and victimization at school through longitudinal research are warranted."

After playing the game, emotional responses to aversive and aggressive stimuli - pictures from Lang, Bradley, and Cuthbert’s (1999) International Affective Picture System - were assessed with self-ratings and physiological measurement (skin conductance). Results showed no differences in the judgments of emotional responses to the stimuli. However, different effects of game violence emerged in the physiological reactions to the different types of stimulus material. Participants in the high-violence condition showed significantly weaker reactions (desensitization) to aversive stimuli and reacted significantly more strongly (sensitization) to aggressive cues. No support was found for the arousal hypothesis. Post-hoc analyses are used to discuss possible moderating influences of gaming experience and player’s trait aggressiveness in terms of the General Aggression Model (Anderson & Bushman, 2001) and the Downward Spiral Model (Slater, Henry, Swaim, & Anderson, 2003)."

J., Ward, T.","Debate regarding the psychological and behavioural effects of playing violent video games has recently led to claims that violent video games increase aggression effects in adolescents, and that this issue has now been settled. However, other researchers have found either no detrimental effects from game playing or even positive (cathartic) effects. In this research we demonstrate that these different conclusions are not mutually exclusive and can be explained by the method of assessment and analytic techniques utilised. We had adolescents play a violent video game (Quake II) and took measurements of anger both before, during and after game play. The results demonstrated that some people increase, some decrease and the majority show no change in anger ratings. Unlike past research, we also demonstrate that these changes are mediated by the player's feelings immediately prior to game play and a labile temperament – one predisposed to aggression – and that these variables predict people's reactions with an average 73% concordance rate."

University of Southern Mississippi.",1984,THES,"Walker, M. R. (1984). The effects of video games and TV/film violence on subsequent aggression in male adolescents","In the last 10 years, video games have become a five billion dollar industry. A recent Newsweek article quoted ""industry estimates"" that 90% of the customers are men and boys, and 80% are teenagers. Proponents say that video games are creating an entire generation familiar and comfortable with computers, whereas opponents have been particularly concerned over the possibility that video games may make children too willing to accept or even to copy real violence. One basis for this concern has been the large body of research linking exposure to violence on television with the instigation, frequency, and intensity of aggression in young viewers. The present study compared the effects on subsequent aggression of viewing a violent film on TV with playing a home video game in late adolescent boys who had been angered. Anger was provoked by insulting the subject's performance and aggression was studied in terms of resistance to interference from stress, expressed feelings of hostility, personality traits of aggressiveness and hostility, and behavioral manifestations of aggression. The subjects were 60 male adolescents age 18 and 19 enrolled in undergraduate classes. The subjects watched a segment from the film Rocky II, watched a video tape of a jazz trio, or played Space Invaders for about 13 minutes, and then completed the dependent measures. The major predictions of this study were not borne out as only 1 of the 15 hypotheses was supported by the data. The anger manipulation, the neutral film, and the measure of aggression were discussed as possible explanations for the lack of significant results. The impact of the anger manipulation may have been to produce a sense of failure and depression rather than anger. The aggression measure may have reflected a global evaluation of the experiment and did not require aggression by the subjects. The ""neutral"" film was rated as low-key and boring and may have magnified the impact of the anger manipulation in comparison to the video game and violent film conditions. The issue of the relative importance of video games or violence on TV as precursors of real-life violence is discussed."

L., Rimpela, A.","The roles of age, social intelligence and parent-child communication in moderating the association between digital game playing and direct and indirect aggression were examined in 478 Finnish 10- and 13-year-old schoolchildren based on self-reports. The results confirmed that digital game violence was directly associated with direct aggression, especially at age 10, but only among boys. The moderating role of social intelligence was substantiated among older boys: game violence was associated with indirect aggression among those with high level of social intelligence. Further, as hypothesized, digital game playing was associated with direct aggression especially when parent-child communication was poor, but only among boys. Our findings emphasize the importance of individual and situational factors as moderators of the link between game violence and aggression."

M., Hopson, M.","Male and female adolescents served as subjects in an experiment designed to assess the relationship among personality factors, heart rate, and aggression after having played an aggressive video game. For males, personality traits and heart rate were separately related to aggression. Personality characteristics similar to those of the Type A individual were related in a positive direction to heart rate in females. The content of the video games did not affect heart rate or postgame aggression, even though females displayed greater mean heart rate than males throughout the experiment. The results are discussed with regard to sex role stereotypes, content-related explanations of aggression, and Type A personality characteristics. That teenagers may be mimicking the violence in video games was not supported."

We tested a model incorporating the related variables of impulsiveness, trait anger, and aggression and incorporated the possible mediating influences of leisure-time activities. Regression analyses of data from 1129 pre-adolescents and 1093 adolescents (55.4% females) from a study evaluating the Spanish version of the Buss and Perry aggression questionnaire (AQ; Santisteban, Alvarado, & Recio, 2007) showed a relation between impulsiveness (Barratt Impulsiveness Scale) and aggression (AQ). Trait anger (Spielberger’s State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory), the time spent watching TV and playing video games, and the time spent doing homework (all related to impulsiveness) also are related to physical, as well as verbal aggression (with low to moderate coefficients). Multiple mediation analyses confirm that media violence exposure and homework, respectively, can have aggravating and attenuating effects on self-reported aggression. These results provide key variables for longitudinal studies which could reveal the causal nature of the results found with our cross-sectional design."
