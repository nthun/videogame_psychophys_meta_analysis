AB  - Therapeutic Feedback with the MMPI-2: A Positive Psychology Approach provides the clinician with empirically based, practical information about how to convey the abundance of information in the MMPI-2 profile in a way that is collaborative, empathy, hopeful, and facilitates a therapeutic alliance. Readers will find this book to be as useful and applicable as the MMPI-2 itself, which is used in psychiatric hospitals, correctional settings, and in evaluations for job selection, general medicine, forensic and child custody cases, and even screenings for television game and reality shows. The authors expand upon this already robust test by demonstrating how therapeutic assessment and feedback can be improved upon by considering three contributions from positive psychology: 1. That behavior can be viewed as potentially adaptive; traditional pathological and maladaptive behaviors can be reframed as understandable responses to stressors. 2. That therapeutic feedback is empathy, nonjudgmental, and mostly jargon free; humans respond to overwhelming stress in understandable ways to which the therapist can give coherence and meaning. 3. That therapeutic feedback stresses self-esteem and resilience building through self-awareness as a goal. Discussion centers around 10 scales and 27 common code types. Each section addresses the complaints, thoughts, emotions, and traits and behaviors associated with the profile; therapists' notes; lifestyle and family background; modifying scales; therapy and therapeutic pitfalls; feedback statements; and treatment and self-help suggestions. The larger page size reflects the size of the MMPI-2 interpretive reports and makes it easy for clinicians to copy pages of the book to share with their clients. Therapeutic Feedback with the MMPl-2 is the most detailed volume available on MMPI-2 feedback and is a valuable addition to the bookshelf of any clinician who uses this test.

AB  - Humans are natural storytellers. Besides the survival benefit that comes with remembering and recounting past events, stories rouse our emotions. What started with the oral tradition of sitting around a fire and telling a tale has now evolved to include digital mediums. Different paradigms for conveying a story have been created with each new technological discovery, and the pace of development is getting faster. If books can be considered one-dimensional stories, the added visuals of movies could be two-dimensional stories. We argue that video games are three-dimensional because they give the player another layer of experience with the story: control. The sense of being part of the world and influencing it achieves a level of immersion that cannot be attained with traditional storytelling and ultimately evokes an emotional response unobtainable by any other means. In this chapter, we explore how video games are an interface between computers and human emotions. In a non-obvious way, gaming can alter our emotions in the long term, and they accomplish this indirectly—while we are asleep. To understand this process, a few points must first be understood about sleeping and, most importantly, dreaming. If our brains can be compared with computer systems, then our dreams are the monitors set to display a raw feed of binary data. The neural processes that occur during sleep are deeply involved with our emotions (especially our ability to regulate them) and video-gameplay undoubtedly influences them. By studying dreams, researchers are looking indirectly at one aspect of the brain’s nighttime processing and discovering the implications that video-gameplay have on our lives, dreaming, and waking.

AB  - This chapter reviews recent literature on uses, effects, and gratifications of media during emerging adulthood. The authors examine traditional media forms, including television, films, video games, music, and books, and also newer media, such as cell phones, social networking sites, and other internet use, finding that emerging adults spend more time using media than they spend doing any other activity, with most time being spent on the Internet and listening to music. They also find that exposure to certain types of media content can influence both positive and negative outcomes in emerging adulthood, including aggressive and prosocial behavior, body image, sexual behavior, friendship quality, and academic achievement. The authors show that emerging adults use media to gratify certain needs, key among them entertainment, autonomy, identity, and intimacy needs. The authors discuss areas for future research involving media and emerging adulthood. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The purpose of this chapter is to explore some of the affective affordances that video games offer within the context of language learning, particularly within the field of English as a Foreign Language (EFL), through a case study of adult life-long learners’ experiences with several popular commercial off-the-shelf video games. First, this chapter reviews some of the neuroscience evidence of emotion’s role in learning. Second, it examines video games’ multifarious effects on people and their connection to learning, as well as some of the theories about game-based learning. Third, there are details of the case study with adult life-long learners of EFL in Tokyo, Japan, examining the affective elements of a wide range of video games from different genres using both quantitative and qualitative data. Finally, there is a discussion of the findings from the case study. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This ambitious and accessible guide reviews innovative technologies enhancing the field of neuropsychological testing. Starting with the premise that standard batteries—some nearly a century old—lag behind in our era of neuroimaging, genomic studies, psychophysiology, and informatics, it presents digital measures offering more efficient administration, more accurate data, and wider clinical applications. Ecological validity and evidence-based science are key themes in these advances, from virtual environments and assessment of social cognition to the shift toward situational reliability and away from lab-created constructs. These chapters also demonstrate how high-tech assessment tools can complement or supplement traditional pencil-and-paper measures without replacing them outright. This book covers in depth: • The evolution of neuropsychological testing over the past century. • Current applications of computer-based neuropsychological assessments. • The strengths and limitations of simulation technology. • The use of tele neuropsychology in reaching remote clients. • The potential of gaming technologies in neurocognitive rehabilitation. • How technology can transform test data into information useful across specialties. Clinical Neuropsychology and Technology brings neuropsychology, clinical psychologists, and rehabilitation specialists into the vanguard of assessment measures and processes that will translate into more accurate testing, collaborations between disciplines, and valid and useful outcomes.

AB  - In this chapter, we explore how participants use nonverbal cues to express emotion and to collaborate with each other, in an online game, Way. We posit that observing how people express emotion and work together to solve problems in an online collaborative game, such as Way, can help us to better design future collaborative games. Emotion is a key component of collaboration, since individuals use emotional cues to help regulate group activity (Van Kleef, 2009), and these cues need to be supported through the design of a collaborative game or other online activity involving multiple people. Way is an online synchronous game where two players play the game, and each player controls one avatar. In the game, each player relies heavily on one another to play. Computer-mediated environments 'turn communication into substance' (Dillenbourg, 2005) by creating an artifact of the learning process, which can be reflected upon to further learning. In a sense, the cognitive load required by collaborators in a face-to-face environment is lessened, so the cognitive resources can focus on the activities that lead to reaching learning goals. In this chapter, we describe previous research related to collaboration, emotion, and nonverbal communication, particularly in online environments.

AB  - Attention, learning and emotional problems can have different causes that cannot be easily and clearly distinguished by clinical testing methods. However, QEEG and, even more so, live 19 channel Z-score training under different task conditions can both give very detailed insights about the specific functioning and dysregulations of an individual's brain. The clinical intake evaluation of the child is optimized by including a quantitative, neurometric analysis of an eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC) EEG acquisition combined with a real-time analysis of the child's (in vivo) brain functioning during a specific set of conditions. This method was developed and refined with more than 300 children who were tested between June 2012 and April 2014. The goal is to get as much information as possible in only one session lasting 45 to 60 minutes. The different parts of the evaluation consist of: eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC) collection of data, display of the actual brainwaves, listing of the Z-score values (also presented as plots or instant brain maps with different task conditions), followed by games to play with a challenge condition. In addition, current source density (CSD) sLORETA of the different wave frequencies (usually delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma bands), distribution and velocity are shown as they change, as well as when the brain evaluates emotions. The session ends with a brief, individual 19 channel training with video feedback. Because of the usefulness of the information obtained from using this QEEG method, the author recommends that QEEG and an interactive neurofeedback session be included as a standard component in the diagnosis of and treatment planning for children with attention, learning and emotional problems.

AB  - In recent years there have been tremendous advances In understanding how brain development underlies behavioral changes in adolescence. Based on the latest discoveries in the research field, Eveline A. Crone examines changes in learning, emotions, face processing and social relationships in relation to brain maturation, across the fascinating period of adolescent development. This book covers new insights from brain research that help us to understand what happens when children turn Into adolescents and then into young adults. Why do they show increases in sensation-seeking, risk-taking and sensitivity to opinions of friends? With the arrival of neuroimaging techniques, It Is now possible to unravel what goes on in an Individual's brain when completing cognitive tasks, when playing computer games, or when engaging in online social Interactions. These findings help reveal how children learn, control thoughts and actions, plan activities, control emotions and think about intentions of others, offering a new perspective on behavior and motivations of adolescents. This Is the first comprehensive book to cover the many domains of adolescent brain development, stretching from cognitive to affective to social development. It is valuable reading for students and researchers in the field of adolescent development and developmental cognitive neuroscience and those interested in how the developing brain affects behavior In the teenage years.

AB  - Organizations look for new ways of communication as traditional media is being saturated with advertising messages. One of the alternatives is product placement in video games. This chapter analyses this new communication alternative. Moreover, through an investigation the chapter shows the consequences of placing a brand in this form of electronic entertainment—in the sense of image transfer from the video game to the brand. Specifically, this chapter focuses on the emotions evoked by the video game. Therefore, the present study develops a scale of emotions adapted to the theme of this research. Additionally, this study analyses the differences between types of product placement and their effects in the image transfer. All conclusions are extracted from the concept map technique.

AB  - Video games are an interesting example of technologies/media able to generate complex emotions. Indeed, part of the emotions commonly arising in the experience of video gamers are quite negative. On the one hand, video gamers may feel frustration and anger due to the difficulty of the gameplay. On the other hand, they may experience sadness, anxiety and fear due to the immersion into emotionally rich narratives. Yet, video gamers seem to appreciate gaming technologies generating negative emotions, and the research on media frequently highlights a counterintuitive positive relation between negative affect and enjoinment/well-being outcomes. Starting from these premises, the present chapter is aimed to review the negative emotions typical of video games, in order to understand in what ways they can concur in generating an overall positive experience. Then, the chapter discusses implications for research on video games as positive technologies, namely technologies able to promote well-being in their users.

AB  - This article joins the fields of emotion recognition and human computer interaction. While much work has been done on recognizing emotions, they are hardly used to improve a user's interaction with a system. Although the fields of affective computing and especially serious games already make use of detected emotions, they tend to provide application and user specific adaptations only on the task level. We present an approach of utilizing recognized emotions to improve the interaction itself, independent of the underlying application at hand. Examining the state of the art in emotion recognition research and based on the architecture of Companion-System, a generic approach for determining the main cause of an emotion within the history of interactions is presented, allowing a specific reaction and adaption. Using such an approach could lead to systems that use emotions to improve not only the outcome of a task but the interaction itself in order to be truly individual and empathic.

AB  - Decades of research have documented associations between violent video game use and a host of negative outcomes including aggression, desensitization to violence, decreased empathy and prosocial behavior, and increased hostile attribution bias. Boys' and men's involvement in violent video gaming is pronounced and increasing. These factors, as well as the changing content of video games, present cause for concern regarding the potentially widespread impact of violent video games. The present chapter summarizes the hormonal and neurobiological aspects of aggression in males as well as the impact of violent video game use on these factors. Negative outcomes, including relational problems, impact on the children of gamers, and internet gaming disorder are considered, as are prevention and intervention efforts addressing these issues.

AB  - In this chapter, we diverge from these more traditional orientations to emotion and media research in that we begin from the assumption that media messages serve not simply as stimuli for arousing or regulating emotion, but rather they possibly play a more complex role in an audience's emotional development and social relationships than previously acknowledged. Based on the available extant evidence, we argue that emotional depictions in the media have the potential to contribute to the socialization of emotional responses, the ability to cope with negative emotions, the likelihood of experiencing the benefits of more positive mental states, and the formation of more cohesive social relationships. Despite these potential positive outcomes, there are potential pitfalls within each of these domains that are important to address. Thus, we will tackle each of these areas of what we will generally term media-based emotional coping, discussing related theory and evidence as available, and we will conclude with potential areas for future research in this domain. Throughout our discussion, we are guided by Lazarus' (1993; Lazarus and Folkman 1984) conception of emotion-focused coping as the process of managing or regulating the internal consequence of a stressor, which typically involves attempts to minimize or alleviate negative affect. Further, given the emphasis in the extant research on television and film, our review reflects this perspective; however, other chapters within this volume address emotion in other media contexts, such as video games, that are certainly relevant to the issues addressed herein.

AB  - This book brings the expertise of four child psychotherapists together for a wide-ranging and penetrating discussion of the factors that affect early development of relationships and understanding in actual therapeutic encounters which they examined together by micro-analysis of videos recording their work. They use different sciences and different metaphors to characterise their methods of therapy with children and their parents and family, but all use videos to teach their method of working with children, and all recognise the importance of the subtle micro-moments of change in the present, and the shared 'composition' of narratives of feeling and recollecting. Peter Levine is an expert on motor defence mechanisms of the body and regulation of bodily feelings of safety and risk by the autonomic system. Jukka Mäkelä applies the performance of Theraplay engagements with the child to establish trust in risk-taking games and active, rhythmic story-making. Haldor Øvreeide uses developmentally supportive dialogue and self-organising in relationships in the 'lived moment'. Eia Asen, working in London, employs 'multi-family therapy' and 'mentalization-based family therapy' to support shared rational examination of anxieties and emotional factors that limit awareness and imagination. Together, under the supportive guidance of Marianne Bentzen and Susan Hart, these four presented and discussed their work in a two day conference in Copenhagen on 'The quest for the non-specific factors in psychotherapy with children', which was transcribed, leading to a book in Danish of which this volume is the English translation.

AB  - This chapter focuses on the influence that the mass media have on viewers' emotional experiences. We will operationally define affect and emotions, explain how the mass media are related to a variety of emotional and affective experiences using evidence from primary research and theory, then describe a study in which we created a negative affective state and had participants play a violent video game to determine if video game play was related to affect and emotional repair.

AB  - Emotion has been investigated from various perspectives and across several domains within human-computer interaction (HCI) including intelligent tutoring systems, interactive web applications, social media, and human-robot interaction. One of the most promising and also challenging applications of affective computing research is within computer games. This chapter focuses on the study of emotion in the computer games domain, reviews seminal work at the crossroads of game technology, game design, and affective computing, and details the key phases for efficient affect-based interaction in games.

AB  - Physiological signals and eye signals both are novel input modalities for agent-based interfaces, which offer new opportunities for highly personalized human-computer interaction. If computers could react sensibly to users, they would provide a more positive or often less frustrating interaction experience to the user. This chapter is dedicated to investigating the potential of physiological and eye signals by describing implemented systems and studies conducted with those systems. The remainder of this chapter is organized as follows. The section 'Emotional interfaces' first reviews previous attempts to evaluate the impact of emotional agent behavior on users. Then, examples of influential emotion theories are presented - one cognitive appraisal theory and a two-dimensional emotion model. As an example, we will describe an implemented system of an emotional gaming agent and the results of an empirical study. The section 'Attentive interfaces' first explains a simple method to determine a user's visual interest. Then, an example scenario with visually perceptive presentation agents is described and evaluated. Concluding remarks round off the chapter.

AB  - This chapter gives a comprehensive state-of-the-art review on the effects that exposure to or enactment of violence in mainstream media has on aggressive behavior, emotions, and empathy. In line with contemporary technological developments, the authors also cover the more and more widespread consumption of violent video games, which put the player in a more active role than traditional media (such as television) put their viewers. As the field is extremely controversial, the authors are careful in their analysis of the actually existing evidence as well as in their conclusions and recommendations for future research. Despite all controversy, and after reviewing existing literature, as well as a large number of own empirical work, the authors come to the conclusion that there is evidence for increased aggressive motivation and impulsivity as a result of exposure to media violence, but that it is not clear yet how much it affects people's real-life behavior. Nevertheless, it is clear that there is no evidence for cathartic effects, a conclusion that is similar in research on the effects of filmed violence, and an idea that had been present in the controversy for decades but can now be abandoned.

AB  - This book chapter is dedicated to theoretical and empirical review of media among children. Empirical results about computer presence in family homes, IT literacy with different computer programmes among parents, as well children are described. In addition, attitudes of parents and preschool and school-aged children about using Internet and computer games as well as attitudes toward the Internet violence are analysed. The results of games types that children play as well as frequency of playing and children’s emotions evoked by them are shown. Finally, the results about presence of significant others as well as their conversation with children are shown. All of the above are interestingly studied in the frame of correlation analysis to research relations between some socio-demographic variables (sex, age, the level of education, and presence of computer in family home), so certain future research guidelines can be established.

AB  - This book provides an inclusive and multidisciplinary discussion of serious games that tries to provide a more holistic and coherent understanding of this emerging and fast-moving area of the educational applications of games. The aim is to try to better understand how interactive gaming technology can be utilized to enhance teaching and learning. This journey goes from the psychological theories of human behaviors, cognition, motives, and emotions that comprise the supporting body of knowledge necessary for understanding why and how serious games work to the actual application of games in real settings. While the relevance of theory and research in psychology to the design, development, and evaluation of serious games is recognized by computer scientists and technologists, it is not always clearly understood. The pedagogical principles underlying serious games are also addressed, including the role of the teachers when using games and the new educational scenarios appearing (e.g. social interactions in games). Serious games have the potential to be at their most useful in supporting higher-level skills such as critical thinking and soft skills such as interpersonal and intrapersonal skills that are very difficult to acquire with more traditional educational approaches. Moreover, in this multidisciplinary topic, it is also necessary to examine new technological developments such as the application of artificial intelligence techniques to designing non-player characters in games or the use of players’ brain signals (e.g. neurofeedback, brain computer interface) that have the potential to enhance the current applications of serious games.

AB  - In recent years, research on the psychology of gaming has examined the negative and positive outcomes of playing video games. Thus far, a variety of affective phenomena have been investigated. In this chapter we will continue this exploration by examining the emotions elicited by the act of playing video games. Because the study of emotions must rely on different type of methods, including subjective self-reports (e.g., description of feelings), neuropsychophysiological measurements (e.g. electromyography, skin conductance, heart rate, event-related potentials, functional magnetic resonance imaging), biological markers (e.g. Cortisol, testosterone) and behaviours (e.g., facial expressions), we will cover all these distinct methods. We will explore how dimensional and categorical models of emotions have been used to identify the emotional responses of players, including their enjoyment experience. Expanding upon past research findings we will also discuss the social implications of gaming and suggest areas for future research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Video games are now strongly related to the everyday life of many people; they are pervasive, ubiquitous, and no longer entertainment 'just for kids.' At the same time, a general decrease in altruism, empathy, and charity are recurrently discussed, as is the case with the increase in selfishness in our society. Interestingly, the high rates of violence in video games and its increasingly realistic portrayal have been suggested as significant factors that further contribute to these societal tendencies. The great body of studies on the negative effects of exposure to violent video games seems to substantiate these concerns. The present project scrutinizes the role of empathy in this context: Will it matter if the player takes the perspective of a video game character and understands the characters feelings and, if so, how does this affect the players feelings, thoughts, and behavior? Although empathy is a well-researched concept in the psychology of interpersonal relations, its role in media consumption and media effects has been largely overlooked. Only recently, empathy has been suggested as a potential moderating factor in understanding the effects of violent video game exposure (for example, Bartholow, Sestir, & Davis, 2005). Most other publications cover the state of the art regarding media effects, but do not extend their perspective towards other, untested factors in video game research (for example, Anderson, Gentile, & Buckley, 2007; Calvert & Wilson, 2010; Kirsh, 2012). While again, other books and journal articles focus on empathy research (Batson, 2009; Davis, 2004; Hoffman, 2000; Nathanson, 2003), no research has yet systematically investigated the function and effects of empathy in the field of media effects research. It is the aim of the present project to close this gap in the literature and provide a concise and profound analysis of the role of empathy in violent video games. Based on in-depth analyses of the literature we present three empirical studies that explore the mechanisms behind the potentially moderating functions of empathy. We show that inducing empathy before playing a violent video game affects emotion and cognition, but also prosocial and aggressive behavior. However, our results also indicate that the effects of playing violent video games do not solely depend on the game content (that is, violent versus non-violent), but also on the character played (for example, hero vs. villain), as well as the players' interpretations of the role of the character (for example, perpetrator vs. victim). Thus, the present project reveals new insights into empathy-based responses to violent media content. We argue that the distinctiveness of empathy-based reactions in the media context (both as state and trait empathy) is an important factor in various research fields of media psychology (for example, media effects, cyberbullying and media competences).

AB  - Riding the successes of the Sherlock Holmes film franchise as well as the hit BBC show Sherlock, which is a modern interpretation of the classic stories of Victorian era author and physician Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Elementary hit the North American prime time television schedule in the fall of 2012 with its own unique twists—it was to be set in New York and the character of Dr. John Watson was to be played by Lucy Liu as Dr. Joan Watson. The plot and character developments in Elementary go beyond simply playing a numbers game of representational politics. What Elementary does, and does very well, is not only ascribe intelligence to a female lead character and a woman of color but also interrogate the very concept of intelligence through the figures of Joan Watson and Sherlock Holmes, and through the gender dynamics in the personal and working relationship between them. Ultimately, Elementary challenges the gendered politics associated with cultural binaries such as intelligence/emotion, personal/professional, success/failure, and teacher/student, and in the process demonstrates that there is space for representations of intelligent and complex (racialized) women as well as for representations of intelligent and emotional men on mainstream television.

AB  - This chapter looks at the development of an emotional relationship to the player in video games; whereas this was previously attempted using noninteractive methods, the trend now is the development of interactive game characters who are behaviorally believable and are capable of responding with, for example, movement, emotion, and nonverbal cues to the actions of the player. Where games had been using passive narrative forms, similar to those used in other media such as films, the question now is what new narrative forms must be designed to account for the prototype emotive digital actors who are now appearing and what new experiences await the player.

AB  - Media scholars have begun to discuss new digital viewing contexts, such as cell phones, ipods, internet, video games, and more (see Marsha Kinder (1991) or Anne Friedberg (2006)) but few have explored processes involved in responding to images of catastrophe in a rapidly expanding visual culture. Scholars have mainly studied exhibition sites, visual techniques, ideological meanings, and how new global networks are stmctured. Response to an image is partly determined by the way it has been composed—editing, visual style, purpose—and partly by its context for exhibition, but scholars have assumed that cognition—meaning—is primary. My view is that response is also, especially in regard to images of catastrophe, emotional. We bring culturally shaped emotions to reception, and in turn, our emotions are aroused (we might say constructed) by images. For the purposes of this chapter, I will focus on empathy as an emotion central to response to images of disaster. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Officials hold a particular position in the sport settings. Often judged, sometimes criticized, rarely forgotten, referees, judges or umpires are regularly in the heart of stormy debates and provide generous inspiration of sports media. The emergence of scientific studies underlines the complexity of officiating sports. Far from usual fantasies, this chapter takes a fresh look at the reality of officials and tackles a fundamental question exceeding the frame of the sport field: decision making. If the incorrect decision, real or felt, can happen, it is always the result of a complex process involving people and systems. In this chapter, we first review the theories helping to understand how sports officials judge and decide various sport situations. We present different approaches, from nonnative to naturalistic models, which can help to understand the different challenges faced by officials. After this theoretical review, we address different factors influencing sports officials' decision making in an innovative way. Thus, the decision making of judges, referees and umpires is discussed according to three levels of analysis. First, we consider the sports official facing himself. In this part, we aim to understand that sports officials are not the cold and insensible people that we sometimes have in mind. The judgment and the decision will be influenced especially by emotions, stereotypes, experience and physical performance. Secondly, we consider the sports official within his/her environment, where we aim to understand that judging and deciding does not mean only applying the mles as a robot. Social interaction and communication, crowds, sport and financial stakes may affect the judgment of sport officials. How do officials integrate these factors into their game management? Thirdly, we consider sport officials within the evolution of sport, where we question the technical and the educative dimensions. Will video be the future official? Can officiating have an educational value? Going beyond a mere psychological perspective, this chapter will show that a multidisciplinary approach allows a better comprehension of decision making of sports officials.

AB  - Virtuality has a pedigree that predates the computer age and modern virtual worlds, a pedigree that can be traced back to classical mythology and beyond. Equally, the concept of virtuality is not the province of one field of study alone but is the foundation and driving force of many, both theoretical and applied. Our conceptualizations and applications of virtuality are multiple, as contributors demonstrate across the nine sections of this book that move from philosophy to technologies and applications before returning to philosophy again for a discussion of the Utopias and dystopias of virtuality. The almost 50 essays contained within range freely across subjects that include the potential of virtuality, ethics, virtuality and self, presence and immersion, virtual emotions, image, sound and literature, computer games, AI and A-life, augmented reality and real virtuality, law and economics, medical and military applications, religion, and cybersex. Throughout, contributors discuss differences between virtuality, reality, and actuality in debates filtered through the lenses of the disciplines represented here, and they speculate on future directions. It is not at all clear that there are differences; if such distinctions are to be found, the boundaries between virtuality, reality, and actuality continually shift as ideas, modes of organization, and behaviors constantly flow from one to the other regardless of direction. The Handbook presents no unified definition of virtuality to comfort the reader, rather a multiplicity of questions and approaches underpinned by provocative statements that should further fuel the debates surrounding our notions of virtuality.

AB  - Stripping away the hype, this book describes how, when, and why media violence can influence children of different ages, giving parents and teachers the power to maximize the media's benefits and minimize its harm. There are many opinions about media violence and children, but not all are supported by science. In this book, the top experts gather the latest results from 50 years of scientific study as the basis for a comprehensive, in-depth examination of the complex issues surrounding the effects of media violence of different types. Each chapter focuses on a particular issue of concern, including 'hot' topics such as brain development, cyber-bullying, video games, and verbal aggression. Articles take into account factors such as economics, differences based on the ages of children, and differences between types of media violence. This book provides the information parents and those who work with families need to make the best choices. It includes chapters specifically relevant to the types of bullying schools have the most trouble identifying and controlling. Most importantly, the writing is both intelligent and accessible so that parents, educators, pediatricians, and policymakers can understand and apply the findings presented. Features of the volume are as follows: Includes the newest research on topics of particular concern today, including cyber-bullying, video games, song lyrics, and brain development; Covers all major media, including television, movies, music, video games, and the Internet; Describes the psychological processes through which media violence influences attitudes, emotions, and behaviors; Provides the context necessary to understand why media violence does not affect everyone the same way; and Discusses how media violence intersects with public policy, identifies the problems with the existing rating systems, and suggests strategies to improve the situation and foster children's healthy development.

AB  - Although the literature on the psychophysiology of media violence remains quite small, recent work paints something of a mixed picture in terms of potentially beneficial and harmful effects of exposure. Recent ERP and fMRI evidence suggests that both acute and repeated exposure to violent video games is associated with decreases in activation of neural circuits underlying some forms of cognitive, affective, and behavioral control, which can negatively influence the ability to regulate aggressive thoughts and behaviors. In other words, the brain’s capacity for responding appropriately to violence-related stimuli may be compromised by media violence exposure, leading to inappropriate (i.e., apathetic) or detrimental (i.e., hostile) behavior when confronted with violence in the real world, or with situations that require inhibition of aggressive impulses. Desensitization reduces healthy, empathetic responses to violent stimuli, which has implications for ensuring the well-being of others in a number of contexts, including those that do not involve violence. Decreased neural control over thoughts and behavior increases the likelihood of rash, aggressive actions, especially in response to provocation. This pathway from brain to behavior, revealed by neuroimaging methods, identifies how media violence exerts its effects on aggressive thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Future work should be directed at not only continuing to document such effects and their limitations but also to characterizing how these effects may have a long-term impact on brain structure and function. Combining multiple neuroimaging paradigms with behavioral and psychological investigations will help us better understand the mechanisms by which playing violent video games influences neurocognitive processes underlying desensitization and inhibitory control, as well as the implications of such effects for regulating social behaviors, such as aggression.

AB  - The goal of this chapter is to present an up-to-date review of emotion assessment methods in computer-based systems and recent research on how these methods have been used in games. The primary focus of this chapter is on emotion assessment in educational games. However, since research on affective educational games is quite limited to date, the authors discuss emotion assessment methods employed in entertainment games as well, and the transferability of these methods to an educational context. The authors describe three emotion-recognition approaches used in affective computing, including detailed descriptions of various emotion assessment methods used within each approach, their strengths, and their limitations. Next, they discuss recent empirical research on emotions assessment in entertainment and educational games, followed by a summary and a discussion addressing challenges in assessing emotions and development of user affect recognition computer-based systems. Finally, the authors conclude with suggestions for future research on assessment of emotions in educational games. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - After what I thought was a very successful two-year treatment of a nine-year-old boy I will call Jack, his single mother said she could not afford to continue and abruptly ended the therapy. Jack himself wanted more. A year later, I learned from the newspaper that another boy in a video game parlor had murdered him. Recently, I passed the building where he lived and felt a deep sadness. I hope to convey the various ways I have dealt with my grief for this child and the consequence of having failed to mourn him adequately for the two decades since his death. In the process of writing this paper and beginning to mourn more fully the loss of Jack and its connection to other losses, I began to reflect on the various defenses against awareness of the finality of death. I believe that this is what I can add to our psychoanalytic understanding of mourning. At least, it is what I have learned in the process of thinking about the issues raised by my patient's death and the inhibition of my own functioning as a reaction to that loss. Authentic mourning can occur when the mind is not preoccupied with defensive thoughts. Then it can proceed at a tolerable pace, without devastating the mourner with overwhelming grief that could interfere with functioning. Rather than viewing mourning as a process of moving through the defined stages of denial, rage, sadness, and acceptance, all of these emotions are experienced in doses, separated by periods of functioning in the world. When any of these emotions are too intense or last too long, they exhaust the mourner and give way to another emotion. How do these defenses work? In the following sections, I will examine each of these defenses and how they illuminate our understanding of the ways we protect ourselves from confronting death.

AB  - A more integrated conceptualization of processes of feeling and meaning-making is needed if we are to understand their joint role in learning. In settings where the consequences of each successive action are amplified by the responses of social partners or computer programs, longer-term trajectories of learning become more unpredictable and the role of feeling, affect, and emotion in co-determining them becomes more evident. From computer games to play and learning in an informal after-school program, a more integrated view of feeling and meaning offers both better opportunities for understanding and greater challenges for researchers. Feelings need to be reconceived as more active, interactive, distributed, situated, culture- and event specific, and functioning on and across multiple time scales, just as we have similarly re-conceptualized meaning-making processes in recent years. Learning can no longer be defined as progress relative to fixed criteria when goals are not externally determined and activity trajectories are relatively unpredictable; such naturalistic learning needs to be identified retrospectively from actual outcomes and assessed by cultural value judgments. I offer both a more unified theoretical model of meaning-and-feeling and accounts of research settings in which unpredictable learning is always occurring, but is also always subordinate to play, playfulness, and having fun. In these feeling rich, free-choice settings, so unlike the afflictively constrained, over-controlled conditions of classrooms and occasions of formal learning, we discover challenging opportunities to study the ways in which the minute-to-minute and month-to month integration of social-affective feelings and semiotic meaning-making both do and do not cumulate into what we may retrospectively decide to call learning for the individual and for the group.

AB  - Technological devices have become more affordable, multifunctional, and portable over recent years. Not only have the number of devices increased in families' households, but also increasingly more evidence documents that children and adolescents keep these devices in their bedrooms. On a related note, the percentage of youth who use technology before bed is remarkably high, and emerging evidence shows technology is now being used during the night. This chapter reviews the effects of various technological devices (TVs, computers/internet, video games, cell phones, music players) on the sleep of children and adolescents. Possible mechanisms explaining these effects (including displacing bedtime, arousal, light and electromagnetic transmission, and nighttime sleep disruption) : are discussed, as well as potential modifying factors of age, gender, socioeconomic status, and parental involvement. Directions for future research and recommendations for families and health professionals are provided in order to continue to improve the sleep hygiene of our youth.

AB  - It is indisputable that media is by far the most common means by which human beings spend our free time in the modern world. However, the ubiquity of media in our lives brings with it advantages and disadvantages along with uncertainty: will increased dependence on media impair our social functioning, enhance it, or both? The Oxford Handbook of Media Psychology explores myriad facets of human behavior, thoughts, and feelings experienced in the context of media use and creation. Divided into six sections, chapters in this volume trace the history of media psychology; address content areas for media research, including children's media use, media violence and desensitization, sexual content, video game violence, and portrayals of race and gender; and cover psychological and physical effects of media such as serious games, games for health, technology addictions, and video games and attention. A section on meta-issues in media psychology brings together transportation theory, media psychophysiology, social influence in virtual worlds, and learning through persuasion. Other topics include the politics of media psychology, a lively debate about the future of media psychology methods, and the challenges and opportunities present in this interdisciplinary field.

AB  - The widespread consumption of video games has led social commentators and scientists to question the effects of this medium on the human experience. Within the social and cognitive sciences, investigators have devoted considerable energy to characterizing the effects of video game experience on cognitive and social information processing and behavior (Anderson et al., 2010; Green, Li, & Bavelier, 2010). This chapter considers the emerging literature demonstrating a relationship between video game experience and clinical attention deficits, and provides an integrative review of the literature related to the association between video game experience and attention within three domains (visuospatial processing, executive function, and emotion). This literature reveals that video game experience can both enhance and disrupt various aspects of attention related to these aspects of mental life. Building on existing evidence, future research should seek to identify the boundary conditions under which effects of video game experience are observed and determine the effects of this medium on attention in natural settings.

AB  - This chapter introduces Machine Consciousness as a new research field applied to the development of human-like behaviour of non-player characters (NPCs) in video games. Key aspects, advantages, and challenges of this young research area are discussed using the cognitive architecture CERA-CRANIUM as an illustrative example of an autonomous control system inspired by cognitive theories of human consciousness. Additionally, other cognitive architectures used in video games are also analyzed. The bot codenamed CC-Bot2, winner of the 2K BotPrize 2010 competition and based on the CERA-CRANIUM cognitive architecture, is also described in this chapter Specifically, the particular way in which CC-Bot2 processes the sensory-motor information and generates sequences of adaptive human-like actions is discussed. We also analyze the main differences between CC-Bot2 and other bots, focusing on the key features that allowed CC-Bot2 to win first place in the competition. Finally, we conclude by describing the main lines of work for future CC-Bot implementations and pointing out major conclusions about the application of Machine Consciousness to the design of believable bots.

AB  - Affective bio-feedback can be an important instrument to enhance the game experience. Several studies have provided evidence of the usefulness of physiological signals for affective gaming; however, due to the limited knowledge about the distinctive autonomic signatures for every emotion, the pattern matching models employed are limited in the number of emotions they are able to classify. This paper presents a bio-affective gaming interface (BAGI) that can be used to customize a game experience according to the player’s emotional response. Its architecture offers important characteristics for gaming that are important because they make possible the reusability of previous findings and the inclusion of new models to the system. In order to prove the effectiveness of BAGI, two different types of neural networks have been trained to recognize emotions. They were incorporated into the system to customize, in real-time, the computer wallpaper according to the emotion experienced by the user. Best results were obtained with a probabilistic neural network with accuracy results of 84.46% on the training data and 78.38% on the validation for new independent data sets.

AB  - Sports are ubiquitous in human cultures and are valued as a form of physical competition (Chick and Loy 2001; Llaurens et al. 2009a). At the same time, watching sport is a pastime that captivates viewers across the world, with major sporting events such as the FIFA World Cup or Olympic Games attracting audiences of hundreds of millions, both as live spectators, and as television, Internet, and radio viewers or listeners. The worldwide appeal of sports such as football has led economists and psychologists to devote an increasing body of research to this global phenomenon (Kocher and Sutter 2010). Recently, there has also been a dramatic increase in research examining sport from an evolutionary perspective. This chapter describes research into evolutionary aspects of human behavior in sports, illustrating how evolutionary insights have been applied and have enriched our understanding of human sports and competition, and points to promising ideas for further study. We focus on four issues that have received recent attention. First, we describe the relationship between testosterone levels and sporting outcomes and how they play an important role in the phenomenon of home advantage. Second, we explore the issue of home advantage and its psychological and hormonal mediators in more detail. Third, we elucidate possible explanations for why left-handedness may be advantageous in physical combats in westernized but also traditional societies. Finally, we describe and assess influences of color on human and animal agonistic behavior. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - We share our modern world with bots—chatbots to converse with, roombots to clean our houses, spambots to fill our e-mail inboxes, and medibots to assist our surgeons. This book is about computer game bots, virtual companions who accompany us in virtual worlds or sharpen our fighting skills. These bots must be believable, that is human players should believe they arc interacting with entities operating at a human level—bots are more fun if they behave like we do. This book shows how to create believable bots that play computer games, and it discusses the implications of making them appear human. The chapters in this book present the stale of the art in research on and development of game bots, and they also look beyond the design aspects to address deep questions: Is a bot that plays like a person intelligent? Does it have emotions? Is it conscious? The topic is inherently interdisciplinary, and the work draws from research and practice in many fields, such as design, creativity, entertainment, and graphics; learning, psychology, and sociology; artificial intelligence, embodiment, agents, machine learning, robotics, human-computer interaction, and artificial life; cognition and neuroscience; and evolutionary computing. The contributing authors are among the leading researchers and developers in this field, and most of the examples and case studies involve analysis of commercial products. The book will be of value lo graduate students and academic researchers in artificial intelligence, and to engineers charged with the design of entertaining games.

AB  - Background: Damasio and Bechara et al. suggested somatic marker hypothesis (SMH) that under uncertainty, the intact emotion system can facilitate the rational decision in the long run. Most healthy decision-makers have the foresighted choice pattem. Namely, healthy subjects prefer advantageous decks to disadvantageous decks after the second block (about trials 21-40) in the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) (Damasio, 1994; Bechara et al., 1999). Conversely, the patients with ventromedial prefrontal lesions possess the myopic decision pattern. However, an increasing number of studies have identified the prominent deck B (PDB) phenomenon, indicating that normal decision-makers have myopic choice behavior in the IGT. Normal subjects have difficulty avoiding disadvantageous deck B, even when near game end. Nevertheless, most IGT-related studies, including those of the Iowa group, subtracted bad decks from good decks (the two-category format) when presenting experimental data. Consequently, the incidence of the PDB phenomenon was not accurately assessed. Here we provided an empirical study which contains a complex and simple version of IGT to illustrate the PDB phenomenon. Methods: Two computer versions of IGT (concurrent (cIGT) vs. net-value (nIGT) are utilized to determine whether healthy decision-makers start shifting their preference from bad decks to good decks after the second block (about trials 21-40). In total, 48 gender-balanced subjects participated in this experiment. Each subject played only the cIGT or the nIGT. In total, 300 trials for each IGT version were utilized to identify the extended preferences of subjects. Results: A few studies presented data acquired using the four-deck format, providing clear experimental results for each deck that verify that the PDB phenomenon exists. Additionally, empirical results obtained by this study indicate that the two-category format identified a turning point for preferences during the second block (about trials 21-40) in both IGT versions. However, the PDB phenomenon existed in most stages of both IGT versions; namely, most healthy decision-makers avoided bad deck A, and had difficultly avoiding bad deck B. Conclusions: The present research indicates that the PDB phenomenon probably exists in most IGT related studies. Different presentation methods (two categories vs. four decks) can result in entirely different explanations of IGT decision behavior. Empirical data demonstrate that in both IGT versions, the PDB phenomenon existed, (Lin et al., 2007), which is counter to the basic IGT assumption that decks are chosen based on long-term outcome, even under an extended number of trials. This empirical finding indicates that players have a myopic view of long-term outcome in the IGT. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In many recent computer games there has been an increased use of Non-Player Characters as quest givers, tradesmen, members of the general public and as quest companions for the players. All these roles call for intelligent bots that can give the player an engaging experience by adjusting and adapting to the players' style of play. They need to behave as actors in a virtual improvisational theatre. They need to perform in a manner that the player finds believable and engaging so that the player becomes sufficiently immersed in the interactive drama and keeps coming back for more. The bot's intelligence needs to be both robust to respond to player actions and sufficiently complex to handle character traits, emotions and complex decision making that resembles that of a human player. A balance needs to be maintained between the bots' believability and their entertainment value for the player, as these two goals may be at odds in some situations.

AB  - Video-games, like movies, music and storybooks are emotional artifacts. We buy media to alter our affective state. Through consumption they impact our physiology and thus alter our affective world. In this chapter the authors review the ways in which playing games can elicit emotion. This chapter will discuss the increased power of video-game technology to elicit affect, and show how the mash-up of traditional and interactive techniques have delivered a richness of emotion that competes with film and television. They then conclude by looking forward to a time when video-games become the dominant medium, and the preferred choice when seeking that emotional fix.

AB  - This chapter first reviews literature examining the effects of video games from the perspective of social, cognitive, affective, and education science. It also considers how knowledge from social and cognitive neuroscience may serve to enhance our understanding of the effects of video game experience. The literature reveals some paradoxical effects wherein experience with the same types of games can lead to an increase in aggression, a decrease in cognitive control, and an increase in visuospatial abilities.A consideration of the behavioral, neuroanatomical, and physiological bases of the effects of video games leads to the suggestion that exposure to these media is associated with plasticity within neural networks supporting high level vision, emotion processing, cognitive control, and social decision making. Future investigations focusing on within and between domain comparisons using behavioral and neuromonitoring techniques are likely to provide greater insight into neural basis of the effects of video games.

AB  - Video games have come a long way, from Atari's pinging, monochromatic Pong to the garish mayhem of Grand Theft Auto and the stylish sophistication of The Beatles: Rock Band. And it's no longer just teenagers that are hooked—audiences both young and old can't seem to get enough. But while 'video-game addict' has become a common term, are these games really physically and psychologically addictive? With video game sales in the billions and anxious concerns about their long-term effects growing louder, Glued to Games: How Video Games Draw Us In and Hold Us Spellbound brings something new to the discussion. It is the first truly balanced research-based analysis on the games and gamers, addressing both the positive and negative aspects of habitual playing by drawing on significant recent studies and established motivational theory. Filled with examples from popular games and the real experiences of gamers themselves, Glued to Games gets to the heart of gaming's powerful psychological and emotional allure—the benefits as well as the dangers. It gives everyone from researchers to parents to gamers themselves a clearer understanding of the psychology of gaming, while offering prescriptions for healthier, more enjoyable games and gaming experiences.

AB  - In this chapter, the authors create a theoretical model to analyze the challenges inherent in the implementation of moral choices in single-player avatar-based video game. Based on previous research in moral psychology and game studies, the authors investigate the relationship between the player’s moral emotions and the events she causes to happen in the fictional world of a video game. The authors find that there are two factors that govern the identification with the moral content of the game’s fiction: the implementation of moral agency into the game, of which they identify two basic scenarios (fixed justice and accumulation of deeds), and the style of gameplay the player chooses to follow. The authors give numerous examples from interviews, on-line discussions and gaming press of instances when players feel moral emotions about im(moral) actions they have taken in a video game.

AB  - Gentile and Anderson believe the research has made it clear that playing violent videogames leads to violent behavior. These researchers claim that several things happen when a child is playing violent games: an increase in physiological arousal, aggressive cognitions and emotions, aggressive behaviors, and decreased pro-social behaviors. These researchers also take on some of the more popular criticisms facing video game research, such as the claim that violent video games only affect those who are already abnormally aggressive. Gentile and Anderson argue that this criticism is not valid because no group has ever been discovered to be totally immune from the effects of violent video games. Olson asserts that there is not a causal connection between violent video games and violent behavior. In the second article, she summarizes several of her relevant research studies, including multiple qualitative and quantitative projects, a survey of over 1,000 middle school-aged children, and in-depth conversations with 42 youths in focus groups. While she allows that some individuals may have bad experiences with video games, she reports that playing such games, even violent ones, is a normal part of adolescent development. Indeed, they may even have pro-social and relationship-building consequences (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This chapter addresses the integration of digital technologies with art therapy and psychodynamic practice. A case study that focuses on an adolescent male in foster care demonstrates how video game playing may be used to promote the developmental task of mastering emotions, and how the electronic screen may function as a therapeutic mirror. Three-dimensional (3-D) computer animation is shown to be a compelling artistic medium with the potential to engage adolescents during treatment. The creation of a video game scenario is discussed in relation to established art therapy methods using projection and metaphor. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - As with every new medium, from the production of print cartoons to computer games, the Internet is frequently seen as causal of harm. News about the Net features regularly in the mainstream media of newspapers and television, very often negatively associated with crime and harm. Such concerns evolved as the Internet spread. Once commercialised in the early 1990s, fears about its potential for crime, deviance and harm grew as rapidly as the new cyber-communications systems themselves. Alongside such fears, calls for censorship, control and monitoring led to a whole range of interventions by states, police, service providers, business, lobby groups and vigilantes. This chapter considers whether such calls for control should take precedence over the freedom of expression that has characterised the 'consensual hallucination' of cyberspace since its creation. This chapter will consider whether any lethal potential of cyberspace should take precedence over the importance of freedom of expression for truth, democracy and individual autonomy. The focus therefore is evidence of suicide and homicide where media accounts clearly attribute blame on cyberspace for extreme, actual identifiable harm and whether such cases justify the censorship of communications' freedom.

AB  - The development of more meaningful video games is becoming increasingly possible by recent advances in video game technologies, neurosciences, and biofeedback. In the near future, meaningful video games will be designed to facilitate personal-psychological transformation. Unlike 'serious games' that focus on education and 'conditioning' the mind, meaningful games will cultivate emotional intelligence, somatic awareness, and archetypal integration in order to 'un-condition' the mind and thereby facilitate psychologically meaningful personal transformations. Meaningful game research will access the dynamics of psychological transformation in order to enhance archetypal awareness, intuition, and insight on the part of players. Within the genre of meaningful video games, Drama-Based Games (DBG) add an unprecedented dimension for psychological engagement and decision-making. Because they extend psychological player immersion to the dimension of 'physical' interactivity, (DBG) incorporate the full range of psychological functions defined by Carl Jung. Because psychological experiences are correlated with physiological processes, DBG may be used as research instruments for quantifying diverse biometric-psychological interactions that occur during game play. Advances in electronics now enable the real-time and non-intrusive capturing of physiological data such as brain waves (e.g., electroencephalography), heart-rate variability, skin response, and facial expression. This data can provide an objective basis for measuring dimensions of the cognitive unconscious in test subjects as they respond to game experiences. The ultimate goal of research is to provide veridical data relative to the psychological parameters of an increasingly mediated global environment—a Psychecology—and to study the ensuing world-view.

AB  - There is little research into the emotional dimension of creative industry personnel, such as computer game designers, and how emotions relate to their creative practices and work-related events. Such socioemotional work is the focus of this chapter. There is a practice-centered relevance to this topic too – it is reported that there exists a poor quality of life in many global game studios. Given our deficient knowledge of emotions in computer game development, and the practical resonance of this topic, our key research question is: What emotions, creative practices and work-related events characterize emotional journeys in computer game design teams, and how do these characteristics inter-relate? To explore and answer this research question, we draw on an in-depth field study of a computer games studio in Singapore. The chapter offers a theory of emotion-mediated improvisation as a coping model for the tumultuous emotional journeys that game developers endure.

AB  - There is mounting evidence on the effects of media on antisocial and aggressive behaviour. This chapter reviews current research on. the topic, which has focused on how media violence effects on arousal, affect, cognition and behaviour. Most evidence comes from television and video games research and the differential effects of these two types of media on the individual are examined. Additional evidence from studies on the Internet effects and music and lyrics is also provided. The main short and long-term effects of media violence are also discussed, suggesting different explanatory models. Another important distinction examined relates to the types of violence displayed on the media. Most of the effects of media violence relate to the development, over-learning and reinforcement of aggression-related knowledge structures, including hostile attribution bias, aggressive actions against others, expectations of violence, positive attitudes towards violence, the belief that violence is acceptable and appropriate to solve problems, and desensitization. Although aggressive and antisocial behavior is affected by media violence, there is also evidence that a raw amount of media use, regardless of its violent content, has an impact on behavior. The social perspective of the individual mediates the relation between raw media use and behavior. This is explained in terms of the lack of role-taking opportunities that media provide, compared to other sources of socialization. The inability to adopt another's perspective and the lack of opportunities for cognitive de-centering and the reduction of egocentric bias limit the adolescent's capacity to calculate the consequences of own behavior. It also limits his/her understanding of the needs, feelings, desires, purposes, and worries of other people. Individuals in this situation would be unable to grasp the most direct consequences of their behavior and, consequently, would be more likely to engage in antisocial conducts.

AB  - Empathy is related to a variety of prosocial behaviors, but the brain mechanisms producing the experience of empathy have not been fully characterized. This study investigated whether the experience of empathy raises oxytocin levels and affects subsequent generosity toward strangers. Short video clips of an emotional scene and an unemotional scene were used as stimuli. Participants rated the emotions they experienced and then played a $40 ultimatum game to gauge their generosity. We found that empathy was associated with a 47% increase in oxytocin from baseline. We also found the empathy-oxytocin response was stronger in women than in men. Higher levels of empathy were also associated with more generous monetary offers toward strangers in the ultimatum game. Our findings provide the first evidence that oxytocin is a physiologic signature for empathy and that empathy mediates generosity. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Moving pictures are (in tandem with video games and certain virtual reality applications) the most sophisticated simulation of human experience by the interaction of the embodied brain and the world (see Anderson, 1996). This complexity demands and makes possible a series of higher-order integrative processes to make a unified aesthetic experience out of these different fields. The most important tools of integration are narrative, emotions, and feelings. Topics discussed in this chapter include film experience and brain architecture; storytelling and primitive self-emotions; the PECMA flow and visual aesthetics of mental life; the brain's reality status, evaluations, and film; and brain architecture and film aesthetics.

AB  - Cyberpsychology is about humans and computers and the psychology of how they interact. Computers permeate nearly every human activity in the modern world and affect human behavior from the most basic sensory-motor interactions to the most complex cognitive and social processes. This book begins with a brief history of psychology and computers and a comparison of the human nervous system and the circuitry of a computer. A number of theories and models of human-computer interaction are presented, as well as research methods and techniques for usability testing. Following the typical contents of an introduction to psychology, the book then discusses sensation and perception, learning and memory, thinking and problem solving, language processing, individual differences, motivation and emotion, social relations, and abnormal behavior as they impact the human-computer interface. Finally, specific issues of artificial intelligence, assistive technologies, video games, and electronic education are presented. Cyberpsychology is the new psychology.

AB  - The effects of playing computer games on children has become an important issue in psychological research in the last couple of years. The question of whether playing computer games leads to increased aggression, particularly among those playing violent games excessively, has stimulated numerous studies. Currently, the meta-analytic findings seem to imply that being exposed to violent games increases aggressive behavior, aggressive cognition, aggressive affect, and physiological arousal as well as it decreases helping behavior on average. Nevertheless, from a meta-analytical point of view, each effect size is subject to errors of unknown magnitude, and these errors can only be overcome by aggregation of similar studies, yielding more reliable estimates of effect sizes. It is not surprising that some researchers question that violent video games have detrimental effects in real life contexts--either on the basis of single-study results or on the grounds of legitimate arguments. In this chapter, we emphasize another important issue when encountering weak or null effects in aggression-related studies: the methods used when assessing aggressiveness and aggressive behaviors. More precisely, it is a well-known problem that self-reports on socially sensitive topics (such as aggressive thoughts, aggressive feelings, and aggressive behavior) can be biased and, thus, lead to inconsistent results. Within this contribution we argue that these self-reported variables, i.e., explicit measures, might meaningfully be complemented by newly developed methods, so-called implicit measures, that aim at assessing automatic affect and cognition. Although there are still many methodological problems to overcome, implicit measures have already added to our knowledge of preactivation of emotional and cognitive content in social encounters. In the following, we will (a) highlight advantages of implicit measures, (b) suggest that aggression research might profit from measuring (automatic) affective reactions and predicting (spontaneous) behaviors, (c) describe the general procedure of aggression-related Implicit Association Tests (lATs), (d) and show how these automatic cognitive-affective processes can be integrated into current models of aggressive emotions and aggressive reactions. Finally, we will report our own findings that used implicit measures to explore the consequences of playing violent computer games with regard to the automatic self-concept and attitudes toward aggressive behavior among young adults and school children.

AB  - Examines the issue of expressive behavior in 3D graphical characters in motion. The authors explore a computer graphics approach in which the posture and stance required for an action can be modified by the affective state of the character to produce expressive behavior in real time. This approach combines neutral animations, stance composition and changes in the speed and amplitude of the animation to create different affective scripts, and can be used in different characters from both humanoid and non-humanoid skeletons. Examples of such scripts are provided in the context of the computer game Fantasy A, a magic duel in which characters fight each other using spells. Unlike other computer games, the user does not decide which magic spell to use but influences the emotional state of the character, and this chooses spells autonomously. To be able to play, the user must thus recognize the emotional states of the characters. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Computer animated characters come in many different forms. Film characters require a substantial amount of off-line animator effort to achieve high levels of quality; these techniques are not suitable for real time applications and are not the focus of this chapter. Non-player characters (typically the bad guys) in games use limited artificial intelligence to react autonomously to events in real time. However, avatars are completely controlled by their users, reacting to events solely through user commands. This chapter will discuss the distinction between fully autonomous characters and completely controlled avatars and how the current differentiation may no longer be useful, given that avatar technology may need to include more autonomy to live up to the demands of mass appeal. We will firstly discuss the two categories and present reasons to combine them. We will then describe previous work in this area and finally present our own framework for semi-autonomous avatars.

AB  - 'Playing computer videogames can be just what you need to get a job.' Could such a statement ever be true? Computer games, software, and networking technologies are often viewed as threats to the social, emotional, and physical well-being and development of children. However, such beliefs are often unfounded. This new collection of research presents a range of research on topics from the impact of ultra-violent videogames on children and youth who participate in entertainment violence, to the benefits these technologies have to offer. Videogames, computers, and the Internet can provide opportunities for problem solving, creativity, and autonomy; in particular, carefully constructed software can provide an alternative to traditional classroom learning. This book is one of the first books to examine the impact of computers in both formal or school learning environments and informal learning contexts. It presents ideas from international scholars on the impact of computers, the Internet, and videogames on children's learning, as well as the social and cultural issues that affect technology use.

AB  - In this book Roger Levesque focuses on the impact of media on adolescents. As he notes in his introductory chapter, today's adolescents are inundated with a wide variety of media, more so than any prior generation. Television, video games, movies, Internet, and MP3 players play an increasing dominant role in the lives of many youth. Unlike prior generations, adolescents are considerably more autonomous, typically interacting with the media with little or no adult supervision. Media clearly play an important role in shaping adolescent identity, behavior, and health. Levesque's perspective is that the media can have both positive and negative effects on adolescent behavior and he is interested in understanding these effects in the context of adolescent development. He cautions us to not view the relationship of media and adolescent development in a narrow and simplistic manner. Indeed, while he acknowledges that the research on media effects has provided useful information about its impact, he is clear that the research falls short in aiding our understanding of the multiple factors that shape adolescent development. Professor Levesque notes that the media's impact on prosocial behavior may be more powerful than its negative impact. Unfortunately, a substantial amount of the research focuses on the negative effects. He presents concise, clear summaries of what the research tells us about the impact of the media in four areas: violence, body images, smoking, and sexuality. He identifies gaps in our knowledge and provides directions for future research. He points to many contradictory findings and notes that we have insufficient information about long-term effects. His conclusion that there is evidence of negative effects in each of these areas will not be surprising to most. This review of research is important in that it supports the conclusion that society should be concerned about the impact of media on adolescent development. It provides the basis for his analysis of how society should respond to this concern. He notes that the dominant response has been censorship to restrict access of adolescents to certain media. Parents are, of course, expected to be the primary mechanism for restricting access. As Levesque points out, this may be viable with young children but generally fails with adolescents. Following a stimulating and thoughtful discussion of free speech rights, he concludes that the current legal approaches to limit adolescent rights also fail to address the concerns, and he concludes that the legal system's adult-centered approach has negatively impacted the constitutional rights of adolescents. Levesque proposes a creative alternative, one that would not restrict adolescent access but rather would foster self-governance and increased civic participation. Rather than focusing on media as a source of negative influence, his approach seeks to promote the development of competency through access to information. His analysis and recommendations will be of interest to adolescents, parents, teachers, school administrators, community leaders, and policy makers, and I expect they will provide the foundation for stimulating and valuable discussion about the role of media in our society.

AB  - There is now a growing body of evidence detailing how people use different forms of media, and how the media--primarily television, films, and video games--are likely to affect them. Much of this research shows that children of different ages use and are affected by the media differently (Dorr, 1986; Kundanis, 2003; Van Evra, 2004). Theories of developmental psychology can help us interpret this evidence by identifying the potential mechanisms explaining why those effects may occur, and by guiding our predictions about which children are most at risk for specific effects. They also help to explain how children make sense of media content, and how their understanding of the media changes with age. Finally, in the absence of a credible mechanism or theoretical explanation for how two variables are related, developmental theories can help to separate real causal relationships from spurious ones. Generally speaking, developmental theories can be organized into three main categories: those that emphasize the development of acquired behaviors, those that emphasize the development of cognition (that is, attention, learning, memory, understanding, and judgments), and those that emphasize the development of personality and emotions (including the psychoanalytic theories of Freud and Erikson). Other theories that are typically part of a developmental approach include neurobiology theories (emphasizing brain functioning and responses), and ecological theories (emphasizing the multiple and interactive environments in which a child develops and functions). Which theoretical approach you use to explain a given set of data or observations depends partly on your own view of human development and partly on the nature of the question under consideration. Theories differ in their emphasis on cognition, for example. If you are interested in how children understand (or misunderstand) what they see on television, then all of the cognitive theories will be very applicable to that question; many other theories (for example, behaviorism or Freud's psychosexual theory) have little to say about thinking or understanding. In addition, some developmental theories describe qualitative changes that occur during specific and predictable stages of development (for example, Piaget's theory), whereas others portray a more gradual process of changes that occur with age (for example, social learning and information-processing theories). Finally, some theories emphasize the importance of innate, biological, or unconscious influences ('nature'), while others stress the importance of environmental influences ('nurture'); the latter are more useful for studying children and media.

AB  - Today's society is inundated with many types of violence, devastation, disaster, trauma, war, and death. Children are exposed to violence and injury, both real and enacted, via television, news, movies, and other media (e.g., video games). Children may also experience violence and death in the home through abuse, illness, and accidents. These painful experiences may also confront children in school--the special arena of children. When a death occurs in a child's home, the painful experience is taken into the school. On not-so-rare occasions, accidents, illness, violence, and even death occur in classrooms and common areas. A look at the media reveals a long list of school shootings, such as those that occurred in the Cleveland Elementary School in San Diego, California; Bethel Regional High School, in Bethel, Alaska; and Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado. And even deaths from apparently natural causes may occur at school--as in the case of 5-year-old Jasmine Man, who fell unconscious after eating lunch at 1:30 P.M. at P.S. 184 in Manhattan, was rushed to the hospital, and was 'pronounced dead at 2:05 P.M.'. When death invades the school and is experienced firsthand, it becomes harder to deal with, because it is real and personal. It is not happening in a movie where the actor comes back the following week healthy and whole, giving an interview; it is not occurring halfway around the world; and it is not happening to a cartoon character. It is real. This chapter focuses on the elementary school environment and on how death directly touches children at this age level. How do the school personnel deal with death? For example, how do they involve themselves with the unresolved emotions of a child who has lost a sibling? How can school administrators help comfort the child and his or her classmates, and give guidance to teachers and parents? If the death is that of a teacher, how are the children in his or her class(es) in particular, and the school in general, informed and cared for? What resources and methods are available to restore routine and a sense of security? Schools are generally thought of as places of safety. Five days a week, parents willingly leave their children in the care of trusted and competent professionals. In a figurative sense, at least, the school acts in loco parentis during this time; that is, it takes the place of the parents. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Three experimental studies, one correlational study, and a meta-analysis tested key hypotheses concerning the short-term and long-term impact of exposure to violent video games. Experiment 1 found that violent video games in general increase the accessibility of aggressive thoughts. Experiments 2 and 3 found that playing violent video games increased aggression, even when arousal and affect were controlled. Experiments 2 and 3 also found that trait hostility and trait aggression were positively related to laboratory aggression. Furthermore, there was correlational evidence of a link between repeated exposure to violent video games and trait aggressiveness. Mediational analyses suggested that the trait effects and the violent video game effects on laboratory aggression were partially mediated by revenge motivation. The correlational study uncovered links between habitual exposure to violent video games, persistent aggressive cognitions, and self-reported aggressive behavior. A destructive testing regression approach found that the video game violence/aggression link remained significant even after stressing the link by partialling out sex, narcissism, emotional susceptibility, and Big Five personality factors. However, consistent with prior empirical and theoretical work emphasizing the importance of media violence in the creation of habitual aggressive patterns of thought, partialling out aggressive attitudes reduced the video game violent/aggression link to nonsignificance. The meta-analyses revealed significant effects of violent video games on aggressive behavior, affect, and cognition; on cardiovascular arousal; and on prosocial behavior. A best-practices meta-analytic approach revealed that contrary to media industry claims, better conducted studies tend to yield stronger effects of violent video games on aggression and aggression-related variables than do more poorly conducted studies.

AB  - The synthesis of the Northwestern school of thought concerning basic and applied research with ideas and challenges from its critics paid off, as demonstrated in this chapter with examples from different areas of research. Similar successes resulted in large-scale evaluation projects in the German health and rehabilitation system (Wittmann, Niibling, & Schmidt, 2002), as well as research about the relationships among working memory, intelligence, knowledge, and complex problem-solving performance in complex computer-based business games (Wittmann & Suess, 1999) not reported here. The key concepts in all reported examples had been the application of symmetry principles in relating predictors, causes, and effects. Of special additional importance was incorporating psychometric principles into the experimental treatment to improve its measurement and to shed light into the black box. Investing more in the assessment of criteria and taking a larger slice out of human behavior over longer periods helped as well. We are reminded that time-series designs are the strongest quasi-experimental ones in terms of internal validity. Tools coined as ambulatory assessment have been developed to better assess behavior, feelings, emotions, and performance in real-life field settings. Fahrenberg and Myrtek (1996, 2001) contributed to their development and described the potential and promises. We are confident that assessment, measurement, theory testing, and construct validation will reach new horizons by integrating these tools into our research designs.

AB  - In The Second Self, Sherry Turkle looks at the computer not as a 'tool,' but as part of our social and psychological lives; she looks beyond how we use computer games and spreadsheets to explore how the computer affects our awareness of ourselves, of one another, and of our relationship with the world. First published in 1984, The Second Self is still essential reading as a primer in the psychology of computation. This twentieth anniversary edition allows us to reconsider two decades of computer culture--to (re)experience what was and is most novel in our new media culture and to view our own contemporary relationship with technology with fresh eyes. Turkle frames this classic work with a new introduction, a new epilogue, and extensive notes added to the original text. Turkle talks to children, college students, engineers, AI scientists, hackers, and personal computer owners--people confronting machines that seem to think and at the same time suggest a new way for us to think--about human thought, emotion, memory, and understanding. Her interviews reveal that we experience computers as being on the border between inanimate and animate; as both an extension of the self and part of the external world. Their special place betwixt and between traditional categories is part of what makes them compelling and evocative. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This chapter examines youth access to violent video games as well as the existing theory and literature on potential negative effects of violent video games. In addition the author presents a meta-analysis of the effects of video games on the domains of aggressive behavior, aggressive affect, physiological arousal, aggressive cognition, and prosocial behavior. The author concludes with lessons learned from the existing literature that should be taken into account in future studies. These lessons include the need for more attention to variability among violent video games when comparing effects of violent and nonviolent games, the need for larger sample sizes in order to reliably detect violent video game effects, the importance of nonviolent or control comparison conditions, the need for more comprehensive reporting of results so as to allow for the calculation of effect sizes, and measures used to quantify video game exposure.

AB  - This interdisciplinary book presents work on emotions in neuroscience, cognitive science, philosophy, computer science, artificial intelligence, and software and game development. The book discusses the components of human emotion and how they might be incorporated into machines, whether artificial agents should convey emotional responses to human users and how such responses could be made believable, and whether agents should accept and interpret the emotions of users without displaying emotions of their own. It also covers the evolution and brain architecture of emotions, offers vocabularies and classifications for defining emotions, and examines emotions in relation to machines, games, virtual worlds, and music.

AB  - The authors present an overview of recent German studies that were presented at a media psychology conference entitled 'The Socio-Emotional Dimension in the Use of Screen Media,' which was held in Cologne, Germany in April 1995. The studies dealt with various screen media, including TV, film, personal computers, and video games, focused on different psychological variables, and used different methods of measurement. To bring some order in these widely divergent studies, the authors identify 3 different theoretical perspectives: (a) emotion as related to cognition; (b) emotion as a motivational factor; and (c) emotion as a quality of social interaction. They argue that parasocial interaction is a key concept for future research on the emotional component of the use of screen media. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Emotions surprise us, leading us to act in ways contrary to our better judgment and seeming to be just beyond our control. The mysterious character of emotions has long inspired ideas about the 'subconscious' and 'drives' that work from hidden regions of our psyche. Aiming to illustrate some of these hidden regions, Katz develops new methods for examining the sources and workings of our emotional life. Katz fills the book with real-life emotions—crying under the pressure of police interrogation, road rage on California freeways, laughter in a funhouse, 8-yr-olds shame-facedly striking out at baseball games—where the rise and fall of emotions can be observed without the artificial influence of the research process. By using videotapes, interviews, ethnographic description, participant observation, and the insights of novelists, Katz studies emotions as physical and embodied rather than as remembered and recounted. He illustrates his methods with photographs and video stills that demonstrate the embodiment of emotions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - [The authors of this book] are working where ideas from social science, psychology, cognitive science and artificial intelligence meet. They are interested in social cognition and social action, and in the complex linkage between environmental structuring and the micro and the macro phenomena (including phenomena of 'emergence') of society. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)
AB  - In this book we aim to explore the role of the external (social) environment in the regulation of cognitive autonomous agents' behaviours. In particular, the following issues are examined: how objective conditions and relations regulate social action, i.e., how they determine the agents' knowledge and motivations to act (their beliefs and goals) [and] how an autonomous agent becomes an instrument for external forces (an instrument for other agents' needs and requests, as well as for social conventions, norms, laws, etc.).  We endeavour to show that cognition is a fundamental medium between individual action and external (social) forces, cognitive medium meaning the mental interpretation and processing of these external forces.  [The audience for this book includes] all interested in computer science and its applications, particulary to theories of action and agent architecture, multi-agent systems and distributed AI [artificial intelligence], computer supported co-operative work (CSCW), etc.; cognitive scientists, philosophers and psychologists [and] social scientists, especially sociologists and theorists of rationality, game-theorists and social simulators.

AB  - This new addition to the series Artificial Intelligence Foundations and Concepts has two main themes: firstly, the need to present artificial intelligence to the reader with little or no formal training in computer studies, and secondly, the need to 'pin down' a number of powerful objections which have been made to the progress of of AI [artificial intelligence] and have threatened to prejudice its future. It provides a sustained and detailed discussion of the arguments involved, at the same time keeping computer 'gee whiz' jargon to the bare minimum.  The author employs a highly readable style to convey his subject, commencing with an in-depth review of Turing's Imitation Game, and asking important questions such as 'What does the imitation game test?', and 'What should the computer be trying to do with it?'. He uses two examples (PARRY and computer chess) to provide a study of what computers can do: and investigates the Socratic method and Dreyfus's strategy to illustrate what computers cannot do. He discusses Searle's strategy and provides a detailed reply to the famous Chinese room.  He reviews a range of problems with applied classical logic to AI, e.g. logics for paradoxes, correcting the mistakes of classical logic, and logic for intelligent artefacts. His chapter on living with computers investigates the issue of distinguishing life from non-life, autonomous movement, the systems approach to finding life, and the concept of computers with free will.

AB  - A principal aim of artificial intelligence (AI) research is to produce machines able to do things which, if done by humans, would require intelligence. As a discipline, AI straddles the traditional territory of the philosopher, the psychologist and the computer scientist. In this book I have approached AI from the point of view of a philosopher of mind and have argued throughout that machines are or will be capable of behaviour which is best explained by saying that the machines in question literally are intelligent, thinking, feeling and so on.  In Chapter 1, I examine the criteria for intelligence laid down by Alan Turing and suggest some improvements.  In Chapter 2, I look at the performance of some computers which seem to be intelligent but which actually fall short.  Chapter 3 is an examination of the work of Herbert Dreyfus, in which I express a number of reasons for rejecting his criticisms of AI.  In Chapter 4, I closely examine the recent work of John Searle and explain why we should not go along with his reservations about the possibility of computer intelligence.  Chapter 5 looks at the way in which intelligent computers would reason in situations where they hold contradictory beliefs and I suggest a solution to their difficulties.  Finally, in Chapter 6, I explore the possibility that computers may be an emergent life form. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)
