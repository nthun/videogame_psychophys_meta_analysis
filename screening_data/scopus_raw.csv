Understanding public health opinions on social media, such as Twitter, offers a unique approach to characterizing common health issues such as diabetes, diet, exercise, and obesity (DDEO); however, collecting and analyzing a large scale conversational public health data set is a challenging research task. The goal of this research is to analyze the characteristics of the general public's opinions in regard to diabetes, diet, exercise and obesity (DDEO) as expressed on Twitter. A multi-component semantic and linguistic framework was developed to collect Twitter data, discover topics of interest about DDEO, and analyze the topics. From the extracted 4.5 million tweets, 8% of tweets discussed diabetes, 23.7% diet, 16.6% exercise, and 51.7% obesity. The strongest correlation among the topics was determined between exercise and obesity (p <.0002). Other notable correlations were: diabetes and obesity (p <.0005), and diet and obesity (p <.001). DDEO terms were also identified as subtopics of each of the DDEO topics. The frequent subtopics discussed along with “Diabetes”, excluding the DDEO terms themselves, were blood pressure, heart attack, yoga, and Alzheimer. The non-DDEO subtopics for “Diet” included vegetarian, pregnancy, celebrities, weight loss, religious, and mental health, while subtopics for “Exercise” included computer games, brain, fitness, and daily plan. Non-DDEO subtopics for “Obesity” included Alzheimer, cancer, and children. With 2.67 billion social media users in 2016, publicly available data such as Twitter posts can be utilized to support clinical providers, public health experts, and social scientists in better understanding common public opinions in regard to diabetes, diet, exercise, and obesity. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029596678

Contrary to most of previous studies of labor market we apply a game theoretic approach to defining entities in labor market: companies and workers. A company can choose the level of wages, and workers can select the level of effort to increase the productivity in response to the wages. Company and worker agents are designed to possess the basic attributes in order to reflect the real labor market and their activities are adaptively changed using evolutionary model. Our approach is illustrated with four simulation results: the effect of workers resignation, sick leave, dismissal of companies, and productivity growth. Various experiments were conducted to analyze the interactions between worker and company, indicating that performance-based reward strategy and non-greedy strategy in job changing are necessary for companies and workers. The experimental results confirm that the balanced power between worker and company is important in maintenance and extension of labor market, and Nash equilibrium can be maintained in all the cases. © 2017",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85023158141

Twelve male handball players performed 10 C-SSG and 10 NC-SSG while being monitored through the heart rate (HR) and rate of perceived exertion (RPE) as physiological responses and time-motion activities profile using video-match analysis. Both game conditions resulted in similar HR responses (P > 0.05), but the NC-SSG led to a higher RPE scores. The time-motion activity analysis featured NC-SSG with a greater amount of walking (855.6 ± 25.1 vs. 690.6 ± 35.2 m) and backward movements (187.5 ± 12.3 vs. 142.5 ± 8.7 m) combined with fast running (232.3 ± 8.5 vs. 159.7 ± 5.7 m) and sprinting (79.5 ± 4.7 vs. 39.7 ± 3.7 m) activities (P < 0.001). Conversely, C-SSG had a higher percentage of jogging and sideway movements associated with greater frequency of jumping (0.87 ± 0.09 vs. 0.31 ± 0.06 nr) and physical contact (1.82 ± 0.55 vs. 0.25 ± 0.03 nr) events (P < 0.001). No between-regimen differences were found for the number of throws (P = 0.745).

This has traditionally been attributed to physical activity displacement. A little-explored area is whether behavioural stresses alter sensations of appetite and eating behaviour. We examined whether behaviours conducted seated (television viewing, video gaming) induce different eating patterns, associated with differential levels of stress response. Methods and findings We conducted a randomized controlled trial in 72 overweight/obese adult males, assigned to three groups (24 per group): (i) non-violent television (control group); (ii) non-violent game (FIFA); (iii) violent game (Call of Duty). Following a standardized breakfast, the 1-h intervention was followed by 25-min rest, with sweet and savoury snacks and drinks available ad libitum. Stress markers (heart rate, blood pressure, visual analogue scale (VAS)) were measured throughout. Heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and stress by VAS were significantly higher (p < 0.05) playing video games than watching non-violent television, though the two game groups did not differ. Considered separately, only the violent video game group consumed more energy (Δ = 208.3 kcal, 95%CI 16, 400), sweet foods (Δ = 25.9 g, 95%CI 9.9, 41.9) and saturated fat (Δ = 4.36 g, 95%CI 0.76, 7.96) than controls. Conclusion Playing video games in overweight/obese adult males is associated with an acute stress response relative to watching non-violent television, associated with greater subsequent food intake. These findings highlight the need to focus on the metabolic effects, as well as the energy costs, of activities involving sitting in relation to obesity risk. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028554109

As an alternative, complex systems researchers often use agent-based models (ABM) or multi-agent systems (MAS) to model and simulate complexity in human-environmental interactions. This paper briefly reports on the development of a novel cyberinfrastructure portal solution called GeoGames. This computing environment integrates and leverages web-GIS and multiplayer online game technology to enable simulations of real-world scenarios of coupled human and natural systems applicable to anything from cities, urban regions to other human settlements. While there are some similarities between GeoGames and games like SimCity, and Civilization, a fundamental idea underlying the GeoGames approach is the focus on creating an on-line world that mirrors (c.f. Gelernter, 1991) authentic real-world geography, realized by a full range of GIS supported mapping and processing services (Ahlqvist, Loffing, Ramanathan, & Kocher, P). In the context of our prototype platform we present the emerging area of Spatial Game Analytics (Drachen & Schubert, 2013) that provides an uncharted area for data-intensive geospatial scenario analysis. Our example scenario is a game that models the relationships of land management on hydrology and water quality. Our presentation is illustrated with examples from our own prototype platform that has generated a significant amount of user data on game play decisions and behavior. Exploratory GeoGame analytics are used to mine the spatial behavior of hundreds of players in order to identify how variations in the rules (land use policies) and varying locations (spatial configurations) affect the simulation outcomes. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85033684300

We explored the effects of gender and prior experience on aerobic and anaerobic energy systems contributions, and the activity profiles of 40 participants playing with a swimming exergame. We recorded oxygen consumption and assessed blood lactate after each swimming technique. We also filmed participants' gameplays, divided them into different phases and tagged them as active or inactive. Anaerobic pathway accounted for 8.9 ± 5.6% of total energy expenditure and although experienced players were less active compared to novice counterparts (η2; &lt; 0.15, p &lt; 0.05), physiological measures were not different between performing groups. However, players with real-swimming experience during the first technique had higher heart rate (partial-η2 = 0.09, p &lt; 0.05). Our results suggest that short-term increase in physiological measures might happen in the beginning of gameplay because of unfamiliarity with the game mechanics. Despite low levels of activity compared to real sport, both aerobic and anaerobic energy systems should be considered in the evaluation of exergames. Game mechanics (involving the whole body) and strategies to minimize pragmatic play might be used for effective and meaningful game experience. © 2017 The Author(s).",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85024122922

A host of literature has been published in the academic realm about how cooperation could be cultivated. However, true cooperation often forms organically without external enforcement. Recently, there has been one special example of a context where cooperation seemed to have effortlessly sprung up between people who might not even have had previous connections. The context is video/online games; games such as Ingress, Pokémon Go, and World of Warcraft bind people together to work against insurmountable odds and to overcome jointly held challenges. Organizations of many types have recently begun to gamify their structures and services in order to cultivate such seamless cooperation. However, before this potential of games can be successfully wielded outside video games, we need to understand better how games are able to cultivate such cooperation. Therefore, in this study we investigate how games can induce and cultivate we-intention of working as a group. Specifically, we investigate how cooperative game features affect different forms of group dynamics and how they further translate into we-intentions. We employ data from users of the augmented reality game Ingress (N = 206). The results show that cooperative game features induce we-intentions via positively increasing group norms, social identity, joint commitment, attitudes toward cooperation, and anticipated positive emotions. The findings imply that practitioners who are looking to increase cooperation should find that gamification inspired by cooperative game design is beneficial and preferable over individual-based gamification efforts. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028695881

Progress on understanding spatiotemporal contextual processes in humans has been slow in large measure by the methodological constraint of generating and manipulating immersive spatial environments in well-controlled laboratory settings. Fortunately, immersive Virtual Reality (iVR) technology has improved appreciably and affords a relatively straightforward methodology to investigate the role of context on learning, memory, and emotion while maintaining experimental control. Here, we review context conditioning literature in humans and describe challenges to study contextual learning in humans. We then provide details for a novel context threat (fear) conditioning paradigm in humans using a commercially available VR headset and a cross-platform game engine. This paradigm resulted in the acquisition of subjective threat, threat-conditioned defensive responses, and explicit threat memory. We make the paradigm publicly available and describe obstacles and solutions to optimize future studies of context conditioning using iVR. As computer technology advances to replicate the sensation of realistic environments, there are increasing opportunities to bridge the translational gap between rodent and human research on how context modulates cognition, which may ultimately lead to more optimal treatment strategies for anxiety- and stress-related disorders. © 2017 The Author(s).",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027845754

The Workgroup on Media Violence and Violent Video Games reviewed numerous meta-analyses and other relevant research from the past 60 years, with an emphasis on violent video game research. Consistent with every major science organization review, the Workgroup found compelling evidence of short-term harmful effects, as well as evidence of long-term harmful effects. The vast majority of laboratory-based experimental studies have revealed that violent media exposure causes increased aggressive thoughts, angry feelings, physiologic arousal, hostile appraisals, aggressive behavior, and desensitization to violence and decreases prosocial behavior (eg, helping others) and empathy. Still, to more fully understand the potential for long-term harm from media violence exposure, the field is greatly in need of additional large-sample, high-quality, longitudinal studies that include validated measures of media violence exposure and measures of other known violence risk factors. Also, although several high-quality media violence intervention studies have been conducted, larger-scale studies with more comprehensive and longer-term assessments are needed to fully understand long-term effects and to inform the development of tools that will help to reduce problems associated with aggression and violence. The evidence that violent screen media constitutes a causal risk factor for increased aggression is compelling. Modern social-cognitive theories of social behavior provide useful frameworks for understanding how and why these effects occur.

Data are logged throughout the interactions in order to assess the individual's mastery of subject matters, skills, and proficiencies on both cognitive and noncognitive characteristics. There are different agent-based designs that focus on learning and assessment. Dialogues occur between one agent and one human, as in the case of intelligent tutoring systems. Three-party conversations, called trialogues, involve two agents interacting with a human. The two agents can take on different roles (such as tutors and peers), model actions and social interactions, stage arguments, solicit help from the human, and collaboratively solve problems. Examples of assessment with these agent-based environments are presented in the context of intelligent tutoring, educational games, and interventions to help struggling adult readers.

Achieving either the China Class II or World Health Organization PM2.5 standard would yield greater health benefits (992 000 [95% uncertainty interval, 790 000-1 180 000] or 1 827 000 [95% uncertainty interval, 1 481 00-2 129 000] annual life-years gained, respectively) than World Health Organization-recommended goals of 25% improvement in systolic hypertension control and 30% reduction in smoking combined (928 000 [95% uncertainty interval, 830 000-1 033 000] life-years).CONCLUSIONS: Air quality improvement in different scenarios could lead to graded health benefits ranging from 241 000 life-years gained to much greater benefits equal to or greater than the combined benefits of 25% improvement in systolic hypertension control and 30% smoking reduction. © 2017 American Heart Association, Inc.",28882886,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032154711

This has led some researchers to conceptualize the problematic behaviors associated with this disorder as being, at least in part, caused by a deficiency in processing reward stimuli. Considering the documented similarities between substance use disorder and disordered gambling, the current study sought to investigate whether problem gamblers also display such an aberrant pattern of incentive processing. Skin conductance responses (SCRs) to small and large magnitude wins were recorded from 16 problem gamblers (PGs) and 16 healthy controls (HCs) while they completed a computer-simulated electronic gaming machine task. The results show that, while large wins elicited greater SCRs compared to small wins for the HC group, no difference in SCR amplitude was found following large and small wins in the PG group. These findings suggest that problem gamblers may be less effective at evaluating the value of incentives, and are discussed in terms of relevant theoretical frameworks. © 2017 Society for Psychophysiological Research",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019860106

The aim of this study is to clarify the natural and clinical courses of IGD proposed DSM-5 in adolescents and to evaluate its risk and protective factors. Methods and analysis The Internet user Cohort for Unbiased Recognition of gaming disorder in Early Adolescence (iCURE) study is an ongoing multidisciplinary, prospective, longitudinal cohort study conducted in 21 schools in Korea. Participant recruitment commenced in March 2015 with the goal of registering 3000 adolescents. The baseline assessment included surveys on emotional, social and environmental characteristics. A parent or guardian completed questionnaires and a structured psychiatric comorbidity diagnostic interview regarding their children. Adolescents with the Internet Game Use-Elicited Symptom Screen total scores of 6 or higher were asked to participate in the clinical diagnostic interview. Two subcohorts of adolescents were constructed: a representative subcohort and a clinical evaluation subcohort. The representative subcohort comprises a randomly selected 10% of the iCURE to investigate the clinical course of IGD based on clinical diagnosis and to estimate the false negative rate. The clinical evaluation subcohort comprised participants meeting three or more of the nine IGD criteria, determined by clinical diagnostic interview, to show the clinical course of IGD. Follow-up data will be collected annually for the 3 years following the baseline assessments. The primary endpoint is 2-year incidence, remission and recurrence rates of IGD. Cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between exposures and outcomes as well as mediation factors will be evaluated.

To overcome this shortcoming, in this paper, it is proposed the creation of intelligent environments for conflict resolution that can complement the existing tools with important knowledge about the context of interaction.

Little is known, however, about whether or not character model changes may impact players' relationships with familiar avatars, especially since anthropomorphism-the perception of nonhuman objects as being human or humanlike-is understood as central to player-avatar interaction (PAX). This study leveraged a naturally occurring change to massively multiplayer online game avatars to conduct a field quasiexperiment to investigate whether enhanced avatar anthropomorphism influences PAX dimensions: emotional investment, anthropomorphic autonomy, suspension of disbelief, and sense of control. Longitudinal analysis showed that enhanced anthropomorphism had no significant impact on any PAX dimension immediately or over time, when controlling for demographic and gameplay variables. Player comments suggest the change was experienced not as a change in humanness, but as a shift in perceptual realism-believability, lifelikeness, depth-that impacted the experience of the avatar-mediated gameworld more broadly.

Methods: A 5-week MOOC on behavioral medicine was hosted on the edX platform. The authors developed two branched virtual patients consisting of video recordings of a live standardized patient, with multiple clinical decision points and narration unfolding depending on learners' choices. Students interacted with the virtual patients to treat stress and sleep problems. Answers to the exit survey and participant comments from the discussion forum were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. Results: In total, 19,236 participants enrolled in the MOOC, out of which 740 received the final certificate. The virtual patients were completed by 2317 and 1640 participants respectively. Among survey respondents (n = 442), 83.1% agreed that the virtual patient exercise was helpful. The qualitative analysis resulted in themes covering what it was like to work with the virtual patient, with subthemes on learner-centered education, emotions/eustress, game comparisons, what the participants learned, what surprised them, how confident participants felt about applying interventions in practice, suggestions for improvement, and previous experiences of virtual patients. Conclusions: Students were enthusiastic about interacting with the virtual patients as a means to apply new knowledge about behavioral medicine interventions. The most common suggestion was to incorporate more interactive cases with various levels of complexity.

Methods Children with T1DM (N = 27) participated in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in which they played a diabetes mellitus self-management education (DMSE) game, namely a diabetes quiz, with a personal or neutral robot on three occasions at the clinic, or were allocated to a control group (care as usual). Personalised robot behaviour was based on the self-determination theory (SDT), focusing on the children's needs for competence, relatedness and autonomy. The SDT determinants pleasure, motivation and diabetes knowledge were measured. Child-robot interaction was observed, including level of engagement. Results Results showed an increase in diabetes knowledge in children allocated to the robot groups and not in those allocated to the control group (P =.001). After three sessions, children working with the personal robot scored higher for determinants of SDT than children with the neutral robot (P = .02). They also found the robot to be more pleasurable (P =.04), they answered more quiz questions correctly (P =.02), and were more motivated to play a fourth time (P = .03). The analysis of audio/video recordings showed that in regard to engagement, children with the personal robot were more attentive to the robot, more social, and more positive (P < .05). Conclusion The study showed how a personal robot that plays DMSE games and applies STD based strategies (i.e., provides constructive feedback, acknowledges feelings and moods, encourages competition and builds a rapport) can help to improve health literacy in children in an pleasurable, engaging and motivating way. Using a robot in health care could contribute to self-management in children with a chronic disease and help them to cope with their illness. © 2017",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020846040

Eliciting children’s perspectives regarding their life experiences during cancer treatment can be challenging. The purpose of this study was to characterize elementary school-age children’s “good days” and “sick days” through their drawings. Methods: This study used draw-and-tell interviews, a developmentally sensitive arts-based technique that supports children’s recall and communication of information, facilitating a deeper understanding of children’s personal interpretation and meaning of a given phenomenon of interest. Children were asked to draw pictures representing both a “good day” and a “sick day.” Following completion of each drawing, research team members used a semi-structured interview guide to elicit children’s explanations of their pictures. Content analysis techniques were used to descriptively characterize children’s drawings followed by thematic analysis to identify commonalities. Results: Participants were 27 children 6.33–12.83 years of age (mean 9.16 years; SD = 1.9) receiving treatment for cancer. “Good day” and “sick day” pictures were similar with regards to the presence of the child, the inclusion of other individuals, and the type of art medium used. Children’s pictures characterized “good days” as being happy, outside in sunny weather, and engaged in activities. In contrast, “sick days” were characterized as feeling sad, lying down or reclining, and experiencing illness-related symptoms. Conclusions: Children’s drawings illustrate their capacity to provide rich personal data related to their “good days” and “sick days.” Incorporating arts-based strategies in the clinical setting may provide a child-centric strategy to understand the child’s perspective and direct interventions. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020704956

This paper addresses a challenge of hinterland transport planning caused by limited information sharing, lack of collaboration and COI. We design collaboration and decision-making mechanisms for the implementation of autonomous control by means of multi agent technology and hybrid heuristics. It aims at providing quality plan to achieve high level of performance and robustness in hinterland logistics.

From an operational point of view, special attentions are paid on establishing multi-dimensional collaborations between different stakeholders under the support of game theoretic approach. Specifically, we define how planning activities are executed, which level of collaborations are incorporated and how benefits are achieved with a global point of view. Due to the NP-hard nature of the addressed problem, an integrated NGSA-II and simulated annealing algorithm is implemented for assisting decision making.

Realistic (life-like) animation of nonplayer characters (NPCs) in such virtual worlds is particularly important to enhance the gaming experience. Multiagent systems are one effective approach to synthesize life-like behaviors and interactions by codifying simple rules into NPCs (each NPC as an autonomous agent). However, such behaviors generally come at the cost of increasing computational expense and complexity in terms of aspects such as number of rules and parameters. Therefore, the desire for high fidelity (highly realistic) behaviors is often in conflict with the drive for low complexity. Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms provide a sophisticated mechanism to optimize two or more conflicting objectives simultaneously. However, evolutionary computing techniques need an appropriate objective function to drive the exploration in the correct direction. Pairing of evolutionary techniques and multiagent systems is challenging in the classes of problems in which the fitness is evaluated based on human aesthetic judgment rather than on objective forms of measurements. In this study, we present a multiobjective evolutionary framework to evolve low complexity and high fidelity multiagent systems by utilizing a machine learning system trained by bootstrapping human aesthetic judgment. We have gathered empirical data in three problem areas - simulation of conversational group dynamics, sheepdog herding behaviors, and traffic dynamics, and show the effectiveness of our approach in deriving low complexity and high fidelity multiagent systems. Further, we have identified common properties of the Pareto-optimal frontiers in the three problem areas that can ultimately lead to an understanding of a relationship between simulation model complexity and behavior fidelity. This understanding will be useful in deciding which level of behavioral fidelity is required for the characters in video games based on the distance to the camera, importance to the scene, and available computational resources. © 2009-2012 IEEE.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030109394

However, it is unclear whether training lay bystanders using an ultra-brief video at a mass gathering event improves CPR quality and responsiveness. Objective To determine if showing a chest-compression only (CCO) Ultra-Brief Video (UBV) at a mass gathering event is effective in teaching lay bystanders CCO-CPR. Methods Prospective control trial in adults (age >18) who attended either a women's University of Arizona or a men's Phoenix Suns basketball game. Participants were evaluated using a standardized cardiac arrest scenario with Laerdal Skillreporter™ mannequins. CPR responsiveness (calling 911, time to calling 911, starting compressions within two minutes) and quality (compression rate, depth, hands-off time) were assessed for participants and data collected at Baseline and Post-intervention. Different participants were tested before and after the exposure of the UBV. Data were analyzed via the intention to treat principle using logistic regression for binary outcomes and median regression for continuous outcomes, controlling for clustering by venue. Results A total of 96 people were consented (Baseline = 45; Post intervention = 51). CPR responsiveness post intervention improved with faster time to calling 911 (s) and time to starting compressions (sec). Likewise, CPR quality improved with deeper compressions and improved hands-off time. Conclusions Showing a UBV at a mass gathering sporting event is associated with improved CPR responsiveness and performance for lay bystanders. This data provides further support for the use of mass media interventions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85025657687

However, collecting emotional states during the interaction time with users is a onerous task because it requires very careful handling of the empirical observation, leading researchers to carry out assessments of emotional responses only at the end of the interaction. This paper reports our research in assessing users’ behavior at interaction time and also describes the results of a case study which analyzed users’ emotional responses while interacting with a game. We argue that capturing emotions during interaction time can help us in making changes on users’ behavior (e.g., changing from stressed to a less stressed state) or even suggesting an user to have a break. This can be all possible if both (1) emotions are captured during interaction and (2) changes are suggested at runtime (e.g., through persuasion). The results of this study suggest that there are significant differences between emotional responses captured during the interaction and those declared at the end. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84961821498

An elementary cell of the network consists of two 1T-TaS2 devices connected in series. Such a cell has a constant output and oscillatory states. All cells have the same bias voltage. There is a constant current flowing through the cell in the constant output mode. The oscillations occur at a certain bias voltage due to the electrical-field triggered metal-to-insulator transition owing to the changes in the charge-density-wave phase in the 1T-TaS2 channel. Two 1T-TaS2 devices oscillate out-of-phase when one of the devices is in the insulator phase while the other one is in the metallic state. The nearest-neighbor cells are coupled via graphene transistors. The cells are resistively coupled if the graphene transistor is in the on state while they are capacitively coupled if the transistor is in the off state. The operation of the oscillatory neural network is simulated numerically for the 30 × 30 node network. We present the examples of pattern recognition on a template with the fixed coupling among the near-neighbor cells. We also present the results of our numerical modeling mimicking the Game of Life in the network with the time-varying coupling. The 2-D 1T-TaS2 devices, utilized in the network, offer a unique combination of properties such as scalability, high operational frequency, fast synchronization speed, and radiation hardness, which makes them promising for both consumer electronic and defense applications. © 2002-2012 IEEE.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021824378

Self-determination theory (SDT) is used as a lens for understanding the mechanism by which these traits might lead to enjoyment. Specifically, the argument is that feedback, rules, and social elements of games will fulfill the dimensions of SDT - competence autonomy, and relatedness. Then, the dimensions of SDT will predict enjoyment. Participants were presented with a game that emphasized feedback, rules, or social elements. Games that emphasized flexible rules led to feelings of competence while games that emphasized social elements led to feelings of relatedness. Competence and elatedness then led to feelings of enjoyment. In doing so, this study identifies key elements of video games while illuminating ways to understand video game enjoyment. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017130843

We hypothesized that a game-like simulation could improve perceptions and performance of novices. Methods A videogame was developed, combining pictures and short videos, by which students are interactively instructed on acting at the surgical block. Moreover, the game includes detailed descriptive information. After playing, students are given feedback on their performance. A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 132 nursing and medical students with no previous experience in surgery. Sixty two (47.0%) were allocated to a control group (CG) and 70 (53.0%) to an experimental group (EG). Subjects in EG played the game the day prior to their first experience in the theatre; CG had no access to the application. On the day after their experience at surgery, all students filled in a questionnaire in a 7-point Likert format collecting subjective data about their experience in the surgical block. Four constructs related to students' feelings, emotions and attitudes were measured through self-reported subjective scales, i.e. C1: fear to make mistakes, C2: perceived knowledge on how to behave, C3: perceived errors committed, and C4: attitude/behaviour towards patients and staff. The main research question was formulated as follows: do students show differences in constructs C1–C4 by exposure to the game? Results EG reported statistically significant higher scores on the four aspects measured than CG (p < 0.05; Mann-Whitney U tests; Cohen's d standardized effect size d1 = 0.30; d2 = 1.05; d3 = 0.39; d4 = 0.49). Conclusions Results show clear evidence that the exposure to the game-like simulation had a significant positive effect on all the constructs.

Twenty-nine outpatients (21 men; 22.8±5.1 years) performed a maximal exercise test to assess their maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max), wore a Senswear armband for five consecutive days and were assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Twenty-four patients (82.8%) scored below the normative cardiorespiratory values. The percent-predicted VO2max ranged from 47% to 109%. In a backward regression analysis, less time spent sedentary (min/day) was the only independent predictor of a higher VO2max. The model explained 28.0% of the variance in the VO2max-score. The current study indicates that future research should explore whether reducing sedentary behaviour (e.g. time spent napping or prolonged sitting during waking hours) might improve cardio-respiratory fitness levels. Interventions targeting recreational screen time (watching television, computer use, playing video games, etc.) or replacing passive to more active video games should be investigated. © 2017 Elsevier Ireland Ltd",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015290808

The feasibility, safety, and efficacy of in-class AVG supplementation as an alternative to conventional phase 2 programs were investigated. Methods: A pilot, evaluator-blinded, intention-to-treat, randomized controlled trial recruited 32 low-moderate risk CR participants and allocated them to conventional or AVG-supplemented exercise. Both groups experienced equal exercise loads for 6 weeks. Patients were assessed at baseline, end of the program, and after an 8-week followup. Adherence and safety-related outcomes were the primary endpoints. Secondary outcomes included change in exercise capacity, daily physical activity (PA), energy expenditure (EE), and psychometric profiling. Results: Patients (males 81%; 60 ± 10 years) presented with typical cardiovascular risk factors and similar baseline characteristics. Participants did not perceive an increased risk of injury and were more interactive. At the end of the program, there was a lower tendency for dropping out (6% vs 19%, P >.05), a significant improvement in PA (322 vs 247 arbitrary acceleration units/min, P =.047) and related EE per body weight (13 vs 11 kcal/kg/d, P =.04) among AVG participants compared with controls. No significant differences between groups for adverse medical events, exercise capacity, affect toward exercise, anxiety, depression, or quality-of-life changes were reported. Conclusions: The additional use of AVGs during CR sessions is feasible, safe, and significantly improved daily PA and EE. A dropout reduction trend among its users, which needs to be confirmed in a larger trial, raises awareness to AVG supplementation as a promising strategy to increase CR adherence.

An automation failure together with a car in front braking was then simulated; a rare but very critical situation for a non-attentive driver to be in. Multimodal abstract or language-based warnings signifying this situation were then delivered, either from the simulator or from the tablet, in order to discover the most effective location. Results showed that abstract cues, including audio, and cues delivered from the tablet improved handovers.

Participants viewed a video of their partner's message, after reading that there was a good chance (75%) their partner was instructed to lie.

The relationship between sedentary behavior and respiratory health remains poorly elucidated. To date there have been no studies evaluating the relationship between sedentary behavior and pulmonary function in young populations. The purpose of this study is to examine the association between the trajectory of screen-based sedentary behavior from 11 to 18 years and pulmonary function at 18 years in a Brazilian birth cohort. Methods: Data from a longitudinal prospective study conducted among the participants of the 1993 Pelotas (Brazil) Birth Cohort. Time spent on television, video games, and computers during a weekday was self-reported at ages 11, 15 and 18 years. For each age, sedentary behavior was defined as the sum of time spent on these screen-based activities. To evaluate the sedentary behavior trajectory during adolescence group-based trajectory modeling was used. Outcome variables were three pulmonary function parameters: forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and peak expiratory flow (PEF), evaluated by spirometry, at 18 years expressed as z-scores. Crude and adjusted linear regressions, stratified by sex, were performed. Results: The three-group trajectory of sedentary behavior was the best fitting model. The trajectory groups were: always high (representing 38.8% of the individuals), always moderate (54.1%), and always low (7.1%). In the adjusted analyses, boys in the always-low group for sedentary behavior had higher FVC at 18 years (β = 0.177; 95% CI:0.027;0.327; p = 0.021) than boys in the always-high group. There were no differences for other pulmonary function parameters in boys. No significant association was found for girls. Conclusion: The trajectory of screen-based sedentary behavior throughout adolescence was not consistent associated with pulmonary function at 18 years. © 2017 The Author(s).",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021242040

To support these actors, we developed a mixed reality application that allows showing digital environments while performing and being able to see the real and virtual world. We tested our prototype with 6 traditionally trained theatre and TV actors.

In the organizational context, the Technology-Enhanced Training Effectiveness Model [TETEM] provides a framework to understand how technologies, like gamification, can effect change in various instructional outcomes. Specifically, application of TETEM suggests that gamification may not effect change in instructional outcomes when learner attitudes towards game-based learning and experience with video games are low. Method In this study, we test this model in the gamification context by assigning potential learners to read scenarios describing gamified instruction or traditional, PowerPoint instruction in a random order and assessing their training valence. Results On average, participants anticipated greater value from gamified instruction, but as predicted by TETEM, this effect was moderated by both video game experience and attitudes towards game-based learning. Among potential learners with high experience and attitudes, gamification produces better outcomes than PowerPoint, but among potential learners with low experience and attitudes, gamification produces worse outcomes than PowerPoint. Implications We provide empirical support for TETEM and conclude that for gamification to be successful, the attitudes and experience of participants must be assessed and ensured before gamification is implemented. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84940835959

At the same time, the pervasiveness of computing devices is also encouraging more research in human–computer interaction, especially in the direction of personalized and adaptive user interfaces. Among the various research issues, affective computing, or the ability of computers to understand and react according to what a user “feels,” has been gaining in importance. In order to recognize the human affect (feeling), computers rely on the analysis of signal inputs captured by a multitude of means. This paper proposes the use of human physiological signals as a new form of modality in determining human affects, in a non-intrusive manner. The principle of non-invasiveness is very important, since it imposes no extra burden on the user, which improves user accessibility and encourages user adoption. This goal is realized via the physiological mouse, as a first step toward the support of affective computing. The conventional mouse is converted with a small optical component for capturing user photoplethysmographic (PPG) signal. With the PPG signal, it is possible to compute and derive human physiological signals. A prototype of the physiological mouse was built and raw PPG readings measured. The accuracy of the approach was evaluated through empirical studies to determine human physiological signals from the mouse PPG data. Finally, pilot experiments to correlate human physiological signals with various modes of human–computer interaction, namely gaming and video watching, were conducted. The trend in physiological signals could be used as feedback to the computer system which in turn adapts to the needs or the mood of the user, for instance change the volume and the light intensity when watching a video or playing a game based on current user emotion. The authors argue that this research will provide a new dimension for multimodal affective computing research, and the pilot study has already shed some light toward this research goal. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84966318851

Two important digital WOM types are microblogs and consumer reviews. To clarify their differential roles for product success, this study offers a theoretical framework of the influence of these two types of WOM, drawing from consumer information search theory and diffusion theory. The tests of the proposed framework use a longitudinal data set of video game sales and weekly information gathered from microblogs (i.e., over 13 million tweets from Twitter) and consumer reviews (i.e., more than 17,000 Amazon consumer reviews). Analyzing a system of equations provides evidence that the influence of microblogs and consumer reviews on new product success changes over time. Prior to launch, the volumes of microblogs and consumer reviews, together with advertising, represent primary sales drivers. After launch, the volume of microblogs is initially influential, then loses impact, whereas the impact of the volume of consumer reviews continues to grow. The valence of consumer reviews gains significance only near the end of the observation period, but the valence of microblogging is never influential. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85008219333

Such game-solving algorithms scale poorly as the size of the game graph increases. However, in many applications, the game graph has a natural hierarchical structure. In this paper, we propose a modeling formalism and a synthesis algorithm that exploits this hierarchical structure for more scalable synthesis. We define local games on hierarchical graphs as a modeling formalism that decomposes a large-scale reactive synthesis problem in two dimensions. First, the construction of a hierarchical game graph introduces abstraction layers, where each layer is again a two-player game graph. Second, every such layer is decomposed into multiple local game graphs, each corresponding to a node in the higher level game graph. While local games have the potential to reduce the state space for controller synthesis, they lead to more complex synthesis problems where strategies computed for one local game can impose additional requirements on lower-level local games. Our second contribution is a procedure to construct a dynamic controller for local game graphs over hierarchies. The controller computes assume-admissible winning strategies that satisfy local specifications in the presence of environment assumptions, and dynamically updates specifications and strategies due to interactions between games at different abstraction layers at each step of the play. We show that our synthesis procedure is sound: the controller constructs a play that satisfies all local specifications. We illustrate our results through an example controlling an autonomous robot in a building with known floor plan and provide simulation results using an implementation of our algorithm on top of LTLMoP. © 2017, The Author(s).",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018762016

The project came about in relation to having identified a lack of research about and actual physical-digital games designed specifically for children living in adverse (‘dark’) times. This is despite the fact that there is a substantial body of research that has shown how play is beneficial for helping children make sense of what is happening to them, and thus results in better mental, emotional and physical well-being.

Specifically, these activities used art-and-design-based methods as a means of knowing through making. The methods are discussed in relation to how they generated knowledge that responded to the objectives of the project. These were, firstly, to allow children to express emotions about their illness and/or being in hospital; secondly, to offer information on the hospital experience; and, finally, to develop a design that could cross physical and digital platforms with a space for open-ended child-directed play.

In a behavioral and a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment, participants played a multiround interactive game where they received pain stimulation. An anonymous partner interacted with the participants and either intentionally or unintentionally (i.e., determined by a computer program) bore part of the participants' pain. In each round, participants either evaluated their perceived pain intensity (behavioral experiment) or transferred an amount of money to the partner (fMRI experiment). Intentional (relative to unintentional) help led to lower experience of pain, higher reciprocity (money allocation), and increased interpersonal closeness toward the partner. fMRI revealed that for the most grateful condition (i.e., intentional help), value-related structures such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) showed the highest activation in response to the partner's decision, whereas the primary sensory area and the anterior insula exhibited the lowest activation at the pain delivery stage. Moreover, the vmPFC activation was predictive of the individual differences in reciprocal behavior, and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) activation was predictive of self-reported gratitude.

An experimental investigation was conducted in which human participants interacted with a humanoid robot whose facial expression was shown on an LCD monitor that was mounted as its head (Study 1). Participants were asked to play the ultimatum game, which is usually used to measure human altruistic behavior. All participants were assigned to be the proposer and were instructed to decide their offer within 1 min by controlling a slider bar. The corners of the robot's mouth, as indicated by the line drawing, simply moved upward, or downward depending on the position of the slider bar. The results suggest that the change in the facial expression depicted by a simple line drawing of a face significantly affected the participant's final offer in the ultimatum game. The offers were increased by 13% when subjects were shown contingent changes of facial expression. The results were compared with an experiment in a teleoperation setting in which participants interacted with another person through a computer display showing the same line drawings used in Study 1 (Study 2). The results showed that offers were 15% higher if participants were shown a contingent facial expression change. Together, Studies 1 and 2 indicate that emotional expression in simple line drawings of a robot's face elicits the same higher offer from humans as a human telepresence does. © 2017 Terada and Takeuchi.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019632939

In this study, the positive impact of action video gaming among congenitally deaf subjects is investigated. Subjects possessed high level of visual information processing capacity. A 96 h of action video game play resulted in the improvement of mean reaction time (mRT) (post = 413.21 ms, pre = 453.39 ms) and certain cognitive functions. Higher heart rate variability (HRV) subjects demonstrated faster and significant improvement in mRT (p < 0.0045) after intervention. The α and β EEG band powers were found increased in parietal (6.33%, 4.28%) and occipital (8.38%, 38%) lobes respectively. The θ band power increased in frontal (32%) and parietal (13%) lobes. These results can reflect enhancement in certain cognitive performances such as visual perception, attention, memory, and motor skills. The ratio index β/(α + θ) increased in frontal and occipital lobes while β/θ increased in frontal and temporal lobes. These results may also suggest improvements in attention processing capacity and neural activity. These results implies improvements in certain aspects of cognition among deaf subjects.

In this paper, we propose a real-time user interface with emotion recognition that depends on the need for skill development to support a change in the interface paradigm to one that is more human centered. The proposed emotion recognition technology may provide services to meet the need to recognize emotions when using contents. Until now, most studies on an emotion recognition interface have used a single signal, which was difficult to apply because of low accuracy. In this study, we developed a complex biological signal emotion recognition system that blends the ratio of an ECG for the autonomic nervous system and the relative power value of an EEG (theta, alpha, beta, and gamma) to improve the low accuracy. The system creates a data map that stores user-specific probabilities to recognize six kinds of feelings (amusement, fear, sadness, joy, anger, and disgust). It updates the weights to improve the accuracy of the emotion corresponding to the brain waves of each channel. In addition, we compared the results of the complex biological signal data set and EEG data set to verify the accuracy of the complex biological signal, and found that the accuracy had increased by 35.78%. The proposed system will be utilized as an interface for controlling a game and smart space for a user with high accuracy. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85004143376

Of these, 68.9% were classified as nonproblematic users, 24.4% as problematic users, and 6.7% as addictive Internet users. High use of discussion forums, high rumination levels, and low levels of self-care were the main contributing factors to Internet addiction (IA) among adolescents. For adults IA was mainly predicted through engagement in online video gaming and sexual activity, low email use, as well as high anxiety and high avoidant coping.

There are different elements with the game, which effect the player’s emotional status. Since the game play experience occurs almost unconsciously, traditional methods such as think aloud may disrupt the playing experience, thus skewing the results obtained. Other methods include fitting cables and electrodes to the player to monitor biological information. Although such devices can offer significant accurate results, they are not commonly found and may cause discomfort while playing games. Because of this, we propose a webcam-based heart rate monitoring method that can be used to predict the player’s emotional state. We first analyzed the change in heart rate with respect to the players emotional state. This allowed us to find a correlation between emotional states, such as frustration, fun, challenge, and boredom. The second objective was to create a webcam-based method to monitor the heart rate. This was performed by extracting the RGB channels from the face region and then retrieving the underlying components using a dimensionality-reduction method. The results obtained from the webcam-based method were far from perfect, but this was expected, since we were performing the tests under realistic conditions. The last objective was to predict the player’s emotional state using the heart rate obtained from the webcam-based method.

In this work we facilitate efficient access from two aspects: event detection and highlight detection. By recognizing designated text displayed on screen when important events occur, we associate game events with time stamps, and accordingly develop an interface to facilitate direct access. For highlight detection, we jointly consider visual features, event features, and viewer’s behavior to construct two highlight models based on the psychophysiological approach and the data-driven approach, respectively. The concatenated highlights then enable compact game video presentation. To facilitate adaptive live streaming, a novel highlight forecast model is built to predict whether there will be a highlight in the next seconds, so that the streaming system can allocate more resource for more important segments on the fly.

Subjective appetite was assessed at baseline, 15, 30, and 45 min during the treatment condition, and upon trial completion at 75 min. Subjective emotions were assessed at baseline and at 45 min. Results FI was not affected by screen type, but was positively correlated with body composition (fat mass [FM, kg], fat free mass [FFM, kg]) in all treatment conditions. Subjective appetite was not affected by screen type, but increased with time in all treatment conditions (p < 0.0001). Subjective emotions were affected by VGP only. Anger, excitement, frustration, and upset feelings were increased at 45 min following VGP. VGP led to increased frustration compared to control (p = 0.0003), CT (p = 0.007) and TVV (p = 0.0002). Conclusion Exposure to TVV or CT before eating did not affect subjective emotions, subjective appetite, or FI, and no difference was found between screen activities and the control condition for average appetite or FI. Despite a change in subjective emotions during the VGP condition, there was no increase in subjective appetite or subsequent FI. These findings suggest that physiologic signals of satiation and satiety are not overridden by environmental stimuli of pre-meal screen-time exposure among young girls.

Youth at Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) level II (unassisted walking) and level III (mobility aids needed for walking) competed in a cycling-based exercise video game that tested three balancing algorithms. Materials and Methods: Three algorithms: A control (generic-balancing [GB]), a constant non-person specific (One-Speed-For-All [OSFA]), and a person-specific (Target-Cadence [TC]) algorithms were built. In this prospective repeated measures intervention trial with randomized and blinded algorithm assignment, 10 youth with CP aged 10-16 years (X ± standard deviation = 12.4 ± 1.8 years; GMFCS level II n = 4, III n = 6) played six exergaming sessions using each of the three algorithms. Outcomes included game success as measured by a normalized game score, time above 40% HRR, and enjoyment. Results: The TC algorithm balanced game success between GMFCS levels similarly to GB (P = 0.11) and OSFA (P = 0.41). TC showed poorer balancing in time above 40% HRR compared to GB (P = 0.02) and OSFA (P = 0.02). Enjoyment ratings were high (6.4 ± 0.7/7) and consistent between all algorithms (TC vs. GB: P = 0.80 and TC vs. OSFA: P = 0.19). Conclusion: TC shows promise in balancing game success and enjoyment but improvements are needed to balance between GMFCS levels for cardiovascular exercise. © 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018604791

In the present work we study how cooperation and competition emerge between autonomous agents that learn by reinforcement while using only their raw visual input as the state representation. In particular, we extend the Deep Q-Learning framework to multiagent environments to investigate the interaction between two learning agents in the well-known video game Pong. By manipulating the classical rewarding scheme of Pong we show how competitive and collaborative behaviors emerge. We also describe the progression from competitive to collaborative behavior when the incentive to cooperate is increased. Finally we show how learning by playing against another adaptive agent, instead of against a hard-wired algorithm, results in more robust strategies. The present work shows that Deep Q-Networks can become a useful tool for studying decentralized learning of multiagent systems coping with high-dimensional environments. © 2017 Tampuu et al.

SEMLINCS models the development of an embodied cognitive agent that learns discrete production rule-like structures from its own, autonomously gathered, continuous sensorimotor experiences. Moreover, the agent uses the developing knowledge to plan and control environmental interactions in a versatile, goal-directed, and self-motivated manner. Thus, in contrast to several well-known symbolic cognitive architectures, SEMLINCS is not provided with production rules and the involved symbols, but it learns them. In this paper, the actual implementation of SEMLINCS causes learning and self-motivated, autonomous behavioral control of the game figure Mario in a clone of the computer game Super Mario Bros. Our evaluations highlight the successful development of behavioral versatility as well as the learning of suitable production rules and the involved symbols from sensorimotor experiences. Moreover, knowledge- and motivation-dependent individualizations of the agents’ behavioral tendencies are shown. Finally, interaction sequences can be planned on the sensorimotor-grounded production rule level. Current limitations directly point toward the need for several further enhancements, which may be integrated into SEMLINCS in the near future. Overall, SEMLINCS may be viewed as an architecture that allows the functional and computational modeling of embodied cognitive development, whereby the current main focus lies on the development of production rules from sensorimotor experiences.

Previous studies have shown that, in a real-world scenario, the use of single sensors do not provide an accurate emotional assessment. Hence, in this study, we propose a framework that takes into account multiple sensors so that conclusions can be drawn about the emotional state of the user at the time of interaction. The proposed multi-sensing approach includes several inputs from users (such as speech, facial movements, and everyday activities), and uses an artificial intelligent strategy to map these different responses into one or more emotional states. The Componential Emotion Theory and Scherer’s Emotional Semantic Space are used to underpin the theoretical framework. The experimental results show that the combination of outputs generated by multiple sensors provides a more accurate assessment of emotional states than when the sensors are treated individually. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84986269199

These domains collaborate to produce significantly higher processing capacity through load balancing. However, resources in the same domain tend to be cooperative, whereas those in different domains are self-interested. Fairness is the key to collaboration under a self-interested environment. Accordingly, a fairness-aware load balancing algorithm is proposed. The load balancing problem is defined as a game. The Nash equilibrium solution for this problem minimizes the expected response time, while maintaining fairness. Furthermore, reinforcement learning is used to search for the Nash equilibrium. Compared with static approaches, this algorithm does not require a prior knowledge of job arrival and execution, and can adapt dynamically to these processes. The synthesized tests indicate that our algorithm is close to the optimal scheme in terms of overall expected response time under different system utilization, heterogeneity, and system size; it also ensures fairness similar to the proportional scheme. Trace simulation is conducted using the job workload log of the Scalable POWERpallel2 system in the San Diego Supercomputer Center.

Design: Observational and prospective study. Setting: Virginia Tech women's soccer games and practices. Participants: Twenty-six collegiate level women's soccer players with a mean player age of 19 ± 1. Interventions: Participating players were instrumented with head impact sensors for biomechanical analysis. Video recordings of each event were used to manually verify each impact sustained. Main Outcome Measures: Head impact counts by player position and impact situation. Results: The sensors collected data from a total of 17 865 accelerative events, 8999 of which were classified as head impacts. Of these, a total of 1703 impacts were positively identified (19% of total real impacts recorded by sensor), 90% of which were associated with heading the ball. The average number of impacts per player per practice or game was 1.86 ± 1.42. Exposure to head impact varied by player position.

Games are rich sources of perceptual experiences and may facilitate absorption but transpersonal experiences are not guaranteed. Sustained absorption in the game world is tied to the development of player cognitive skills, and to the game world's perceptual environments, interactive functions, and narratives, including challenges and archetypical characters. Games are perceptually detailed, and technology advances are facilitating our entry into narrative universes of virtual fantasy and virtual reality, populated by archetypes, that are limited only by the imagination. Action games make available a rich cognitive, social, and cultural context where players may achieve sustained absorption and access higher levels of consciousness. Parallels between dreams and games, as well as reciprocal processing and behavioral transfers point to games' emotional benefits. This chapter examines digital media features that facilitate transpersonal experiences and identifies ways that makers of virtual worlds can create experiences that amplify consciousness. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This is a wide field, that includes a variety of diseases and related clinical pictures; for this reason the need arises to have a tool available that overcomes the difficulties entailed by what currently is the most common approach, that is, the so-called pen and paper rehabilitation. Methods: We first organized a big number of stimuli in an ontology that represents concepts, attributes and a set of relationships among concepts. Stimuli may be words, sounds, 2D and 3D images. Then, we developed an engine that automatically generates exercises by exploiting that ontology. The design of exercises has been carried on in synergy with neuropsychologists and speech therapists. Solutions have been devised aimed at personalizing the exercises according to both patients’ preferences and performance. Results: Exercises addressed to rehabilitation of executive functions and aphasia-related diseases have been implemented. The system has been tested on both healthy volunteers (n = 38) and patients (n = 9), obtaining a favourable rating and suggestions for improvements. Conclusions: We created a tool able to automate the execution of cognitive rehabilitation tasks. We hope the variety and personalization of exercises will allow to increase compliance, particularly from elderly people, usually neither familiar with technology nor particularly willing to rely on it. The next step involves the creation of a telerehabilitation tool, to allow therapy sessions to be undergone from home, thus guaranteeing continuity of care and advantages in terms of time and costs for the patients and the National Healthcare System (NHS).Implications for rehabilitation Cognitive impairments can greatly impact an individual's existence, appreciably reducing his abilities and autonomy, as well as sensibly lowering his quality of life. Cognitive rehabilitation can be used to restore lost brain function or slow down degenerative diseases. Computerization of rehabilitation entails many advantages, but patients–especially elderly people–might be less prone to the use of technology and consequently reluctant towards this innovative therapeutic approach. Our software system, CoRe, supports a therapist during the administration of rehabilitation sessions: exercises can be generated dynamically, thus reducing repetitivity, and patients' performance trends automatically analysed to facilitate the assessment of their progress. Tests performed on both healthy subjects and patients provided useful information that allowed us to define an implementation strategy able to reduce patients' resistance to computerized rehabilitation as much as possible. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84945315098

Cognitive-behavioural interventions that target specific cognitions related to gaming may be more effective than more general approaches that focus only on preoccupation with games. Although past research has identified cross-sectional associations between maladaptive cognitions and problematic gaming, it is less clear whether these cognitions can predict future changes in problematic gaming behaviour. The present study employed an 18-item measure of gaming cognition, assessing perfectionism, cognitive salience, regret, and behavioural salience, to investigate potential changes in problematic gaming over a 12-month period. The sample included 465 Australian adults (84% male, Mage = 26.2 years). It was found that individuals who became problematic gamers over 12 months had higher baseline scores on perfectionism (d = 1.20), cognitive salience (d = 0.74) and regret (d = 0.69) than those who remained non-problematic gamers. Problematic gamers who became non-problematic gamers had lower baseline perfectionism scores (d = 0.62) than those who remained problematic gamers. Cognitive change accounted for an additional 28% of variance in problematic gaming scores beyond gender, age, and frequency of gaming. These findings suggest that maladaptive gaming-related cognitions could be screened in clinical trials to aid in case formulation and inform decisions on needed interventions to deliver optimal client outcomes. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84993958576

Because the most recent meta-analyses were published in 2010 and reflected work through 2009, the task force conducted a search of the published studies from 2009-2013. These recently published articles were scored and assessed by a systematic evidentiary review, followed by a meta-analysis of the high utility studies, as documented in the evidentiary review. Consistent with the literature that we reviewed, we found that violent video game exposure was associated with: an increased composite aggression score; increased aggressive behavior increased aggressive cognitions; increased aggressive affect, increased desensitization, and decreased empathy and increased physiological arousal. The size of the effects was similar to that in prior meta-analyses, suggesting a stable result.

Some of these skills, working memory, mental rotation, problem solving, are linked to higher performance in science, technology, math, and engineering (STEM) disciplines. In the present study, we examined whether experience in a different activity, hip hop dance, is also linked to cognitive abilities connected with STEM skills as well as social cognition ability. Dancers who varied in hip hop and other dance style experience were presented with a set of computerized tasks that assessed working memory capacity, mental rotation speed, problem solving efficiency, and theory of mind. We found that, when controlling for demographic factors and other dance style experience, those with greater hip hop dance experience were faster at mentally rotating images of hands at greater angle disparities and there was a trend for greater accuracy at identifying positive emotions displayed by cropped images of human faces. We suggest that hip hop dance, similar to other more technical activities such as video gameplay, tap some specific cognitive abilities that underlie STEM skills. Furthermore, we suggest that hip hop dance experience can be used to reach populations who may not otherwise be interested in other kinesthetic or gaming activities and potentially enhance select sociocognitive skills. © 2017 Bonny et al.

From a clinical point of view, it appears that excessive/addictive Internet use is often comorbid with further psychopathologies and assessing comorbidity is relevant in clinical practice, treatment outcome and prevention as the probability to become addicted to using the Internet accelerates with additional (sub)clinical symptoms. Moreover, research indicates individuals play computer games excessively to cope with everyday stressors and to regulate their emotions by applying media-focused coping strategies, suggesting pathological computer game players play in order to relieve stress and to avoid daily hassles. The aims of this research were to replicate and extend previous findings and explanations of the complexities of the relationships between excessive Internet use and Internet addiction, psychopathology and dysfunctional coping strategies. Method: Participants included 681 Polish university students sampled using an online battery of validated psychometric instruments. Results: Results of structural equation models revealed dysfunctional coping strategies (i.e., distraction, denial, self-blame, substance use, venting, media use, and behavioural disengagement) significantly predict excessive Internet use, and the data fit the theoretical model well. A second SEM showed media-focused coping and substance use coping significantly mediate the relationship between psychopathology (operationalised via the Global Severity Index) and excessive Internet use. Conclusions: The findings lend support to the self-medication hypothesis of addictive disorders, and suggest psychopathology and dysfunctional coping have additive effects on excessive Internet use. © 2017 Giovanni Fioriti Editore s.r.l.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85014318858

Whereas, today's radio spectrum is very crowded for rapid increasing popularities of various wireless applications. Hence, wireless sensor networks utilizing the advantages of cognitive radio technology, namely cognitive wireless sensor network (CWSN), is a promising solution for spectrum scarcity problem. A major challenge in CWSN is maximizing its network lifetime by appropriate power control mechanism. To solve the distributed power control issues in CWSN with imperfect information, a game-theoretic power control mechanism based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is proposed according to the difference and independence of channel sensing results among users of cognitive wireless sensor network (UCWSNs). UCWSNs can use HMM to infer whether its competitors take part in the game, which improves the information accuracy of game and leads to an optimal transmission power. Moreover, to meet the QoS (Quality of Service) of UCWSNs for multimedia information, a utility function based on the tradeoff of signal to interference plus noise ratio and power efficiency is defined for the power control game. Simulation results indicate that the game-theoretic power control mechanism based on HMM can not only improve the power efficiency, but also meet the target SINR better compared with other methods. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84994071257

In this study, I investigate the effect of playing violent video games on emotional stress detected by a new methodology: voice analysis. Because changes and disturbances in vocal responses can be understood as reactions to emotional stress, I expected that violent videogames would increase voice stress. Participants (N 87 French university students; 40% female; Mage 21.2) played either a violent or nonviolent game for 20 min. After game play, participants read a stressprovoking story aloud while their voices were recorded. Voice recordings were analyzed to determine the amount of emotional stress in participants' voices using Automated Voice Stress Analysis. As hypothesized, voice stress was higher among violent video game players than among nonviolent video game players. Voice stress was also higher for men than for women.

This article contributes to lowering such barriers by presenting GNomon (Gaming NOMON), a software framework based on the NOMON mode of interaction that allows the creation of action-oriented single-switch video games. The article reports the results of two studies that evaluate the playability and rehabilitation suitability of GNomon-based video games. The playability of GNomon-based games is evaluated by assessing their learnability, effectiveness, errors, satisfaction, memorability, and enjoyability with a group of eight children with severe motor disabilities.The suitability for pediatric rehabilitation is determined by means of a focus group with a team of speech therapists, physiotherapists, and psychologists from a Local Health Agency in Turin, Italy. The results of the playability study are positive: All children had fun playing GNomon-based video games, and seven of eight were able to interact and play autonomously. The results of the rehabilitation-suitability study also entail that GNomon-based games can be exploited in training hand-eye coordination and maintenance of selective attention over time. The article finally offers critical hindsight and reflections and shows possible new future game concepts. © 2017 ACM.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027516758

The research experiment presented here (n 184) aims to fill this gap in the literature by explaining how the immoral actions of a video game character impact the player's feelings of guilt. Specifically, results show that playing as a video game character that has committed immoral actions caused players to feel guilty and ashamed, especially if they felt transported or ""wrapped-up"" in the narrative.

An avatar is a graphical representation of an individual user in a virtual world. Users form judgments of other virtual world users based on the appearance and behavior of their avatars in the absence of physical cues. In particular, users have previously displayed sensitivity toward anthropomorphism and verbal behavior of avatars they encounter within virtual environments. Thus far, investigations of language in online and virtual spaces have been limited to specific contexts. University student participants and Amazon Mechanical Turk workers were shown two avatars. Each pair consisted of two out of three possible appearances: a tiger, a male, or a female. Each avatar was aligned with a different text introduction: one containing words of positive emotional valence and the other of negative emotional valence. Participants from both samples preferred avatars associated with positive language, regardless of appearance, but participants did not ascribe human control of an avatar based on either emotional valance or appearance. Significant differences for reported preferences and likeability demonstrate the salience of emotive language as a social cue even in short text introductions for avatars.

Balance problems are well-established modifiable risk factors for falls, which are common in older adults. The objective of this study was to establish the efficacy of a Wii-Fit interactive video-game-led physical exercise program to improve balance in older Veterans. Methods. A prospective randomized controlled parallel-group trial was conducted at Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Thirty community dwelling Veterans aged 68 (±6.7) years were randomized to either the exercise or control groups. The exercise group performed Wii-Fit program while the control group performed a computer-based cognitive program for 45 minutes, three days per week for 8-weeks. The primary (Berg Balance Scale (BBS)) and secondary outcomes (fear of falling, physical activity enjoyment, and quality of life) were measured at baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks. Results. Of 30 randomized subjects, 27 completed all aspects of the study protocol. There were no study-related adverse events. Intent-to-treat analysis showed a significantly greater improvement in BBS in the exercise group (6.0; 95% CI, 5.1-6.9) compared to the control group (0.5; 95% CI, -0.3-1.3) at 8 weeks (average intergroup difference (95% CI), 5.5 (4.3-6.7), p < 0.001) after adjusting for baseline.

We studied 137 subjects with a family history of hypertension and early myocardial infarction. There were 63 European Americans (EAs) (38 males) and 74 African Americans (AAs) (35 males), aged 19-36 (27.6±3.1). The protocol included a competitive video game, cold stressor and ambulatory BP recording. Blood samples were drawn six times for OS markers (8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and 8-Isoprostane) assay. Repeated measures analyses of covariance were used to test for mean differences and Pearson correlations were used to test OS and BP associations. There were no significant race/ethnicity differences in BP reactivity to either stressor (both P's>0.48). 8-OHdG levels were significantly lower across all time points for AAs than for EAs (P<0.05), while levels of 8-isoprostane did not differ significantly (P>0.10). Averaged 8-OHdG levels significantly correlated with systolic blood pressure (SBP) reactivity (r=0.45, <0.01) and 24-h, daytime and nighttime SBP (r range=0.37-0.42, all P's<0.02) for EAs but not for AAs, whereas 8-isoprostane levels were significantly correlated with reactive SBP and nighttime diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (both r's=0.38, P<0.01) for AAs but not for EAs. These findings suggest a link between OS and BP changes in subjects at high risk for CV disease (CVD).

Research shows that people feel sadness in response to losses but it’s unclear whether sad expressions function to communicate losses to others and if so, what makes these signals credible. Here we use economic games to test the hypothesis that sad expressions lend credibility to claims of loss. Participants play the role of either a proposer or recipient in a game with a fictional backstory and real monetary payoffs. The proposers view a (fictional) video of the recipient’s character displaying either a neutral or sad expression paired with a claim of loss. The proposer then decided how much money to give to the recipient. In three experiments, we test alternative theories by using situations in which the recipient’s losses were uncertain (Experiment 1), the recipient’s losses were certain (Experiment 2), or the recipient claims failed gains rather than losses (Experiment 3). Overall, we find that participants gave more money to recipients who displayed sad expressions compared to neutral expressions, but only under conditions of uncertain loss.

Although MOBA is currently one of the most played genres around the world, it is known as a game that offer less autonomy, more challenges and consequently more frustration. Due to these characteristics, the use of a mechanism that performs the difficulty balance dynamically seems to be an interesting alternative to minimize and/or avoid that players experience such frustrations. In this sense, this paper presents a dynamic difficulty adjustment mechanism for MOBA games. The main idea is to create a computer controlled opponent that adapts dynamically to the player performance, trying to offer to the player a better game experience. This is done by evaluating the performance of the player using a metric based on some game features and switching the difficulty of the opponent's artificial intelligence behavior accordingly. Quantitative and qualitative experiments were performed and the results showed that the system is capable of adapting dynamically to the opponent's skills. In spite of that, the qualitative experiments with users showed that the player's expertise has a greater influence on the perception of the difficulty level and dynamic adaptation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84992477585

Following observations of ethics and public reactions to media, we propose that fictional contexts, such as reality, imagination, and virtual environments, will mitigate people's moral condemnation of harm violations, more so than purity violations. That is, imagining a purely harmful act is given a ""fictive pass,"" in moral judgment, whereas imagining an abnormal act involving the body is evaluated more negatively because it is seen as more diagnostic of bad character. For Experiment 1, an undergraduate sample (N = 250) evaluated 9 vignettes depicting an agent committing either violations of harm or purity in real life, watching them in films, or imagining them. For Experiments 2 and 3, online participants (N = 375 and N = 321, respectively) evaluated a single vignette depicting an agent committing a violation of harm or purity that either occurred in real life, was imagined, watched in a film, or performed in a video game. Experiment 4 (N = 348) used an analysis of moderated mediation to demonstrate that the perceived wrongness of fictional purity violations is explained both by the extent to which they are seen as a cue to, and a cause of, a poor moral character. Lastly, Experiment 5 (N = 484) validated our manipulations and included the presumption of desire as an additional mediator of the fictive pass asymmetry effects.

This can address questions about the features of multimedia users are most engaged and how engaged users are without the need for prescribed interactions or baselining. We assessed the validity of this approach in a psychophysiological study. Forty participants played interactive video games. Intake and post-stimulus questionnaires collected subjective engagement reports that provided convergent and divergent validity criteria to evaluate our approach. Estimates of coherence between physiological variation and in-game contextual events predicted subjective engagement and added information beyond physiological metrics computed from baselines taken outside of the multimedia context. Our coherence metric accounted for task-dependent engagement, independent of predispositions; this was not true of a baselined physiological approach that was used for comparison.

A within-subjects experiment involving 18 participants who played an open-source real-time strategy game was conducted. Three different versions of the game were developed, each with a unique static autonomy level designed from Sheridan and Verplank's 10 levels of autonomy (levels 2, 4, and 9). NASA-TLX subject survey ratings, time to complete run, and visual fixation rate were found to be significantly different among automation levels. These findings suggest that assessing visual physiology may be a promising indicator for evaluating cognitive workload when interacting with static autonomy levels. This efforts takes us one step closer to using visual physiology as a useful method for evaluating operator workload in almost real-time. Relevance to industry Potential applications of this research include development of software that integrates adaptive automation to improve human-computer task performance for high cognitive workload tasks (Air Traffic Control, aircraft piloting, process control, information analyst, etc.). © 2016",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84991615291

This work describes an approach applying a Genetic Programming (GP) algorithm to create the behavioural engine of bots able to play a simple RTS. Normally it is impossible to know in advance what kind of strategies will be the best in the most general case of this problem. So GP, which searches the general decision tree space, has been introduced and used successfully. However, it is not straightforward what fitness function would be the most convenient to guide the evolutionary process in order to reach the best solutions and also being less sensitive to the uncertainty present in the context of games. Thus, in this paper three different evaluation functions have been proposed, and a detailed analysis of their performance has been conducted. The paper also analyses several aspects of the obtained bots, in addition to their final performance on battles, such as the evolution of the decision trees (behavioural models) themselves, or the influence on the results of noise or uncertainty. The results show that a victory-based fitness, which prioritises the number of victories, contributes to generate better bots, on average, than other functions based on other numerical aspects of the battles, such as the number of resources gathered, or the number of units generated. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84986563085

Software-defined network (SDN) is an emergent paradigm that aims to support next-generation networks through its flexible and powerful management mechanisms. One of the biggest threats faced by these services nowadays is security management. Attacks based on the denial of service (DoS) are particularly efficient against this paradigm due to its centralized control characteristic. Once this controlling system receives a massive amount of malicious requests, the overall performance of the network operation is impaired. Although several researches propose to address this problem, most of them are reactive approaches, detecting the attacks and warning the network administrators, i.e., after the network is already compromised. This paper presents an autonomic DoS/DDoS defensive approach for SDNs called Game Theory (GT)-Holt-Winters for Digital Signature (HWDS), which unites the anomaly detection and identification provided by an HWDS system with an autonomous decision-making model based on GT. Real collected data and simulated attacks are used by the system to measure its effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, we also use a heuristic Fuzzy-GADS method for anomaly detection instead of HWDS, aiming to compare the achieved performance and evaluate the behavior of the presented game theoretical approaches a standalone mitigation module. © 2017 IEEE.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85025627122

Imaging revealed evolving end-stage avascular necrosis of lateral sesamoid with early secondary degenerative changes. Previous exhaustive conservative treatment had been unsuccessful in alleviating his pain. As an alternative to surgery, radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy (rESWT) was proposed.

Over the previous decades, space agency efforts have brought forth well-known and immensely useful satellites such as the Landsat series and the Gravity Research and Climate Experiment (GRACE) system, with costs typically of the order of 1 billion dollars per satellite and with concept-to-launch timelines of the order of 2 decades (for new missions). More recently, the proliferation of smartphones has helped to miniaturize sensors and energy requirements, facilitating advances in the use of CubeSats that can be launched by the dozens, while providing ultra-high (3- 5 m) resolution sensing of the Earth on a daily basis. Startup companies that did not exist a decade ago now operate more satellites in orbit than any space agency, and at costs that are a mere fraction of traditional satellite missions. With these advances come new space-borne measurements, such as real-time high-definition video for tracking air pollution, storm-cell development, flood propagation, precipitation monitoring, or even for constructing digital surfaces using structure-from-motion techniques. Closer to the surface, measurements from small unmanned drones and tethered balloons have mapped snow depths, floods, and estimated evaporation at sub-metre resolutions, pushing back on spatio-temporal constraints and delivering new process insights. At ground level, precipitation has been measured using signal attenuation between antennae mounted on cell phone towers, while the proliferation of mobile devices has enabled citizen scientists to catalogue photos of environmental conditions, estimate daily average temperatures from battery state, and sense other hydrologically important variables such as channel depths using commercially available wireless devices. Global internet access is being pursued via highaltitude balloons, solar planes, and hundreds of planned satellite launches, providing a means to exploit the ""internet of things"" as an entirely new measurement domain. Such global access will enable real-time collection of data from billions of smartphones or from remote research platforms. This future will produce petabytes of data that can only be accessed via cloud storage and will require new analytical approaches to interpret. The extent to which today's hydrologic models can usefully ingest such massive data volumes is unclear. Nor is it clear whether this deluge of data will be usefully exploited, either because the measurements are superfluous, inconsistent, not accurate enough, or simply because we lack the capacity to process and analyse them. What is apparent is that the tools and techniques afforded by this array of novel and game-changing sensing platforms present our community with a unique opportunity to develop new insights that advance fundamental aspects of the hydrological sciences. To accomplish this will require more than just an application of the technology: in some cases, it will demand a radical rethink on how we utilize and exploit these new observing systems. © Author(s) 2017.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019592216

Material and methods. In this study, methods were used to determine the psychophysiological abilities of athletes in terms of time indicators of a simple and complex reaction. Tests were conducted on the computer program ""Psychodiagnostics"". The following measurements were made: measurement of the simple reaction rate of the light stimulus; measurement of the simple reaction rate to the sound stimulus; the measurement of the complex reaction of choosing one of three objects; the measurement of the complex reaction of selecting two objects from three; in response to the appearance on the monitor screen of the animal's image should be as soon as possible to press and release the right mouse button. In the study to determine the differences between the reaction rate indicators, swimmers and basketball players were attended by 22 qualified swimmers and 24 qualified basketball players. In determining the comparative evaluation of the indicators of psycho-physiological functions of swimmers of different qualifications, 6 masters of sports and masters of sports of international class in swimming and 10 athletes of the 1st category and candidates for master of sports were used. In determining the comparative evaluation of the indicators of psycho-physiological functions of basketball players of various qualifications, 11 sports masters (athletes of international level) in basketball and 12 athletes of the 1st category and candidates for the master of sports (athletes of regional level) were tested. Results. On the indicators of psycho-physiological testing revealed significant differences between basketball players and swimmers. Qualified basketball players have significantly less time for a simple reaction to a light stimulus, for a sound stimulus, the response time for selecting one element out of three, and the response time for selecting two elements out of three. In swimmers, the time of simple reaction to the light stimulus and the reaction time to the auditory stimulus decrease as the skill level increases. The time of a complex selection reaction is not significantly different in swimmers of different qualifications. This testifies to the importance of psychophysiological abilities not only for representatives of game sports, but also for cyclical ones, for example, for swimming. Basketball players of higher qualification (masters of sports) significantly less time of both simple and complex reactions in comparison with basketball players of the 1st category and candidates for the master of sports. Conclusions. It has been revealed that, in almost all indicators of psychophysiological functions, basketball players are significantly different from swimmers in fins. With the improvement of the swimmers' skills, the time of simple reactions decreases.

Emergent phenomena are considered as either emergent behaviour or emergent strategy. Initially, the Netlogo platform is used to develop a rudimentary agent-based model upon which incremental and systematic changes in agent behaviour rules are imposed to examine the points at which emergent behaviour may be detected. Emergent behaviour is defined as agent- and/or group-level phenomena that are not specifically encoded by the modeller. While emergence may be a behavioural whole of the system that is greater than the sum of its parts, it may manifest at large or small scales, may be a complex or a simple phenomenon, and may be counterintuitive or not. Emergent behaviour begins when the outcomes of a simulation cannot be expressly tied back to the encoded individual agent behavioural rules and profiles. In the second part of this work, an in-house platform is used to explore emergent strategy. Emergent strategy is the view that strategy emerges over time as agents' intentions collide with and accommodate a changing reality. Emergent strategy is a set of actions consistent over time, or a realized pattern which was not expressly intended in the original planning of strategy, i.e., a form of learning that emergences from practice. © 2017 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,"English",Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019596129

One such level is the communication between autonomous systems that is primarily based on border gateway protocol (BGP). In order to understand this impact, a tool was developed to detect the problems that occur during a specific time period. This tool is able to identify and classify flapping events providing information about the networks potentially involved in the disruptions. The main focus of this paper is the analysis of the BGP updates registered during Super Bowl 2016 in order to understand how a large streaming event affects the Internet at the BGP level. Those results show that an increase in the number of updates happened during key times when a large number of concurrent viewers connected to the game. Many dampening and flapping events were observed accordingly. From those events, networks potentially affected were detected and categorized. The results of our study suggest that the Internet is not prepared to accommodate the potential streaming traffic generated during major events.

Therefore, the level of cognitive engagement and the intensity of physical activity were systematically varied across three experimental conditions. Sixty-five healthy male adolescents (13-16 years) were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (a) physical activity with high levels of cognitive engagement during active video gaming, (b) physical activity with low levels of cognitive engagement during active video gaming, (c) sedentary with low levels of cognitive engagement during passive video watching.

Materials and Methods: Thirty-six participants (19 male; 21.7 ± 3.8 years; 23.65 ± 3.17 kg/m2) each completed two 30-minute exergame sessions in a randomized order (single and dual player) while wearing an Actiheart® to estimate energy expenditure. Positive and negative affect, subjective vitality, and indices of intrinsic motivation were assessed directly after each gaming bout. Results: There was no significant difference in energy expenditure or psychosocial outcomes between conditions. Although males expended more energy than females in both single- (z = -2.124, P = 0.033) and dual-player situations (z = -2.679, P = 0.007), females reported significantly greater vitality (z = -2.219, P = 0.026) and effort/importance than males (z = -2.001, P = 0.045). Conversely, males reported a greater negative affect (z = -2.872, P = 0.004) and pressure/tension (z = -3.295, P = 0.001). A linear mixed effects model revealed that energy expenditure during exergaming was a significant predictor of interest and enjoyment (P = 0.001) and effort and importance (P = 0.001). This relationship between energy expenditure and psychosocial variables was not modulated by sex or order of gameplay (single or dual player first).

However, heat generation during implant placement should also be carefully considered. Purpose The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate thermal change in a resin block during motorized and manual implant placement with and without saline irrigation. Material and methods Thermocouple probes were placed in resin blocks to measure the thermal change during forty 3.75x15-mm self-tapping cylindrical screw implant placements as follows: MtI group, 10 motorized implant placements with external saline irrigation; MtNI group, 10 motorized implant placements without irrigation; MI group, 10 manual implant placements with external saline irrigation; MNI group, 10 manual implant placements without irrigation. The temperature values were recorded with a data acquisition system with a 20-channel multiplexer module connected to a personal computer. The normality of data distribution was assessed with the Shapiro-Wilk test and the homogeneity of variances with the Levene test. The mean temperatures of the groups was assessed with the 3-way ANOVA test followed by the Tukey HSD test for normal distribution and the Games-Howell test for non-normal distribution (α=.05). Results The rate of temperature rise in the resin blocks was 1.1°C to 7.3°C. The highest mean temperature was present in the group for manual implant placement without irrigation (26.2 ±1.1°C), and the lowest thermal change was in the motorized implant placement group with external saline irrigation (23.6 ±1.0°C). Conclusions The thermal change in resin blocks during motorized implant placement was lower than manual implant placement, especially with external saline irrigation. © 2016 Editorial Council for the Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84979518949

Age-related neuronal changes, e.g., decline in gray-and white-matter, affect neuronal, cognitive, and motor functioning. The improvement of these factors might decrease fall events in elderly. Studies showed that administration of video game-based physical exercise, a so-called exergame, or omega-3 fatty acid (FA) may improve motor and/or cognitive functioning through neuronal changes in the brain of older adults. The aim of this study is to assess the effects of a combination of exergame training with omega-3 FA supplementation on the elderly brain. We hypothesize that an intervention using a combination approach differently affects on the neuronal structure and function of the elderly's brain as compared to the sole administration of exergame training. The study is a parallel, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial lasting 26 weeks. Sixty autonomous living, non-smoking, and right-handed healthy older (>65 years) adults who live independently or in a senior residency are included, randomized, and allocated to one of two study groups. The experimental group receives a daily amount of 13.5 ml fish oil (including 2.9 g of omega-3 FA), whereas the control group receives a daily amount of 13.5 ml olive oil for 26 weeks. After 16 weeks, both groups start with an exergame training program three times per week. Measurements are performed on three time-points by treatment blinded investigators: pre-intervention measurements, blood sample after 16 week, and post-intervention measurements. The main outcomes are motor evoked potentials of the right M. tibialis anterior (transcranial magnetic stimulation) and response-related potentials (electroencephalography) during a cognitive test. For secondary outcomes, reaction time during cognitive tests and spatio-temporal parameters during gait performance are measured. Statistics will include effect sizes and a 2 × 2-ANOVA with normally distributed data or the non-parametric equivalent for data not fulfilling normal distribution. The randomized controlled study is the first to investigate the effectiveness of exergame training combined with omega-3 FA in counteracting age- and behavioral-dependent neuronal changes in the brain.

Methods: Ten professional futsal players participated in the study (age: 22.2 ± 2.5 years) and initially performed an incremental protocol to determine maximum oxygen uptake (V.O2max: 50.6 ± 4.9 mL.kg-1.min-1). Next, simulated games were performed, in four periods of 10 min during which heart rate and blood lactate concentration were monitored. The entire games were video recorded for subsequent automatic tracking. Before and immediately after the simulated game, neuromuscular function was measured by maximal isometric force of knee extension, voluntary activation using twitch interpolation technique, and electromyographic activity. Before, at half time, and immediately after the simulated game, the athletes also performed a set of finishing kicks for ball speed and accuracy measurements. Results: Total distance covered (1st half: 1986.6 ± 74.4 m; 2nd half: 1856.0 ± 129.7 m, P = 0.00) and distance covered per minute (1st half: 103.2 ± 4.4 m.min-1; 2nd half: 96.4 ± 7.5 m.min-1, P = 0.00) demonstrated significant declines during the simulated game, as well as maximal isometric force of knee extension (Before: 840.2 ± 66.2 N; After: 751.6 ± 114.3 N, P = 0.04) and voluntary activation (Before: 85.9 ± 7.5%; After: 74.1 ± 12.3%, P = 0.04), however ball speed and accuracy during the finishing kicks were not significantly affected. Conclusion: Therefore, we conclude that despite the decline in running performance and neuromuscular variables presenting an important manifestation of central fatigue, this condition apparently does not affect the speed and accuracy of finishing kicks. © 2016 Milioni, Vieira, Barbieri, Zagatto, Nordsborg, Barbieri, dos-Santos, Santiago and Papoti.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85006515952

This study aimed to identify differences in autonomic functions and distressed (type D) personality traits among Korean adolescent males with and without IGA. In a cross-sectional study, 68 adolescent males were recruited in a Korean city using convenience and snowball sampling methods. For each subject, heart rate variability (HRV) parameters were measured as autonomic functions and questionnaires were used to identify IGA and type D personality traits. Data were analyzed using descriptive analyses, t tests, χ2 tests, and Pearson's correlation. Most HRV parameters significantly differed between the IGA and non-IGA groups (all p &lt; 0.05). Type D personality total and subscale scores, including those for negative affectivity (NA) and social inhibition, were significantly higher in the IGA group (all p &lt; 0.001). Of the 68 subjects, 46 were classified as having type D personality, with nearly twice as many in the IGA group as in the non-IGA group (p = 0.002). Type D personality total scores negatively correlated with the logarithmic value of total power and low frequency among the HRV parameters (both p &lt; 0.05).

This is a trend best exemplified in sexagenarian actress Helen Mirren’s endorsement of Nintendo’s fitness-themed game Wii Fit Plus. In one sense, ‘health-entertainment’ is deemed a product of the coercive laws of competition that impress the need for reinvestment and innovation as a way of warding off industry rivals. Nintendo’s turn to health promotion is from this perspective an extension of the ‘console wars’ that in the past drove gaming companies to pursue verisimilitude on screen in hopes of attracting (young male) consumers. In another sense, the present moment offers an ideal time to direct innovation towards the issues of health and healthy ageing in particular, as the cultural logics of healthism and the ‘third age’ both emphasise the virtues of ‘healthy’ and autonomous consumer activity. As such, Nintendo has pursued aesthetic simplicity but kinaesthetic realism as a way of extending the appeal of video gaming beyond the male youth demographic. In examining the implications of these developments, it is argued that health and entertainment, as independent constructs, are conceptually reimagined through their integration with one another. The pursuit of entertainment is made ‘responsible’, thereby remedying the concern that video gaming is an unhealthy activity. The pursuit of health, meanwhile, becomes a matter of playful, technology-enhanced and ultimately consumption-based experience. © 2014 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84916624087

While many researchers have, in the past, focused on the affective evaluation of passive environments, such as listening to music or the observation of videos and imagery, virtual realities and related interactive environments have been used in only a small number of research studies as a mean of presenting emotional stimuli. This article reports the first stage (focusing on participants’ subjective responses) of a range of experimental investigations supporting the evaluation of emotional responses within a virtual environment, according to a three-dimensional (Valence, Arousal, and Dominance) model of affects, developed in the 1970s and 1980s. To populate this three-dimensional model with participants’ emotional responses, an “affective VR,” capable of manipulating users’ emotions, has been designed and subjectively evaluated. The VR takes the form of a dynamic “speedboat” simulation, elements (controllable VR parameters) of which were assessed and selected based on a 35-respondent online survey, coupled with the implementation of an affective power approximation algorithm. A further 68 participants took part in a series of trials, interacting with a number of VR variations, while subjectively rating their emotional responses. The experimental results provide an early level of confidence that this particular affective VR is capable of manipulating individuals’ emotional experiences, through the control of its internal parameters. Moreover, the approximation technique proved to be fairly reliable in predicting users’ potential emotional responses, in various affective VR settings, prior to actual experiences. Finally, the analysis suggested that the emotional response of the users, with different gender and gaming experiences, could vary, when presented with the same affective VR situation. © 2016 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84995542938

Methods A representative sample of 20,122 Canadian youth in Grades 6–10 was studied. The exposure variables were average hours/day spent playing AVGs, SVGs, and AOP. The outcomes consisted of a negative and internalizing mental health indicator (emotional problems), a positive and internalizing mental health indicator (life satisfaction), and a positive and externalizing mental health indicator (prosocial behavior). Isotemporal substitution models estimated the extent to which replacing time spent in SVGs and AOP with an equivalent amount of time in AVGs had on the mental health indicators. Results Replacing 1 hour/day of SVGs with 1 hour/day of AVGs was associated with a 6% (95% confidence interval: 3%–9%) reduced probability of high emotional problems, a 4% (2%–7%) increased probability of high life satisfaction, and a 13% (9%–16%) increased probability of high prosocial behavior. Replacing 1 hour/day of AOP with 1 hour/day of AVGs was associated with a 7% (3%–11%) increased probability of high emotional problems, a 3% (1%–5%) reduced probability of high life satisfaction, and a 6% (2%–9%) reduced probability of high prosocial behavior. Conclusions Replacing SVGs with AVGs was associated with more preferable mental health indicators. Conversely, replacing AOP with AVGs was associated with more deleterious mental health indicators. © 2016 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84994173310

Methods: Computerized time-motion analysis, heart rate (HR), and blood lactate concentration [La-] were measured in 15 referees during 8 competitive games (under-19-y-old Tunisian league). Referees also performed a repeated-sprint test (RSA), Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Test level 1 (YYIRTL1), agility T-test, and 30-m sprint with 10-m lap time. Computerized video analysis determined the time spent in 5 locomotor activities (standing, walking, jogging, running, and sprint), then grouped in high-, moderate-, and low-intensity activities (HIAs, MIAs, and LIAs, respectively). Results: YYIRTL1 performance correlated with (1) total distance covered during the 4th quarter (r =.52, P =.04) and (2) distance covered in LIA during all game periods (P &lt;.05). Both distance covered and time spent in MIA during the 1st quarter were negatively correlated with the YYIRTL1 performance (r = -.53, P =.035; r = -.67, P =.004, respectively). A negative correlation was found between distance covered at HIA during the 2nd half (3rd quarter + 4th quarter) and fatigue index of the RSA test (r = -.54, P =.029). Mean HR (expressed as %HRpeak) during all game periods was correlated with YYIRTL1 performance (.61 ≤ r &lt;.67, P &lt;.01). Conclusions: This study showed that (1) the YYIRTL1 performance is a moderate predictor of game physical performance in U-19 basketball referees and (2) referees' RSA correlates with the amount of HIA performed during the 2nd half, which represents the ability to keep up with play. © 2016 Human Kinetics, Inc.",26868894,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85008226631

Participants played 15-min 5-vs-5 small-sided games (SSGs) without goalkeepers on 2 occasions separated by 1 wk. Before the SSG, 1 team watched a 30-min emotionally neutral documentary (control), while the other performed 30 min of a computer-based Stroop task (mental fatigue). Subjective ratings of mental and physical fatigue were recorded before and after treatment and after the SSG. Motivation was assessed before treatment and SSG; mental effort was assessed after treatment and SSG. Player activity profiles and heart rate (HR) were measured throughout the SSG, whereas ratings of perceived exertion (RPEs) were recorded before the SSG and immediately after each half. Video recordings of the SSG allowed for notational analysis of technical variables. Results: Subjective ratings of mental fatigue and effort were higher after the Stroop task, whereas motivation for the upcoming SSG was similar between conditions. HR during the SSG was possibly higher in the control condition, whereas RPE was likely higher in the mental-fatigue condition. Mental fatigue had an unclear effect on most physical-performance variables but impaired most technical-performance variables.

Here, five classical planners were connected to the virtual environment of Unreal Development Kit along with a planner for delete-free domains (only positive preconditions and positive effects). Performance of IVAs employing those planners and IVAs with reactive architecture was measured on a class of game-inspired test environments of various sizes and under different levels of external interference. The analysis has shown that planning agents outperform reactive agents if (i) the size of the problem is small or if (b) the environment changes are either hostile to the agent or infrequent. In delete-free domains, specialized approaches are inferior to classical planners because the lower expressivity of delete-free domains results in lower plan quality. These results can help to determine when planning is advantageous in games and for IVAs control in other dynamic real-time environments. ©2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84952684817

Pupils' performance in a knowledge test improved after the visit. Autonomous motivation and attitudes towards science predicted situation motivation awakened in the science exhibition. Interestingly, the scientist attitude and the societal attitude were clearly separate dimensions. The third dimension was manifested in the engineering attitude typical for boys, who were keener on working with appliances, designing computer games and animations.

This often comes at a cost to the task (e.g., slower responding). The neural basis for this behavioral distraction effect is not well understood and is subject of this study. Our approach was motivated by findings from cuing paradigms suggesting a link between modulations in oscillatory activity and voluntary attention shifts. The current study tested whether oscillatory activity is also modulated by a task-irrelevant auditory distractor, reflecting a neural signature of an involuntary shift of attention and accounting for the impaired task performance. We reanalyzed magnetoencephalographic data collected via an auditory-visual distraction paradigm in which a task-relevant visual stimulus was preceded by a task-irrelevant sound on each trial. In 87.5% this was a regular sound (Standard); in 12.5% this was a novel sound (Distractor). We compared nonphase locked oscillatory activity in a time window prior to the visual target as a function of the experimental manipulation (Distractor, Standard). We found low power in the pretarget time window for Distractors compared to Standards in the alpha and beta frequency bands. Importantly, individual alpha power correlated with response speed on a trial-by-trial basis for the Distractor only. Sources were localized to the occipital cortex, and also to the parietal and supratemporal cortices. These findings support our hypothesis that the distractor-related alpha power modulation indexes an involuntary shift of attention which accounts for the impaired task performance. © 2016 Society for Psychophysiological Research.",27468982,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028273116

While conceptual analyses and empirical research unequivocally stressed the importance of immersion through sensory input, agent-related aspects such as mental beliefs received less attention. We are the first to examine the separate and combined effects of being exposed to the smell of a particular stimulus and/or having a representation of this stimulus in mind. Blood was considered to be interesting to work with, because of widespread folk ideas about its capacity to induce aggression in violent contexts. Using a violent computer game in a between-subjects design, male subjects were tested for the immersive impact of blood, first as an olfactory cue, and second as a mental belief, i.e. the true or false belief that one is smelling 'blood'. Lower skin conductance and game scores showed that 'blood' served as a distractor hindering the subject's spontaneous engagement.

Subjects completed 10 minutes running on the treadmill at a self selected pace followed by 10 minutes of Free Run on the Nintendo Wii Fit disc. A metronome regulated the running pace during the Free Run activity to match the running pace on the treadmill. Oxygen consumption, caloric expenditure and heart rate were measured with a Cardio Coach Metabolic Cart. Paired t-tests compared the percentage of age predicted maximal oxygen consumption (% Vo2max), metabolic equivalents (MeTs), caloric expenditure and percentage of estimated maximal heart rate (% hrmax) between the two running situations. RESULTS: For all variables of interest the mean values for treadmill running was found to be signifcantly higher than those for the Wii Free Run (P<0.001). The mean %HRmax and MeTs categorized both activities as vigorous intensity, however, the free run was at the lower end of the ranges whilst treadmill running was at the upper.

Previous studies have shown increased autonomy during practice leads to superior retention of motor skills, but it is not clear why this benefit occurs. Some studies suggest this benefit arises from increased motivation during practice; others suggest the benefit arises from better information processing. Sixty novice participants were randomly assigned to a self-controlled group, who chose the progression of difficulty during practice, or to a yoked group, who experienced the same difficulty progression but did not have choice. At the end of practice, participants completed surveys measuring intrinsic motivation and engagement. One week later, participants returned for a series of retention tests at three different difficulty levels. RM-ANCOVA (controlling for pre-test) showed that the self-controlled group had improved retention compared to the yoked group, on average, β = 46.78, 95% CI = [2.68, 90.87], p = 0.04, but this difference was only statistically significant on the moderate difficulty post-test (p = 0.004). The self-controlled group also showed greater intrinsic motivation during practice, t(58) = 2.61, p = 0.01. However, there was no evidence that individual differences in engagement (p = 0.20) or motivation (p = 0.87) were associated with learning, which was the relationship this experiment was powered to detect. These data are inconsistent with strictly motivational accounts of how autonomy benefits learning, instead suggesting the benefits of autonomy may be mediated through other mechanisms. For instance, within the information processing framework, the learning benefits may emerge from learners appropriately adjusting difficulty to maintain an appropriate level of challenge (i.e., maintaining the relationship between task demands and cognitive resources). © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",27551820,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84989352472

Used extensively in the production of movies and computer games, current techniques for visual speech animation are slow, laborious, and expensive. Therefore, efforts to automate the complex processes involved are of great interest to these multibillion-dollar industries. In this article, the authors describe a method for transforming speech animation between different emotional expressions. When the same sentence is spoken in two different expressive styles, a large proportion of the two sentences is the same. Intuitively, then, after factoring out timing differences, the residual is the expression. Based on earlier work showing two general categories of facial movements in expressive speech-high-frequency speech components (the content) and low-frequency expressive components (the style)-the authors use independent component analysis (ICA) to factorize these movements and show how the energy for different speaking styles is distributed in this space. They transform speaking style by projecting novel animation curves into the low-dimensional ICA space, redistributing the energy in the independent components, and reconstructing the animation by inverting the projection. As they describe, a single ICA model can be used for factoring multiple expressive styles, and their method works on a variety of data types. Evaluations show that viewers can identify the expressive style generated and have difficulty distinguishing transformed animation from ground truth. Finally, they show how their technique can be used to represent complex blends of expression. © 2016 IEEE.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84997241526

However long-term androgen deprivation may induce androgen-independent (AI) recurrence. Intermittent androgen suppression (IAS) is a potential way to delay or avoid the AI relapse. Mathematical models of tumor growth and treatment are simple while they are capable of capturing the essence of complicated interactions. Game theory models have analyzed that tumor cells can enhance their fitness by adopting genetically determined survival strategies. In this paper, we consider the survival strategies as the competitive advantage of tumor cells and propose a new model to mimic the prostate tumor growth in IAS therapy. Then we investigate the competition effect in tumor development by numerical simulations. The results indicate that successfully IAS-controlled states can be achieved even though the net growth rate of AI cells is positive for any androgen level. There is crucial difference between the previous models and the new one in the phase diagram of successful and unsuccessful tumor control by IAS administration, which means that the suggestions from the models for medication can be different. Furthermore we introduce quadratic logistic terms to the competition model to simulate the tumor growth in the environment with a finite carrying capacity considering the nutrients or inhibitors. The simulations show that the tumor growth can reach an equilibrium state or an oscillatory state with the net growth rate of AI cells being androgen independent. Our results suggest that the competition and the restraint of a limited environment can enhance the possibility of relapse prevention. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",27259386,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84971283822

The tradeoff of navigator gating is reduced scan efficiency, particularly when the patient's breathing patterns are inconsistent, as is commonly seen in children. We hypothesized that engaging pediatric participants with a navigator-controlled videogame to help control breathing patterns would improve navigator efficiency and maintain image quality. Methods: We developed custom software that processed the Siemens respiratory navigator image in real-time during CMR and represented diaphragm position using a cartoon avatar, which was projected to the participant in the scanner as visual feedback. The game incentivized children to breathe such that the avatar was positioned within the navigator acceptance window (±3 mm) throughout image acquisition. Using a 3T Siemens Tim Trio, 50 children (Age: 14 ± 3 years, 48 % female) with no significant past medical history underwent a respiratory navigator-gated 2D spiral cine displacement encoding with stimulated echoes (DENSE) CMR acquisition first with no feedback (NF) and then with the feedback game (FG). Thirty of the 50 children were randomized to undergo extensive off-scanner training with the FG using a MRI simulator, or no off-scanner training. Navigator efficiency, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and global left-ventricular strains were determined for each participant and compared. Results: Using the FG improved average navigator efficiency from 33 ± 15 to 58 ± 13 % (p < 0.001) and improved SNR by 5 % (p = 0.01) compared to acquisitions with NF. There was no difference in navigator efficiency (p = 0.90) or SNR (p = 0.77) between untrained and trained participants for FG acquisitions. Circumferential and radial strains derived from FG acquisitions were slightly reduced compared to NF acquisitions (-16 ± 2 % vs -17 ± 2 %, p < 0.001; 40 ± 10 % vs 44 ± 11 %, p = 0.005, respectively). There were no differences in longitudinal strain (p = 0.38). Conclusions: Use of a respiratory navigator feedback game during navigator-gated CMR improved navigator efficiency in children from 33 to 58 %.

For increased social network use, a few existing studies suggest striatal-related positive social feedback as an underlying factor. However, whether an impaired self-concept and its reward-based compensation through the online presentation of an idealized version of the self are related to pathological social network use has not been investigated yet. We aimed to compare different stages of pathological Internet game and social network use to explore the neural basis of avatar and self-identification in addictive use. Methods: About 19 pathological Internet gamers, 19 pathological social network users, and 19 healthy controls underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while completing a self-retrieval paradigm, asking participants to rate the degree to which various self-concept-related characteristics described their self, ideal, and avatar. Self-conceptrelated characteristics were also psychometrically assessed. Results: Psychometric testing indicated that pathological Internet gamers exhibited higher self-concept deficits generally, whereas pathological social network users exhibit deficits in emotion regulation only. We observed left AG hyperactivations in Internet gamers during avatar reflection and a correlation with symptom severity. Striatal hypoactivations during self-reflection (vs. ideal reflection) were observed in social network users and were correlated with symptom severity. Discussion and conclusion: Internet gaming addiction appears to be linked to increased identification with one's avatar, evidenced by high left AG activations in pathological Internet gamers.

Although reinforcement learning (RL) has been a promising approach to creating the behavior models of non-player characters (NPC), an initial stage of exploration and low performance is typically required. On the other hand, imitative learning (IL) is an effective approach to pre-building a NPC's behavior model by observing the opponent's actions, but learning by imitation limits the agent's performance to that of its opponents. In view of their complementary strengths, this paper proposes a computational model unifying the two learning paradigms based on a class of self-organizing neural networks called Fusion Architecture for Learning and COgnition (FALCON). Specifically, two hybrid learning strategies, known as the Dual-Stage Learning (DSL) and the Mixed Model Learning (MML), are presented to realize the integration of the two distinct learning paradigms in one framework. The DSL and MML strategies have been applied to creating autonomous non-player characters (NPCs) in a first person shooting game named Unreal Tournament. Our experiments show that both DSL and MML are effective in producing NPCs with faster learning speed and better combat performance comparing with those built by traditional RL and IL methods. The proposed hybrid learning strategies thus provide an efficient method to building intelligent NPC agents in games and pave the way towards building autonomous expert and intelligent systems for other applications. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We design provably correct continuous-time algorithms to find each of these classes of outcomes in a distributed way. Our algorithmic design to find Nash bargaining solutions builds on the other two algorithms by having the dynamics for finding stable outcomes feeding into the one for finding balanced ones.

Such discrepancy may arise from the intention behind the threat: unintentionally introduced punishment threat facilitates, whereas intentionally introduced punishment threat hinders, norm compliance. Here, we combined a dictator game and fMRI to investigate how intention modulates the effect of punishment threat on norm compliance and the neural substrates of this modulation. Wealso investigated whether this modulation can be influenced by brain stimulation. Humanparticipants divided an amount of money between themselves and a partner. The partner (intentionally) or a computer program (unintentionally) decided to retain or waive the right to punish the participant upon selfish distribution. Compared with the unintentional condition, participants allocated more when the partner intentionally waived the power of punishment, but less when the partner retained such power. The right lateral orbitofrontal cortex (rLOFC) showed higher activation when the partner waived compared with when the computer waived or when the partner retained the power. The functional connectivity between the rLOFC and the brain network associated with intention/mentalizing processing was predictive of the allocation difference induced by intention. Moreover, inhibition or activation of the rLOFC by brain stimulation decreased or increased, respectively, the participants’ reliance on the partner’s intention during monetary allocation.

Impairments in behavioral flexibility are commonly observed in psychiatric disorders including those of addiction. This study investigates two distinct facets of compulsivity, namely reversal learning and attentional set shifting, implicating orbitofrontal and lateral prefrontal regions respectively, across disorders of primary and secondary rewards. Obese subjects with and without binge eating disorder (BED), individuals with compulsive sexual behaviors (CSB), alcohol dependence (AD) and pathological video-gaming (VG) were tested with two computerized tasks: the probabilistic reversal task (trials to criterion and win-stay/lose-shift errors) and the intra/extra-dimensional set shift task (IED). Individuals with AD and pathological VG were slower at reversal learning irrespective of valence, with AD subjects more likely to perseverate after losses. Compared to obese subjects without BED, BED subjects were worse at reversal learning to wins but better at losses highlighting valence effects as a function of binge eating. CSB subjects demonstrated enhanced sensitivity to reward outcomes with faster acquisition and greater perseveration with higher magnitude rewards. We further show an impairment in attentional set shifting in individuals with BED and AD relative to healthy volunteers (HV). This study provides evidence for commonalities and differences in two distinct dimensions of behavioral inflexibility across disorders of compulsivity. We summarize studies on compulsivity subtypes within this same patient population. We emphasize commonalities in AD and BED with impairments across a range of compulsivity indices, perhaps supporting pathological binge eating as a form of behavioral addiction. We further emphasize commonalities in reversal learning across disorders and the crucial role of valence effects.

Yet excessive playing of video games has become a problem in modern society and is manifesting itself in treatment centers for adolescents. Before attempting to gain insight into this problematic use, we must understand video gaming itself and its implications for the gamer. The aim of this research is to propose an understanding of video-game playing based on some dimensions of emotional functioning such as emotion regulation, emotion intensity, emotion expression, and alexithymia. A total of 159 adolescents took part in the study. Regular gamers regulated their emotions more than irregular gamers did. They also felt their emotions more intensely. But regular gamers expressed their emotions less than irregular gamers did. Finally, the regular gamers' alexithymia level was higher than the irregular gamers' level. Especially, they had more difficulty being emotionally reactive. The avatar's evolution in the virtual environment may help mediate adolescents' problematic emotional experiences to give them meaning and enable their appropriation. As such, video games may act as a medium for projecting and experiencing one's emotional life by staging the emotional self, thereby explaining the engagement of adolescents in video gaming. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Given the presence of modeling uncertainties, the unavailability of the model, the possibility of cooperative/noncooperative goals, and malicious attacks compromising the security of networked teams, there is a need for completely model-free plug-and-play approaches that respond to situations not programmed or anticipated in the design, so as to guarantee mission completion. We will be inspired by the prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia of the human brain and will combine interdisciplinary ideas from different fields (ie, computational intelligence, game theory, control theory, and information theory) to develop new self-configuring algorithms for decision and control given the unavailability of a model, the presence of enemy components, and the possibility of actuation and jamming network attacks. Because of the adaptive nature of the algorithms, the systems will be capable of breaking or splitting into parts that are themselves autonomous and resilient. The algorithms will be characterized by strong abilities of self-learning and adaptivity and will be implemented locally, and not globally, which implies that fewer sensors will be used for measurements.

E-cardiology, e-health and technology solutions for physical activity uptake and monitoring have evolved rapidly and have potential in CVD management. However, it is unclear what the current technology usage is of CVD patients, and their needs and interests for technology enabled CR. Methods: A technology usage questionnaire was developed and completed by patients from a supervised ambulatory CR program and an adult congenital heart disease clinic and from two community-based CR programs. Results were described and related with age, gender and educational level by Spearman correlations. Results: Of 310 patients, 298 patients (77 % male; mean age 61,7 ± 14,5 years) completed at least 25 questions of the survey and were included in the analysis (completion rate 96 %). Most (97 %) patients had a mobile phone and used the internet (91 %). Heart rate monitors were used by 35 % and 68 % reported to find heart rate monitoring important when exercising at home. Physical activity monitoring was reported by 12 % of the respondents. Respondents were interested in CR support through internet (77 %) and mobile phone (68 %).

The increasing number of heterogeneous objects that the IoT has to manage introduces crucial scalability issues that still need appropriate solutions. In this respect, one promising proposal is the Social IoT (SIoT) paradigm, whose main principle is to enable objects to autonomously establish social links with each other (adhering to rules set by their owners). ""Friend"" objects exchange data in a distributed manner and this avoids centralized solutions to implement major functions, such as: node discovery, information search, and trustworthiness management. However, the number and types of established friendships affect network navigability. This issue is the focus of this paper, which proposes an efficient, distributed and dynamic solution for the objects to select the right friends for the benefit of the overall network connectivity. The proposed friendship selection mechanism relies on a game theoretic model and a Shapley-value based algorithm. Two different utility functions are defined and evaluated based on either a group degree centrality and an average local clustering parameter. The comparison in terms of global navigability is measured in terms of average path length for the interconnection of any couple of nodes in the network.

The case study explores how different forms of motivation affect the students’ response to challenges and their intention to complete the project. Earlier studies have made little explicit use of theoretical perspectives on student autonomy and motivation, a weakness this study attempts to address. As an exploratory case study seeking to evaluate the suitability of a particular theoretical framework, we chose a small case: three students on a one-term computer games development project. Given the small scale, the approach is necessarily qualitative, drawing on project documentation and one-to-one interviews with the students. Our conclusion is that the concepts of SDT provide a useful framework for analysing students’ motivations to undertake project work, and its predictions can offer useful guidance on how to initiate and supervise such projects. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84980360578

However, existing research has focused on a relatively narrow range of responses to violent games in experimental settings. This limits our understanding of whether and how violent game-induced responses relate to aggression in real life. To address these gaps, this study investigated how cognitive effort, emotional valence, and arousal in response to violent games relate to early adolescents' aggression, both cross-sectionally and over a period of one year. In addition, we investigated how a social context variable (i.e., family conflict) predicts these responses to violent games and subsequent aggression. A sample of 448 early adolescents (10-14 years) completed survey questions and media diaries that measured their responses to violent games. Results showed that, outside the lab, a positive cross-sectional relationship between violent game-induced arousal and aggression exists. In addition, arousal mediated the relationship between family conflict and aggression. Study findings justify increased research attention to media responses outside the lab and a need for further theoretical and methodological refinement. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The challenge is to identify suitable applications from the thousands that are currently available, and familiarity, where an app is a digital version of an existing real world game, may be one solution. Objectives To evaluate the concept of familiarity in gameplay with people living with dementia by comparing a known game with a novel game and measuring whether users are able to play these games independently and whether they enjoy doing so. Methods Thirty older adults living with dementia were recruited from local care services. Each participant was assigned to one of two groups. Group 1 played a familiar game (Solitaire) and Group 2 played a novel game (Bubble Xplode). Each participant played the same game on three separate occasions within one week. Number of gameplay attempts, whether a checkpoint was reached and how much time to reach the checkpoint were measured. A brief post-session interview was conducted to assess the participants’ enjoyment. Results Ninety percent of participants attempted gameplay independently with 17% of participants in the familiar group reaching the checkpoint compared with 93% playing the novel game. Regardless of which game was played or whether the checkpoint was reached, 88% of all participants reported enjoyment of the gaming sessions. Discussion People living with dementia can play touchscreen games independently, but familiarity does not ensure successful gameplay. Enjoyment appears to be independent of progression through a game. The potential of novel and unfamiliar games as meaningful activities that people with dementia can engage with independently should be further explored. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd",26897552,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84958214240

Design: Experimental cross-sectional study. Setting: Controlled laboratory. Participants: Twelve type 2 diabetic patients (10 male and 2 female; age, 60.2 ± 7.7 years; body mass index, 30.9 ± 6.2 kg/m2). Interventions: At baseline, all participants underwent an all-out cardiopulmonary exercise test on a treadmill to assess peak and average oxygen consumption (Vo2 peak and Vo2 mean). Forty-eight to 72 hours after the cardiopulmonary exercise test, the same parameters were assessed during three 10-minute bouts of Wii Fit Plus exergaming and converted to percentage of treadmill Vo2 peak (%Vo2 peak). Main Outcome Measures: Vo2 peak and Vo2 mean during Wii Fit Plus play relative to Vo2 peak achieved during the cardiopulmonary exercise test. Results: All Wii Fit Plus exercises generated a Vo2 peak of around 60% and Vo2 mean of around 40% of the Vo2 peak as established during the cardiopulmonary exercise test. Mean heart rate and resting energy expenditure (respiratory exchange ratio) lay in a range of moderate aerobic exercise. A moderate-to-strong correlation between treadmill Vo2 peak and both exergame Vo2 peak and exergame Vo2 mean was found. Conclusions: Video gaming has the potential to offer training intensities that concur with established guidelines for type 2 diabetic patients. The training intensity is self-adjusting based on fitness level allowing for an effective workout for different users. Copyright © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

In eating disorder patients, impairments in facial emotion recognition have been associated with eating psychopathology severity. Little research however has been carried out on how bulimic spectrum disorder (BSD) patients spontaneously express emotions. Our aim was to investigate emotion expression in BSD patients and to explore the influence of personality traits. Our study comprised 28 BSD women and 15 healthy controls. Facial expressions were recorded while participants played a serious video game. Expressions of anger and joy were used as outcome measures. Overall, BSD participants displayed less facial expressiveness than controls. Among BSD women, expressions of joy were positively associated with reward dependence, novelty seeking and self-directedness, whereas expressions of anger were associated with lower self-directedness. Our findings suggest that specific personality traits are associated with altered emotion facial expression in patients with BSD.

Methods: 92 children (aged from 8 a to 14 a) diagnosed as unilateral hyperopic anisometropic amblyopia in the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University from 2007 to 2013 were include in this prospective random controlled study. All patients were divided into three groups and treated with different therapeutic method: occlusion (group A), combination of occlusion and video game (group B), and combination of occlusion, video game and heat-sensitive moxibustion (group C). After 60 days treatment, all cases were received therapy with red light flicker, luster, light brush for 120 days at home. All treatments were finished until 180 days later. In addition, visual acuity assay and visual evoked potentials (VEP) were used in all case at pre-therapy and 20 d, 40 d, 60 d, 180 d of post-therapy during the period of treatment. Results: There were no significant differences in age, course and visual acuity in three groups (F=1.88, 0.82, 0.38; P>0.05). After 60 days treatment, the visual acuity of all case in three groups were increased. The BCVA (The best-corrected visual acuity) of patients in group B and group C were higher than that of patients in group A at every time point (P<0.05). After 180 days treatment, BCVA was improved from baseline by an average of 1.07 lines in the group A, 2.83 lines in the group B and 5.86 lines in the group C. Comparing with the latency of P100 of VEP elicited by reversing checkerboard with different spatial frequencies in case before treatment, the latency of P100 of VEP were shortened significantly in three groups at 180 d. Besides, the latency of P100 of VEP elicited in group C were less shorter than other case in group A and B [4 period/radian, t=11.62, P<0.05; 8 period/radian, t=9.68, P<0.05].

Existing evidence suggests that AVGs are able to increase EE above rest and when compared with playing passive videogames. However, the association between body movement and EE remains unclear. Furthermore, for goal-directed game design, it is important to know the contribution of body segments to EE. This knowledge will help to acquire a certain level of exercise intensity during active gaming. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the best predictors of EE from body segment energies, acceleration, and heart rate during different game situations. Materials and Methods: EE and body segment movement of 17 subjects, aged 22.1 ± 2.5 years, were measured in two different AVGs. In randomized order, the subjects played a handheld-controlled Nintendo® Wii™ tennis (NWT) game and a whole body-controlled Sony EyeToy® waterfall (ETW) game. Body segment movement was analyzed using a three-dimensional motion capture system. From the video data, mean values of mechanical energy change and acceleration of 10 body segments were analyzed. Results: Measured EE was significantly higher in ETW (7.8 ± 1.4 metabolic equivalents [METs]) than in NWT (3.4 ± 1.0 METs). The best prediction parameter for the more intense ETW game was the energy change of the right thigh and for the less intense hand-controlled NWT game was the energy change of the upper torso. Segment acceleration was less accurate in predicting EE. Conclusion: The best predictors of metabolic EE were the thighs and the upper torso in whole body and handheld-controlled games, respectively. Increasing movement of these body segments would lead to higher physical activity intensity during gaming, reducing sedentary behavior. © Copyright 2016, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016.",27310480,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84987909400

The purpose of this study was to identify the effectiveness of an AVG on elementary school students' science knowledge learning, physical activity (PA) level, and interest-based motivation. Methods: In this randomized controlled study, 53 elementary school students were assigned to an experimental condition or a comparison condition. The experimental condition provided an AVG learning environment, whereas the comparison condition was based on sedentary educational video games. Results: The results of repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) on the knowledge test showed that students in both groups performed better on the post-test than they did on the pre-test (p &lt; 0.001, η2 = 0.486), and their post-test scores did not differ significantly. The experimental condition provided a more active environment since the students' average heart rates (HRs) were in the Target-Heart-Rate-Zone (HR = 134 bpm), which was significantly higher than the average HR (103 bpm) from the comparison condition (t = 7.212, p &lt; 0.001).

Methods: We recruited 30 males with IGD and 30 controls and evaluated their FC using functional magnetic imaging scanning under resting, a state with relaxation, closed eyes, with inducement to think of nothing systematically, become motionless, and instructed not to fall asleep. Results: Subjects with IGD had a lower FC with the left insula over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and orbital frontal lobe and a higher FC with the insula with the contralateral insula than controls. The inter-hemispheric insula connectivity positively correlated with impulsivity. Further, they had lower FC with the left nucleus accumbens over the left DLPFC and with the right nucleus accumbens over the left DLPFC, and insula and a higher FC with that over the right precuneus. Conclusion: The elevated inter-hemispheric insula FC is found to be associated with impulsivity and might explain why it is involved in IGD.

The current study aimed to examine whether the playfulness may influence the antidepressant effect of exergames on older adults. Method: Two experimental conditions, high playfulness (Wii™ Sport games) and low playfulness (Wii Fit™ training), were implemented in a 6-week randomized controlled study. A manipulation check was conducted first to confirm the significant difference in playfulness between the two conditions. A total of 49 community-dwelling older adults diagnosed with subthreshold depression have finished the study. Their depression, positive emotions, and self-efficacy were measured at both pre- and post-test. A multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) was then conducted between two conditions, with age and gender as the covariates.

Previous research methods based on the use of a keyboard or mouse button, eye blinking, and the dwell time of gaze position have various limitations. Therefore, we propose a method for discriminating between intentional and unintentional gaze fixation using a multimodal fuzzy logic algorithm applied to a gaze tracking system with a near-infrared camera sensor.

The agent features a hierarchical search scheme where different levels of abstractions are used. At any level, it uses simulation to rate subspaces that should be further explored in more detail on the next levels.

This paper looks at these challenges with a view towards revolutionizing current learning environments to smart learning environments and provides new suggestions for technological solutions. Furthermore, this paper argues for a transformation from the current learning environments to smart learning environments. This is to be achieved by reengineering the fundamental structure and operations of current educational systems to better integrate these new technologies with the required pedagogical shift.

Predominantly experimental studies have also reported effects of altered corticosteroid levels on subsequent cardiovascular responses. In the current study, we have examined the effects of both birth weight and maternal cortisol levels in a cohort of mothers and their pre-adolescent children. Procedure: A total of 216 women and their 7- to 9-year-old children comprised the cohort. The women had been assessed for plasma cortisol during the first (n = 71), second (n = 72) and third (n = 73) trimester. Maternal cortisol had been measured on a fasting sample taken between 9 and 11 a.m. The children's blood pressure and heart rate were recorded in the resting state, in response to a 10-min video game stress challenge and during recovery. Resting values, incremental responses to stress and recovery were evaluated. Observation: Maternal cortisol levels increased with duration of pregnancy. There were inverse correlations between birth weight and all haemodynamic measures. The positive associations between maternal cortisol and children's haemodynamic measures were most evident in the first and second trimesters. Birth weight was inversely related to maternal cortisol. In multiple regression analyses, the effects of maternal cortisol were more consistent than those of birth weight. Conclusion: Both birth weight and maternal cortisol are predictive of children's resting and stress-modulated haemodynamic measures.

The Nintendo Wii may be an appropriate at-home training device for the COPD population, which could be used as a supplement for a pulmonary rehabilitation program. This study was a randomized, within-subject, cross-over study involving 10 adults with COPD previously enrolled in St Paul's Hospital's pulmonary rehabilitation program. This study attempted to determine if specific Wii activities resulted in similar energy expenditures to that of a more traditional pulmonary rehabilitation activity. Methods: Participants completed two 15-min exercise interventions in a single session, with a washout period of 30min in-between. The interventions were an experimental Wii intervention and a traditional treadmill intervention. Results: There was no significant difference in total energy expenditure between the two 15-min exercise interventions [mean difference 36.3 joules; 95% confidence interval (CI): 31.4, 104]. There was no significant difference in heart rate (mean difference -0.167 beats per minute; 95% CI: -4.83, 4.50), rating of perceived exertion (mean difference 0.100; 95% CI: -0.416, 0.616) and Borg dyspnea scale (mean difference 0.267; 95% CI: -0.004, 0.537) between the two 15-min exercise interventions.

In the second experiment (neuroimaging experiment), the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technique is applied to observe similarities and differences in brain activities between the two elicitation methods. The results show that no significant difference is observed in the ordering behaviors between the two methods. Meanwhile, the neuroimaging data reveal that the strategy method induces comparable activations in similar brain regions, as does the direct-response method. Additionally, it is more likely that subjects adjust their decisions during the feedback phase, rather than during the decision phase.

Guilt occurs when individuals cause harm to others or break social norms. Envy occurs when individuals compare themselves unfavorably to others and desire to benefit from the others' advantage. In both cases, these emotions motivate people to act and change the status quo: following guilt, people try to make amends for the perceived transgression, and following envy, people try to harm envied others. In this article, we present two experiments that study participants' experience of guilt and envy when engaginginsocial decision making with machines and humans. The results showed that, though experiencing the same level of envy, people felt considerably less guilt with machines than with humans. These effects occurred both with subjective and behavioral measures of guilt and envy, and in three different economic games: public goods, ultimatum, and dictator game. This poses an important challenge for human-computer interaction because, as shown here, it leads people to systematically exploit machines, when compared to humans.

Itmakes it possible to scale up/down the allocated computing resources on demand in response to fluctuations of the workload. On clouds, this represents a necessary feature to keep the operating cost at affordable levels while accommodating user-defined QoS requirements. In this article, we study this problem from a game-theoretic perspective. The control logic driving elasticity is distributed among local control agents capable of choosing the right amount of resources to use by each module. In a first step, we model the problem as a noncooperative game in which agents pursue their self-interest. We identify the Nash equilibria and we design a distributed procedure to reach the best equilibrium in the Pareto sense. As a second step, we extend the noncooperative formulation with a decentralized incentive-based mechanism in order to promote cooperation by moving the agreement point closer to the system optimum.

To test this hypothesis, we conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study in which 38 participants played a virtual ball-toss game in which the number of ball tosses to the participant was either similar to (normal-frequency condition) or higher than (high-frequency condition) the number of tosses to the other players. Participants reported greater-than-anticipated enjoyment during the high-frequency condition, suggesting that receiving a social reward led to unexpected positive feelings. Consistent with this, the high-frequency condition produced stronger activation in the ventral striatum, which is part of the reward system, and the precuneus, representing positive self-image, which might be translated to social reward. Furthermore, ventral striatal activation covaried with individual participants' preference for interactions with others.

Here we investigated the behaviour of organised and efficient small human groups in a ballgame defence, and identified three principles of hierarchical resilient help when under attack. First, at a present high emergency level, the helper simply switched the local roles in the attacked subsystem with the helped. Second, at an intermediate emergency level, the helpers effectively acted in overlapping subsystems.

Method: The biofeedback system consisted of Microsoft KinectTM and Nintendo Wii balance board with a dedicated software. A six-week inpatient rehabilitation program was augmented by biofeedback and tested in a single patient following TKR. Three patients underwent a six weeks standard rehabilitation with no biofeedback and served as a control group. Gait, function and pain were assessed and compared before and after the rehabilitation. Results: The biofeedback software incorporated real time visual feedback to correct limb alignment, movement pattern and weight distribution. Improvements in pain, function and quality of life were observed in both groups.

Results: Mean VO2 was significantly (P &lt; 0.001) greater during ""Basic Run"" (16.14 ± 5.8 mL/kg/minute, 4.6 ± 1.7 metabolic equivalents [METs]) than either ""Basic Step"" (11.4 ± 1.7 mL/kg/minute, 3.3 ± 0.5 METs) or the traditional/sedentary videogame (5.39 ± 1.0 mL/kg/minute, 1.5 ± 0.1 METs). ""Basic Step"" was also greater (P &lt; 0.001) than the traditional/sedentary game. VO2 did not significantly (P = 0.25) fluctuate across the 30-minute session for any game. In other words, participants maintained a consistent physiologic intensity throughout each 30-minute condition. There were no differences (P ≥ 0.20) across gaming conditions or time for liking. Conclusions: Participants achieved and maintained moderate-intensity physical activity (≥3.0 METs) during both 30-minute physically interactive videogame conditions. Furthermore, because liking was similar across all gaming conditions, participants may be willing to substitute the physically interactive videogames in place of the traditional/sedentary game. © Copyright 2016, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016.",26978073,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84992688782

We conducted a between-participants experiment in which participants (N = 61) played a frustration induction game, and then an ER game (a breathing strategy game), using one of three types of devices (computer, smartphone, and RGB-D camera). Frustration mood and perceived arousal were the main variables measured. Results revealed a significant interaction between moment (pre-induction phase, post-induction phase, and regulation phase) and the type of interface device used in the frustration mood scores. In participants who used the computer and smartphone, frustration increased after the induction phase and decreased after the regulation phase. However, for participants who used the RGB-D camera, frustration decreased significantly after the induction phase, and this change was maintained after the regulation phase. Changes in arousal were similar with the three devices. This study highlights that the type of interface device (and specifically, the participation of the body) is a crucial variable in the efficacy of serious games affecting users' emotional experience. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Students taking online physical education (OLPE) at home may lack opportunities for competitive or cooperative physical activity that are available to students in a traditional setting. Active video games (exergames) can be played over the internet between students. Exergames allow for a new and possibly effective genre of physical activity that offers OLPE students the opportunity to interact in relevant, engaging, and entertaining physical activity with other students. Secondary student (N=124) heart rates were recorded before exergaming, after playing a non-player character, and after playing another student remotely over the internet. The results show that exergaming between students over the internet can raise student heart rates to moderate levels of physical intensity commensurate with guidelines for Physical Intensity for secondary students. Exergames show promise for physical activity in an OLPE course when played against a non-player character and a remote partner.

This study is the first to examine the effect of a 1-h AVG play on lean and obese adolescents' energy expenditure. Methods Body composition and aerobic fitness were assessed in 19 obese and 12 lean adolescent boys (12-15 years old).

This study characterized a range of behaviors in the hour before bed (i.e., pre-BT behaviors [PBBs]) and examined their relationship with sleep parameters during school and vacation periods (i.e., restricted and extended sleep opportunities, respectively). Mechanistic roles of chronotype and cognitive presleep arousal (PSAcog) were also examined. Methods During the last week of a school term and throughout a 2-week vacation, 146 adolescents (47.26% male, age M ± standard deviation = 16.2 ± 1.0 years) from the general community completed daily sleep measure using actigraphy, self-report measures on PBBs and PSAcog (Presleep Arousal Scale) for both school and vacation periods, and chronotype (Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire). Results Adolescents engaged in a variety of behaviors before bed. Notably, playing video games was associated with significantly later school and vacation BT and shorter school sleep duration (controlling for chronotype). During vacation, online social media was associated with significantly longer sleep onset latency, and this relationship was mediated by higher PSAcog. In contrast, on school nights, spending time with family was associated with significantly earlier BT and longer sleep duration. Conclusions Technology-related PBBs video games and online social media were risk factors for shorter and poorer sleep, whereas time with family was protective of sleep duration. In addressing sleep problems in adolescents, therapeutic procedures that target the potentially addictive nature of technology use and reduce PSAcog were implicated. © 2016 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

As a result, many media literacy programs were implemented to tackle that major public health issue. However, there is little evidence about their effectiveness. Evaluating design effectiveness, particularly regarding targeting process, would prevent adverse effects and improve the evaluation of evidence-based media literacy programs. Objectives: The present research examined whether or not different relational lifestyles may explain the different effects of an antiviolence intervention program. Research design: Based on relational and lifestyles theory, the authors designed a randomized controlled trial and applied an analysis of variance 2 (treatment: experimental vs. control) × 4 (lifestyle classes emerged from data using latent class analysis: communicative vs. autonomous vs. meta-reflexive vs. fractured). Subjects: Seven hundred and thirty-five Italian students distributed in 47 classes participated anonymously in the research (51.3% females). Measures: Participants completed a lifestyle questionnaire as well as their attitudes and behavioral intentions as the dependent measures. Results: The results indicated that the program was effective in changing adolescents’ attitudes toward violence. However, behavioral intentions toward consumption of violent video games were moderated by lifestyles. Those with communicative relational lifestyles showed fewer intentions to consume violent video games, while a boomerang effect was found among participants with problematic lifestyles. Conclusion: Adolescents’ lifestyles played an important role in influencing the effectiveness of an intervention aimed at changing behavioral intentions toward the consumption of violent video games. For that reason, audience lifestyle segmentation analysis should be considered an essential technique for designing, evaluating, and improving media literacy programs. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84988654486

Therefore, the objective of this research is to understand how player performance in an exergame affects psychological responses (autonomy, competence, and presence), enjoyment of the experience, and likelihood for future play. Subjects and Methods: Sixty-two college students (mean age, 20.32 years) participated in an experiment where they played a challenge event on the ""Biggest Loser"" exergame for the Nintendo (Kyoto, Japan) Wii™ console. Participants were given up to two chances to see if they could ""win"" the challenge event. A lab assistant recorded player performance for each session in minutes and seconds (range, 30 seconds-10 minutes). The attempt in which the participant achieved the greatest amount of time playing was used as a measure of player performance. After playing, subjects filled out a questionnaire with items pertaining to enjoyment, competence, autonomy, presence, and future intentions for continued use of the exergame. Results: The results suggest that player achievement (longer time spent playing) directly and indirectly predicts feelings of autonomy, competence, presence, enjoyment, and future intentions to play. Individuals who performed better felt more autonomous and experienced greater presence, leading to greater enjoyment. Enjoyment and presence were found to mediate the relationship between player performance and future intentions to play an exergame. Conclusions: This study suggests that performance in exergames is related to psychological experiences that fuel enjoyment and the likelihood for future exergame use. The theoretical and practical significances of these findings are discussed, as well as future research involving exergames. © Copyright 2016, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016.",26871873,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84992694383

Objective: The purpose of this study is to demonstrate this laterality and discuss its relevance to cognitive and neurophysiological asymmetries associated with drug abuse vulnerability in order to provide new insights for future research in drug abuse. Method: From published reports, brain areas of activation for two tests of response inhibition or craving for drugs of abuse were compiled from fMRI activation peaks and were tabulated for eight sections (octants) in each hemisphere. Percent asymmetries were calculated (R-L/R+L) across studies for each area. Results: For impulsivity, most activation peaks favored the right hemisphere. Overall, the percent difference was 32% (Χ2 = 16.026; p &lt; 0.0001) with the greater asymmetry for anterior peaks (46.8%; Χ2 = 17.329; p &lt; 0.0001). The asymmetries for cue-induced craving were opposite, favoring the left hemisphere by 6.7% (Χ2 = 4.028; p &lt; 0.05). The consistency of left asymmetry was found for almost all drugs. For nicotine, studies where subjects were not allowed to smoke (deprived) prior to measurement had the same left hemisphere activation but those who smoked (satiated) before the fMRI measure showed right asymmetry. Conclusion: Brain activation studies demonstrate different left/right hemispheric contributions for impulsivity versus craving - factors related to addiction.

About half of the stroke survivors are left with some degree of disability. Innovative methodologies for restorative neurorehabilitation are urgently required to reduce long-term disability. The ability of the nervous system to reorganize its structure, function and connections as a response to intrinsic or extrinsic stimuli is called neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity is involved in post-stroke functional disturbances, but also in rehabilitation. Beneficial neuroplastic changes may be facilitated with non-invasive electrotherapy, such as neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) and sensory electrical stimulation (SES). NMES involves coordinated electrical stimulation of motor nerves and muscles to activate them with continuous short pulses of electrical current while SES involves stimulation of sensory nerves with electrical current resulting in sensations that vary from barely perceivable to highly unpleasant. Here, active cortical participation in rehabilitation procedures may be facilitated by driving the non-invasive electrotherapy with biosignals (electromyogram (EMG), electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculogram (EOG)) that represent simultaneous active perception and volitional effort. To achieve this in a resource-poor setting, e.g., in low- and middle-income countries, we present a low-cost human-machine-interface (HMI) by leveraging recent advances in off-the-shelf video game sensor technology. In this paper, we discuss the open-source software interface that integrates low-cost off-the-shelf sensors for visual- auditory biofeedback with non-invasive electrotherapy to assist postural control during balance rehabilitation.

Although empathic concern is pervasive in daily life, its neural mechanisms remain unclear. Empathic concern involves the suppression of the emotional response to others’ distress, which occurs when individuals distance themselves emotionally from the distressed individual. We hypothesized that helping behavior induced by empathic concern, accompanied by perspective-taking, would attenuate the neural activation representing aversive feelings. We also predicted reward system activation due to the positive feeling resulting from helping behavior. Participant underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while playing a virtual ball-toss game. In some blocks (“concern condition”), one player (“isolated player”) did not receive ball-tosses from other players. In this condition, participants increased ball-tosses to the isolated player (helping behavior). Participants then evaluated the improved enjoyment of the isolated player resulting from their helping behavior. Anterior cingulate activation during the concern condition was attenuated by the evaluation of the effect of helping behavior. The right temporoparietal junction, which is involved in perspective-taking and the dorsal striatum, part of the reward system, were also activated during the concern condition. These results suggest that humans can attenuate affective arousal by anticipating the positive outcome of empathic concern through perspective-taking. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",26032190,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84958888807

We hypothesized that, compared with control participants, mania-prone people would show ER deficits when they received implicit, but not explicit, cues to use ER. Methods Undergraduates (N = 66) completed the Hypomanic Personality Scale (HPS) and were randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions: automatic ER (scrambled sentence primes), deliberate ER (verbal instructions), or control (no priming or instructions to use ER). Then, participants played a videogame designed to evoke anger. Emotion responses were measured with a multi-modal assessment of self-reported affect, psychophysiology, and facial expressions. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) was used to index ER. Results The videogame effectively elicited subjective anger, angry facial expressions, and heart rate increases when keys malfunctioned. As hypothesized, persons who were more mania prone showed greater RSA increases in the deliberate ER condition than in the automatic or control conditions.

The present study investigated and compared the effects of interactivity, or agency, on the physiological responses of participants as measures of direct fear as they either played or watched a horror-themed video game. Assuming agency allows for greater immersion, the former group would exhibit greater physiological responses, possibly indicating greater fear reaction. Change scores were calculated from subtracting baseline mean values from exposure mean values for every participant in measures of electrodermal activity (EDA), respiratory rate (RR), and heart rate (HR). Self-reported fear data was also gathered for every participant. Players had a significantly greater increase than watchers in EDA, RR, and HR change scores. Players and watchers did not differ significantly in self-reported fear. Change score t tests for specific events that occur in the video game are also reported.

The diagnostic criteria are based on those for Substance Use Disorder and Gambling Disorder. Excessive gamblers and persons with Substance Use Disorder show attentional biases towards stimuli related to their addictions. We investigated whether excessive Internet gamers show a similar attentional bias, by using two established experimental paradigms. Methods: We measured reaction times of excessive Internet gamers and non-gamers (N = 51, 23.7 ± 2.7 years) by using an addiction Stroop with computerrelated and neutral words, as well as a visual probe with computer-related and neutral pictures. Mixed design analyses of variance with the between-subjects factor group (gamer/non-gamer) and the within-subjects factor stimulus type (computer-related/neutral) were calculated for the reaction times as well as for valence and familiarity ratings of the stimulus material. Results: In the addiction Stroop, an interaction for group × word type was found: Only gamers showed longer reaction times to computer-related words compared to neutral words, thus exhibiting an attentional bias. In the visual probe, no differences in reaction time between computer-related and neutral pictures were found in either group, but the gamers were faster overall. Conclusions: An attentional bias towards computer-related stimuli was found in excessive Internet gamers, by using an addiction Stroop but not by using a visual probe. A possible explanation for the discrepancy could lie in the fact that the visual probe may have been too easy for the gamers. © 2016 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest.",28092198,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84966332528

Our goal was to determine how effective they are in achieving motor learning goals and fitness benefits as players gain experience. Design: We employed a repeated measures design to determine changes in physical exertion and engagement with training. Methods: Fourteen healthy adults trained on the XBOX Kinect video game Dance Central using a skill-based protocol to examine changes in energy expenditure (EE), heart rate (HR), METs, limb movement, game proficiency, and player engagement in initial, post-training, and transfer-testing of a full-body dance exer-game. Data were analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance, p < 0.05. Results: Both EE, HR, and METs increased from initial (EE 4.89 ± 1.35, HR 103 ± 18, METs 4.25 ± 0.72) to post-training (EE 5.92 ± 1.25, HR 110 ± 15, METs 5.05 ± 0.75) and were greatest during transfer-testing (EE 6.34 ± 1.35, HR 115 ± 17, METs 5.42 ± 0.88, p ≤ 0.001). Proficiency, measured by game scores, also increased from initial to post-training and transfer-testing (≤ 0.002). Limb movement and player engagement remained unchanged. Conclusions: It is important to understand whether player physiological and psychophysiological responses change with continued game-play. Although Dance Central involves whole-body movement, physical exertion remained at moderate levels after training. As exer-game and virtual reality systems move from their initial novelty, research about how players react to continued involvement with a game can guide game developers to maintain a freshness through game progression that preserves the participant's attentional focus, minimizes attrition and maintains a prescribed level of energy exertion. © 2015 Sports Medicine Australia.",25824058,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84958039213

To explore the effects of adaptation mechanisms on player experience, we conducted a mixed-methods study on three different versions of the game, two of which integrated varying biofeedback mechanisms. Players’ affective experiences were objectively measured by analysing physiological data. Additionally, subjective experience was recorded through the use of the Game Experience Questionnaire. Our study confirmed that biofeedback functionality had a statistically significant effect on the ratings of player experience dimensions: immersion, tension, positive affect, and negative affect. Furthermore, participants reported noticeable differences in player experience, favouring the added depth present in the biofeedback-enabled iterations of the game.

We present an approach of utilizing recognized emotions to improve the interaction itself, independent of the underlying application at hand. Examining the state of the art in emotion recognition research and based on the architecture of Companion-System, a generic approach for determining the main cause of an emotion within the history of interactions is presented, allowing a specific reaction and adaption.

However, and despite users getting actively involved in immersive three-dimensional virtual environments that incorporate sound and motion, there are individual factors, such as age, video game knowledge, and the predisposition to immersion, that may be associated with the quality of virtual reality experience. Moreover, one particular concern for users engaged in immersive virtual reality environments (VREs) is the possibility of side effects, such as cybersickness. The literature suggests that at least 60% of virtual reality users report having felt symptoms of cybersickness, which reduces the quality of the virtual reality experience. The aim of this study was thus to profile the right user to be involved in a VRE through head-mounted display. To examine which user characteristics are associated with the most effective virtual reality experience (lower cybersickness), a multiple correspondence analysis combined with cluster analysis technique was performed. Results revealed three distinct profiles, showing that the PC gamer profile is more associated with higher levels of virtual reality effectiveness, that is, higher predisposition to be immersed and reduced cybersickness symptoms in the VRE than console gamer and nongamer. These findings can be a useful orientation in clinical practice and future research as they help identify which users are more predisposed to benefit from immersive VREs. © Copyright 2016, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",26985781,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84962575510

But over the last five years, the key local ""creative"" industries such as video game development and film production have suffered, with a number of large firms leaving Vancouver, and industry employment declining sharply. Drawing on more than 40 interviews conducted over a five-year period with members of the local video game community, our paper documents the rise and more recent decline of Vancouvers ""new economy"" sector.

Materials and Methods: Nineteen young males participated in the study (age, 23 ± 3 years; height, 178 ± 6 cm; weight, 78 ± 15 kg). Participants completed a maximum oxygen uptake (VO2 max) test and a gaming session, including AVGs (""Reflex Ridge,"" ""River Rush,"" and ""Boxing"" for the Microsoft [Redmond, WA] Kinect™) and SVGs (""FIFA 14"" [Electronic Arts, Burnaby, BC, Canada] and ""Call of Duty"" [Activision, Santa Monica, CA]). Heart rate (HR) and oxygen uptake VO2) were recorded continuously during all videogames. Rating of perceived exertion (RPE) was taken every 3 minutes during AVGs and SVGs. Energy expenditure (EE), expressed as metabolic equivalents (METs), was calculated. One MET was defined as the volume of oxygen consumed at rest in a seated position and is equal to 3.5 mL of O2/kg of body mass/minute. The exercise intensity for each game was expressed as a percentage of VO2 max and percentage of age-predicted maximum HR (HRmax). Results: Exercise intensity (percentage HRmax, percentage VO2 max, and RPE) and EE (METs) were significantly higher during active gaming compared with sedentary gameplay (P &lt; 0.01). AVGs elicited moderate levels of exercise intensity (64-72 percent HRmax) in line with current recommended physical activity guidelines.

To examine this, we analysed a large anonymized dataset from a popular MOBA ('League of Legends') - by some measures the most popular game in the world. We find that user names contain two pieces of information that correlate with in-game social behaviour. Both player age (estimated from numerical sequences within name) and the presence of highly anti-social words are correlated with the valences of player/player interactions within the game.

The essential experience principle suggests connecting all aspects of the experience around a central emotion or cognitive connection. The discovery principle promotes indirect learning in focused environments. The risktaking principle addresses the uncertainties clients face when attempting newly learned skills in novel situations. The generalization principle encourages multiple opportunities for skill transfer. The reward system principle directly relates to the scaffolding of frequent and varied feedback in treatment.

This paper examines the relationships between these variables for a simulated Mars-mission. Six volunteers (well-educated and -motivated men) were isolated for 520 days in a simulated spacecraft in which they had to execute a (virtual) mission to Mars. As part of this mission, every other week, several computer tasks were performed. These tasks consisted of a negotiation game, a chat-based learning activity and an entertainment game. Before and after these tasks, and after post-task questionnaires, the participants rated their emotional state consisting of arousal, valence and dominance, and their cognitive task load consisting of level of information processing, time occupied and task-set switches. Results revealed significant differences between cognitive task load and emotional state levels when work content varied. Significant regression models were also found that could explain variation in task performance.

The designed robotic systems have successfully incorporated the kinematics required and have had appropriate machine vision elements for a decent gameplay. Independently, computer scientists have also developed the artificial intelligence programs needed for the strategy to play billiards. Despite these developments, the accurate ball manipulation aspect of the game, needed for good performance, has not been addressed enough; two important parameters are the potting accuracy and advantageous cue ball positioning for next shot. In this regard, robotic ball manipulation by predicting the ball trajectories under the action of various dynamic phenomena, such as ball spin, impacts and friction, is the key consideration of this research. By establishing a connection to the methods used in nonprehensile robotic manipulation, a forward model is developed for the rolling, sliding, and two distinct types of frictional impacts of billiards balls are developed. High-speed camera-based tracking is performed to determine the physical parameters required for the developed dynamic models. To solve the inverse manipulation problem, i.e., the decision on shot parameters, for accurate ball positioning, an optimization based solution is proposed. A simplistic ball manipulator is designed and used to test the theoretical developments. Experimental results show that a 90% potting accuracy and a 100-200 mm post-shot cue ball positioning accuracy has been achieved by the autonomous system within a table area of 6 × 5 ft2. © 1996-2012 IEEE.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84961922785

In the current study participants played a modified first-person shooter in one of four different conditions, with either high or low difficulty and high or low violent game content. We assessed number of kills and number of deaths as game performance. Neither the difficulty nor the displayed violence had an effect on psychophysiological arousal during play, post-game aggressive cognitions, nor aggressive behavior. Thus, this study corroborates previous research indicating that violence in games does not substantially influence human behavior or experience, and other game characteristics deserve more attention in game effects studies. In addition, findings showed that challenge manipulated by game difficulty is of main importance for post-game emotions: Number of deaths predicted positive affect, but only in the low difficulty condition while number of kills was a positive predictor for positive affect and a negative predictor for negative affect. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In the RoboCup MSL, two teams of five autonomous robots play on an 18-X 12-m field. Equipped with sensors and on-board computers, each robot should be able to perceive the environment, make decision and control itself to play the soccer game autonomously. Design/methodology/approach: This paper presents the design of our soccer robots, participating in RoboCup MSL. The mechanical platform, electrical architecture and software framework are discussed separately. The mechanical platform is designed modularly, so easy maintainability is achieved; the electronic architecture is built on industrial standards using PC-based control technique, which results in high robustness and reliability during the intensive and fierce MSL games; the software is developed upon the open-source Robot Operating System (ROS); thus, the advantages of ROS such as modularity, portability and expansibility are inherited. Findings: Based on this paper and the open-source hardware and software, the MSL robots can be re-developed easily to participate in the RoboCup MSL. The robots can also be used in other research and education fields, especially for multi-robot systems and distributed artificial intelligence. Furthermore, the main designing ideas proposed in the paper, i.e. using a modular mechanical structure, an industrial electronic system and ROS-based software, provide a common solution for designing general intelligent robots.

SFUs are an auditory interaction means for machines that allow emotion and intent expression, which are composed of vocalizations and sounds without semantic content or language dependence. Currently, SFUs are most commonly utilized in animation movies (e.g., R2-D2, WALL-E, Despicable Me), cartoons (e.g., “Teletubbies,” “Morph,” “La Linea”), and computer games (e.g., The Sims) and hold significant potential for applications in HRI. SFUs are categorized under four general types: Gibberish Speech (GS), Non-Linguistic Utterances (NLUs), Musical Utterances (MU), and Paralinguistic Utterances (PU). By introducing the concept of SFUs and bringing multiple sets of studies in social HRI that have never been analyzed jointly before, this article addresses the need for a comprehensive study of the existing literature for SFUs. It outlines the current grand challenges, open questions, and provides guidelines for future researchers considering to utilize SFU in social HRI.

Since the income of the video game industry exceeds that of the film industry, the field of inducting emotions through video games and virtual environments is attracting more attention. Our theory, widely supported by substantial literature, is that the chromatic stimuli intensity, brightness, and saturation of a video game environment produce an emotional effect on players. We have observed a correlation between the RGB additives color spaces, HSV, HSL, and HSI components of video game images, presented to n=85 participants, and the emotional statements expressed in terms of arousal and valence, recovered in a subjective semantic questionnaire. Our results show a significant correlation between luminance, saturation, lightness, and the emotions of joy, sadness, fear, and serenity experienced by participants viewing 24 video game images. We also show strong correlations between the colorimetric diversity, saliency volume, and stimuli conspicuity and the emotions expressed by the players. These results allow us to propose video game environment development methods in the form of a circumplex model.

Undergraduate students were categorized as violent video game players (n=83) or non-gamers (n=69) and completed a facial recognition task, consisting of an emotion recognition condition and a control condition of gender recognition. Additionally, participants completed questionnaires assessing their video game and media consumption, aggression, and mood. Violent video game players recognized fearful faces both more accurately and quickly and disgusted faces less accurately than non-gamers. Desensitization to violence, constant exposure to fear and anxiety during game playing, and the habituation to unpleasant stimuli, are possible mechanisms that could explain these results.

Resonant frequency breathing is a potential non-invasive means of intervention for improving the balance of the autonomic nervous system and increasing HRV. However, such breathing exercises are regarded as boring and monotonous tasks. The use of gaming elements (gamification) or a full gaming experience is a well-recognised method for achieving higher motivation and engagement in various tasks. However, there is limited documented knowledge on how to design a game for breathing exercises. In particular, the influence of additional interactive elements on the main course of training has not yet been explored. In this paper, we evaluated the satisfaction levels achieved using different game elements and how disruptive they were to the main task, i.e., paced breathing training. An Android flight game was developed with three game modes that differ in the degrees of multitasking they require. Design, development, and evaluation were conducted using a user-centred approach, including context analysis, the design of game principle mock-ups, the selection of game principles through a survey, the design of the game mechanics and GUI mock-up, and icon testing, and the performance of a summative study through user questionnaires and interviews. A summative evaluation of the developed game was performed with 11 healthy participants (ages 40-67) in a controlled setting. The results confirm the potential of video games for motivating players to engage in HRV biofeedback training. The highest training performance on the first try was achieved through pure visualisation rather than in a multitasking mode. Players had higher motivation to play the more challenging game and were more interested in long-term engagement. A framework for gamified HRV biofeedback research is presented. It has been shown that multitasking has considerable influence on HRV biofeedback and should be used with an adaptive challenge level. © 2013 IEEE.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027047802

We conducted two experiments that investigated the effects of sexual arousal among male and female participants. Experiment 1 (N = 144) examined the impact of sexual around on sexual health decision-making. Sexually explicit and neutral video clips as well as hypothetical romantic scenarios were used to evaluate the effects of sexual arousal on sexual risk-taking intentions. Men and women who reported higher levels of sexual arousal also displayed greater intentions to participate in risky sexual behavior (e.g., unprotected sex with a new sex partner). Experiment 2 (N = 122) examined the impact of sexual arousal on general risk-taking, using the same videos clips as in Experiment 1 and a modified version of a computerized Blackjack card game. Participants were offered a chance to make either a risky play or a safe play during ambiguous conditions. Increased sexual arousal in Experiment 2 was associated with impulsivity and a greater willingness to make risky plays in the Blackjack game. These findings suggest that, in situations where there are strong sexually visceral cues, both men and women experiencing strong sexual arousal may have lower inhibitions and may experience impaired decision-making. This phenomenon may have an impact during sexual encounters and may contribute to a failure to use appropriate prophylactic protection. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",26310879,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84953370178

Evidence addressing how stress-induced BP reactivity in young adults is associated with midlife cognitive function is sparse. Methods and Results-We assessed BP reactivity during a star tracing task and a video game in adults aged 20 to 32 years. Twenty-three years later, cognitive function was assessed with use of the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (a psychomotor speed test), the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (a verbal memory test), and the modified Stroop test (an executive function test). At the time of follow-up, participants (n=3021) had a mean age of 50.2 years; 56% were women, and 44% were black. In linear regression models adjusted for demographic and clinical characteristics including baseline and follow-up resting BP, lower systolic BP (SBP) reactivity during the star tracing and video game was associated with worse Digit Symbol Substitution Test scores (b [SE]: 0.11 [0.02] and 0.05 [0.02], respectively) and worse performance on the Stroop test (b [SE]: -0.06 [0.02] and -0.05 [0.02]; all P>0.01). SBP reactivity was more consistently associated than diastolic BP reactivity with cognitive function scores. The associations between SBP reactivity and cognitive function were mostly similar between blacks and whites.

It also summarizes research designed around specialized learning games designed to test the effectiveness of badges on learner variables such as performance and motivation. To connect game achievements to digital badges in other educational scenarios, both psychological and design factors are considered. First, connections between games research and learner motivation are discussed, especially in regards to autonomy, mastery, and purpose. Implications for measurement and assessment are considered and strategies for evaluation from prior games researchers are reviewed. Next, an overview of achievement systems within popular game environments is provided. The second half of the chapter considers best practices for designing badges as proposed by game achievement researchers. One game, Fallout Shelter, is discussed in detail in regards to its use of effective achievement design. Educational badge designers who may be working in game-based systems or other interactive learning spaces can use this information to build better badging systems in other realms of learning. The chapter also shares some caveats gleaned from the use of achievements in video games. These cautionary notes about achievements taken too far, or achievements that overpower other features of learning spaces, are useful to consider for using digital badges effectively in educational environments. The chapter concludes by proposing directions for future research exploring the connections between video game achievements and digital badges. © 2016 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",,"English",Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017628948

Possible overlooked drivers of obesity and its consequent cardio-metabolic deficits include videogame addiction and the resulting curtailed sleep; both are growing problems among adolescents. The objective of this study is to examine possible associations among these concepts in adolescents, as a means to point to plausible interventions.METHODS: Data were collected from 94 adolescents who play videogames and are enrolled in outpatient clinics, using surveys, wearable sleep monitors (FitBit), physical exams, and blood tests at three points in time. These data were subjected to structural equation modeling (SEM) analyses and bootstrapping-based mediation testing procedures.RESULTS: Videogame addiction among adolescents was negatively associated with sleep duration (β = -0.24). Sleep duration was negatively associated with obesity (β = -0.30), which in turn was associated with elevated blood pressure (β = 0.26), low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (β = -0.18), high triglycerides (β = 0.61), and high insulin resistance (β = 0.39). The model explained 36.2% of the variation in sleep duration, 32.7% of the variation in obesity, and between 12.8% and 28.1% of the variation in cardio-metabolic indicators. Post-hoc analyses indicated that curtailed sleep is a possible full mediator of the association between videogame addiction, abdominal obesity and the associated cardio-metabolic deficits.CONCLUSION: The findings point to possible information systems use lifestyle-health links, which behooves researchers and practitioners to pay closer attention to possible adverse health outcomes of technology-related addictions. Interventions that target problematic video-gaming and sleep should be devised as a possible means for improving adolescents' long-term cardio-metabolic health.",27149512,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84979632850

In order to complement existing presentations and create a memorable enjoyable learning experience, computer games are used in current educational practices. They offer educators opportunities to reorganize and conceptualize abstract, complex and technological information or knowledge for young learners. To demonstrate and evaluate how a serious game can facilitate the learning activities in a more constructive and meaningful way, we select a computer game which is about the waste recycling to conduct a user study and investigate the pedagogical effects of this game. While designing this user study, we particularly focus on the link between game play and physiological state of a player as the measurement of his performance. Both quantitative and qualitative data are collected during the study. The results have shown that this game indeed can help learners understand the important knowledge of waste recycling being studied. The study also indicates that physiological signals can be an indicator of his mental state of a player to some extent.

For the purpose, the unified representation based on ontology is employed for game elements, game challenge model and knowledge expression with which the relationship mapping mechanism from diverse categories of knowledge onto game atomic element, especially primary rule, is constructed. As a result, a practical design technique that facilitates to import knowledge into applied game is achieved. In order to verify the practicability, a case of applied game, Qbaby Picture Matching game is designed and developed based on the proposed method. It has been running online and applied in a kindergarten. Moreover, an experiment is performed to identify the effects of education and entertainment.

Design: This was a hospital-based cross-sectional study. Methods: A study of 122 children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes was conducted over an 8-month period. Self-reported physical activity time and time spent watching TVor playing computer or video games were obtained using interviewer-Administered questionnaires. Retinal vascular caliber was measured by a trained grader using a standardized protocol and later summarized as central retinal artery equivalent (CRAE) and central retinal vein equivalent (CRVE) using a semiautomated computer program. Results: After adjusting for confounders (age, sex, ethnicity, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, HbA1c, maternal smoking status, age at which cow'smilk was introduced, and CRVE/CRAE, respectively), narrower CRAE was independently related to more time spent playing computer/ video games [ExpB = -3.85; 95% confidence interval (CI), -6.41 to -1.29; P = 0.004], whereas wider CRVE was independently related to lower physical activity level (ExpB = -1.08; 95% CI, -2.01 to -0.15; P = 0.03) and more time spent playing computer/video games (ExpB = 4.72; 95% CI, 0.52-8.92; P = 0.02). Television viewing time was not associated with retinal vascular caliber after adjustment. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that physical activity and sedentary behaviors in the form of ""screen viewing time"" are associated with retinal vessel caliber early in life. These results suggest that retinal vascular caliber may provide prognostic information beyond current traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Future longitudinal and interventional studies are warranted to evaluate the relevance of these observations.

However, it is still unclear how feedback (outcomes of decision-making) affects the subsequent risky decision-making in individuals with IGD. In this study, twenty-four adolescents with IGD and 24 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited and underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing the balloon analog risk task (BART) to evaluate the effects of prior outcomes on brain activity during subsequent risky decision-making in adolescents with IGD. The covariance between risk level and activation of the bilateral ventral medial prefrontal cortex, left inferior frontal cortex, right ventral striatum (VS), left hippocampus/parahippocampus, right inferior occipital gyrus/fusiform gyrus and right inferior temporal gyrus demonstrated interaction effects of group by outcome (P < 0.05, AlphaSim correction).

Using the Socratic method as a theoretical inspiration, we develop an experimental method and computational model for computers to learn subjective information about emotions by playing emotion twenty questions (EMO20Q), a game of twenty questions limited to words denoting emotions. Using human-human EMO20Q data we bootstrap a sequential Bayesian model that drives a generalized pushdown automaton-based dialog agent that further learns from 300 human-computer dialogs collected on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The human-human EMO20Q dialogs show the capability of humans to use a large, rich, subjective vocabulary of emotion words. Training on successive batches of human-computer EMO20Q dialogs shows that the automated agent is able to learn fromsubsequent human-computer interactions. Our results show that the training procedure enables the agent to learn a large set of emotion words. The fully trained agent successfully completes EMO20Q at 67% of human performance and 30% better than the bootstrapped agent. Even when the agent fails to guess the human opponent's emotion word in the EMO20Q game, the agent's behavior of searching for knowledge makes it appear human-like, which enables the agent to maintain user engagement and learn new, out-of-vocabulary words. These results lead us to conclude that the question-asking methodology and its implementation as a sequential Bayes pushdown automaton are a successful model for the cognitive abilities involved in learning, retrieving, and using emotion words by an automated agent in a dialog setting. © 2016 Kazemzadeh et al.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030104783

These sequences are characterized for depicting a mix of computer generated graphics, text, and camera-captured material. Such a mix poses several challenges, as the content usually depicts multiple strong discontinuities, which are hard to encode using current techniques. Differential pulse code modulation (DPCM)-based intra-prediction has shown to improve coding efficiency for these sequences. In this paper we propose sample-based edge and angular prediction (SEAP), a collection of DPCM-based intra-prediction modes to improve lossless coding of screen content. SEAP is aimed at accurately predicting regions depicting not only camera-captured material, but also those depicting strong edges. It incorporates modes that allow selecting the best predictor for each pixel individually based on the characteristics of the causal neighborhood of the target pixel. We incorporate SEAP into HEVC intra-prediction. Evaluation results on various screen content sequences show the advantages of SEAP over other DPCM-based approaches, with bit-rate reductions of up to 19.56% compared to standardized RDPCM. When used in conjunction with the coding tools of the screen content coding extensions, SEAP provides bit-rate reductions of up to 8.63% compared to RDPCM. © 2011 IEEE.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027720585

To fill this gap, the current study examined the effect of anthropomorphic representations of computerized helpers in computer games on game enjoyment. In the current research, consumers enjoyed a computer game less when they received assistance from a computerized helper imbued with humanlike features than from a helper construed as a mindless entity. We offer a novel mechanism that the presence of an anthropomorphized helper can undermine individuals' perceived autonomy during a computer game. Across six experiments, we show that the presence of an anthropomorphized helper reduced game enjoyment across three different games. By measuring participants' perceived autonomy (study 1) and employing moderators such as importance of autonomy (studies 2, 3, and 4), we also provide evidence that the reduced feeling of autonomy serves as the mechanism underlying the backfiring effect.

The reported lifetime complication rate is 4%, mostly due to hemorrhage, obstruction, perforation or inflammation. A symptomatic Meckel's diverticulum due to rupture after blunt abdominal trauma is very rare. We believe this case report is the first reporting a rupture of a Meckel's diverticulum after a low velocity blunt abdominal trauma and outlining the importance of a thorough and complete examination of the patient after blunt abdominal trauma. Presentation of case a 17-year-old male presented with abdominal pain after blunt abdominal trauma during a soccer game. Physical examination showed signs of peritonitis in all quadrants of the abdomen. During admission the patient deteriorated with decreasing blood pressure and raising pulse rate. A CT-scan showed free abdominal fluid. Our patient was scheduled for an emergent laparotomy where a perforated Meckel's diverticulum with fecal spill was found. A segmental ileal resection was performed. Post-operative, patient developed a pneumonia and also intra-abdominal abscesses treated with percutaneous drainage. After an admission period of 17-days the patient was discharged. Conclusion perforation of a Meckel's diverticulum is rarely suspected as a cause of acute deterioration following blunt abdominal trauma.

Objective: This study aimed at evaluating the usability and short-term training effects of X-Torp, an action SeG designed for elderly ND subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. Methods: X-Torp is a SeG played using the Microsoft® Kinect™. 10 ND subjects and 8 healthy elderly controls (HEC) were enrolled in a 1-month program with three training sessions per week. Usability was evaluated through game time, game performance, the aerobic intensity level reached, perceived emotions, and perceived usability. Results: All participants successfully completed the training program. ND subjects played less and had a lower game performance compared to HEC. During the sessions, ND subjects maintained a light intensity of aerobic activity, while HEC maintained a moderate intensity. Both groups experienced only positive emotions, and reported a 'moderate' to 'high' perceived competence, a 'moderate' game difficulty, and a 'high' interest in the game.

It is not intended for certification and training purpose. Driven by the 2010 European Resuscitation Council guidelines we have designed a game composed of eight mini games corresponding to the main steps of the protocol. The player acts as a helper and has to solve a different challenge. We present a detailed description of the game creation process presenting the requirements, the design decisions, and the implementation details. In addition, we present some first impressions of our testing users (25 children, five of each age from 8 to 12 years old and 12 males and 13 females). We evaluated clarity of instructions and three settings of the game: the aesthetics of scenarios, the playability, and the enjoyability of each mini game. All games were well punctuated, and there are no significantly differences between their sex.

In contrast with passive forms of escapism, whereby consumers act as observers (e.g. watching a movie), active escapism provides consumers with the opportunity to directly interact with mediated realities, whether constructed in a virtual space (e.g. a video game) or the real world. Design/methodology/approach: Within the context of video game consumption, a conceptual framework for active escapism comprised antecedents, processes and consequences is established through literature review, depth interviews and naturalistic inquiry. Findings: The findings suggest that active escapism functions as a coping mechanism when consumers are confronted with external stressors that threaten either their sense of identity or control. While other forms of emotion-focused coping relieve stress through psychological avoidance (i.e. refocusing of attention away from stressors), active escapism provides the benefits of affirmation and empowerment through projective fantasy (i.e. role-play) and presence (i.e. immersion into a mediated reality). Originality/value: The conceptual framework established by this analysis gives insight into the structure of active escapism as a theoretical construct, providing a foundation for future research. Managerial implications for consumer escapism (e.g. branded in-game content) are discussed. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84994403986

Previous research demonstrates that euphoric individuals think more broadly and schematically, and that dysphoric individuals are more focused and details-oriented. We investigated the effect of mood on analogical transfer in four conditions: (1) expert euphoric; (2) expert dysphoric; (3) nonexpert euphoric; and (4) nonexpert dysphoric. Mood was induced from watching a 10-minute video (a comedy excerpt to induce euphoria; a realistic depiction of nuclear war for dysphoria). The affect grid was used for a manipulation check. In expert conditions, participants first played the five-disk Tower of Hanoi (TOH) game, followed by the Bear God (BG) task, a new isomorph of TOH (same rules, different surface features). Participants were not told about the hidden isomorphism. In nonexpert conditions, participants played an unrelated game first. Based on prior literature, it would be possible that dysphoria could either hamper or enhance analogical reasoning. We found evidence for the latter – superior performance in the dysphoric BG task – but only in the expert condition. The implication for religion is that expertise and dysphoria have special cognitive functions in ritual. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84945329824

Eighteen male players of a soccer team played against each other both types of SSG, both played as two 4-minute bouts interspersed with 4-minute rest. Physical (distances, velocities and accelerations) and HR demands were recorded by a GPS system (15hz) and a heart rate monitor during SSG. The individual tactical behaviors proposed by the System of Tactical Assessment in Soccer were registered by an observer who analyzed the SSG videos. Reliability was verified calculating the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and the absolute and percentage standard error of measurement (SEM and %SEM, respectively), both considering athletes’ individual scores in each SSG bout. As a result, higher number of variables related to physical and physiological demands presented significant ICC values, being classified as moderate to excellent in relation to variables related to tactical demands. Considering these variables that presented significant ICC values in both SSG, the SEM% values found for physical and physiological variables ranged from 3.0 to 42.0%, while those found for the tactical variables ranged from 31.6 to 75.0%. It could be concluded that several variables related to physical and physiological demands present moderate to excellent reliability.

Computer games became the mostly preferred spare time activity for children of different ages. Several studies found that technology, ranging from computer applications to social robots, can act as a mediator to improve interaction for children with social impairments. The contribution presented is an intermediate step which combines the embodiment with tangible and intuitive interaction that social robots can offer and an affordable and autonomous solution as a computer game. Probogotchi is a way to play an educational computer game, where children have to interact with a toy equipped with sensors connected to a PC. The control architecture is built around an artificial homeostatic system for social agents and is set to simulate pet-like behavior, resulting in a dependency on the user's interactions. As such, affective human-computer interaction is achieved. The homeostatic regulation is an autonomous system that uses input stimuli from a tactile and object identification system to detect certain actions originating from the user. If an action is triggered, it will influence the internal needs that are subsequently translated into an emotional state. This emotional state is communicated back to the user by a virtual model showing the corresponding facial expression. For the evaluation section, a preliminary study using Probogotchi as a bridge for interaction between a child with ASD and his typically developed sibling is for the first time described. Quantitative data and qualitative observations are presented. The paper concludes with a focus on the technical limitations and also on future developments and implications for the clinical use of Probogotchi game for children with autism. © 2016, ASCR Press.

This new landscape aesthetic was generally expressed in terms of the closely interrelated concepts of the sublime, the beautiful, and the picturesque. As a system of artistic, psychological, and philosophical references, the aesthetic fired the imaginations of many eighteenth-century British novelists, especially those who were turning their attention to a then-emerging fictional form, the Gothic novel. The ideas encompassed by this system of landscape aesthetics were perfect vehicles for these eighteenth-century stories of suspense and terror; and during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, this adaptable aesthetic continued to provide a common reference point for creators and readers of Gothic fiction. Even today, although we may not use the same terminology, landscape aesthetics based on the sublime, the beautiful, and the picturesque are still alive and well in popular culture. Many modern-day writers and artists who work in the Gothic tradition-from novelists to film makers to video game designers-continue to draw from the same aesthetic conventions. The plot constructs that thrill today’s audiences (attacks by space aliens; love stories of teenage vampires) differ from the constructs used by eighteenth-century authors (menacing, ghostly figures; terrified virgins fleeing would-be seducers). Nevertheless, the complex emotions-apprehension and terror, anticipation and pleasure-evoked by the best Gothic fictions have remained remarkably consistent.1 This chapter shows how some of the best-respected practitioners of Gothic have, over the years, used specific elements of an eighteenth-century aesthetic canon to produce specific emotional responses in their audience-that is, to produce the range of feelings that comprise the “delicious terror” of the true Gothic experience. © The Author(s) 2016.",,"English",Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018872152

Coexistence in schools inevitably implies conflicts among peers, which can have a negative impact inboth the students' well-being and their academic achievement. In this sense, the main objective of the present article is to introduce and describe the evaluation of the Training Program in Emotional Management Happy 8-12. This software focuses on the education of the pupils' emotional competences in order to solve conflicts in an assertive way. The program consists of 25 conflicts which students need to solve according to the management program of emotions developed by the Psychopedagogic Orientation Group (GROP). Method. The sample of the study consisted of 574 students of 5th and 6th grade of primary education. 301 of the participants were boys (52.4%) and 273 were girls (47.6%). Average age was 10.53, with a standard deviation of.662. The design employed in the present work was a quasi experimental design with pretest and posttest with a control group. The instruments and techniques used for the evaluation were: QDE, STAIC, CES, playground climate, anecdotic registration of conflict behaviours and academic performance. Results. Our results indicated that Happy 8-12 significantly improved the emotional competences of the students, reduced anxiety levels, and ameliorated the atmosphere in both the playground and in the class, noticeably augmenting the academic success. Conclusión. The results of this study show that training the management of emotions improves students' well-being at the same time that it acts as a preventive strategy for more severe disruptive behaviours, such as bullying. It also optimises the coexistence in the educative centres. © Education & Psychology I+D+i and Ilustre Colegio Oficial de la Psicología de Andalucía Oriental (Spain).",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85011086441

The main idea here is the great importance of a speech at the opening ceremony of a mega-event. The characteristics of the speech were analyzed through the speaker's choice of words (figures of speech and rhetorical devices). The role of the speech was analyzed to show how the main event concept is promoted. The research is divided into two parts. The first presents a review of the literature and of other relevant resources such as video material and web pages as a basis for preparing the theoretical part of the article. In the second, more empirically oriented part of the article, we conducted a linguistic analysis involving an indepth discourse analyses of John Furlong's speech and the analyses of syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. Through the review of the literature and of other resources, we have established the importance of an additional Olympic theme along with the main sport-related theme. The empirical research that is based on the discourse analyses shows that, despite its brevity, John Furlong's speech stresses the theme and the values of the mega-event, and it is also highly communicative, incorporating the various significant semantics and pragmatics of a good speech: Brevity, simple words and sentences, colloquial language, relating to the audiences, employing stylistic and grammatical devices, appealing to the audience's feelings and emotions, and the delivery with appropriate rhythm, emphasis, and pauses. When conducting the research, we were unable to identify any other studies that have undertaken a detailed analysis of this speech. There are numerous analyses of how the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympic Games were prepared and also staged. We have also found some that focused on the theme of the event, but none focused on how the message of the event was delivered to the general public and the residents of host communities.

We measured and analyzed the event related potential (ERP), including the N2 component, which has previously been linked to cognitive conflict from competing decision tendencies. In a modified Go/No-go task designed to trigger moral conflict participants had to shoot suddenly appearing human like avatars in a virtual reality scene. The scene was seen either from an ego perspective with targets appearing directly in front of the participant or from a bird's view, where targets were seen from above and more distant. To control for low level visual features, we added a visually identical control condition, where the instruction to ""shoot"" was replaced by an instruction to ""detect."" ERP waveforms showed differences between the two tasks as early as in the N1 time-range, with higher N1 amplitudes for the close perspective in the ""shoot"" task. Additionally, we found that pre-stimulus alpha power was significantly decreased in the ego, compared to the bird's view only for the ""shoot"" but not for the ""detect"" task. In the N2 time window, we observed main amplitude effects for response (No-go > Go) and distance (ego > bird perspective) but no interaction with task type (shoot vs. detect). We argue that the pre-stimulus and N1 effects can be explained by reduced attention and arousal in the distance condition when people are instructed to ""shoot.""

Unique in ELS is that children can learn mathematics, in their own remote village, without a teacher. This research study assessed the effectiveness of ELS in two pilots through a pretest– posttest control group quasi-experimental design. In Pilot I, 67 children in three remote villages, aged used the game for a period of six weeks, five days a week, 45 minutes a day; the control group did not receive any education.. In Pilot II, 591 children in 19 remote villages, played the game for six months, for a maximum of five times a week, 45 minutes a day; the control group received informal education in out-of-school centers. The results of the analysis on the pretest–posttest data revealed that ELS increased mathematics knowledge acquisition in numeracy and adding significantly and maintained student motivation to learn. Analyses of control group data and EGMA (internationally validates Early Grade Mathematics Assessment) showed that the children in the experimental group learned more than children who received no education at all, informal or formal education. These findings suggest that the implementation of ELS can greatly benefit learning for out-of-school children like in Sudan. © ACPIL.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84968901921

Population-based data on these behaviors at the national, state, and local levels can help monitor the effectiveness of public health interventions designed to protect and promote the health of youth nationwide. Reporting Period Covered: September 2014-December 2015. Description of the System: The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) monitors six categories of priority health behaviors among youth and young adults: 1) behaviors that contribute to unintentional injuries and violence; 2) tobacco use; 3) alcohol and other drug use; 4) sexual behaviors related to unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; 5) unhealthy dietary behaviors; and 6) physical inactivity. In addition, YRBSS monitors the prevalence of obesity and asthma and other priority health behaviors. YRBSS includes a national school-based Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) conducted by CDC and state and large urban school district school-based YRBSs conducted by state and local education and health agencies. This report summarizes results for 118 health behaviors plus obesity, overweight, and asthma from the 2015 national survey, 37 state surveys, and 19 large urban school district surveys conducted among students in grades 9-12. Results: Results from the 2015 national YRBS indicated that many high school students are engaged in priority health-risk behaviors associated with the leading causes of death among persons aged 10-24 years in the United States. During the 30 days before the survey, 41.5% of high school students nationwide among the 61.3% who drove a car or other vehicle during the 30 days before the survey had texted or e-mailed while driving, 32.8% had drunk alcohol, and 21.7% had used marijuana. During the 12 months before the survey, 15.5% had been electronically bullied, 20.2% had been bullied on school property, and 8.6% had attempted suicide. Many high school students are engaged in sexual risk behaviors related to unintended pregnancies and STIs, including HIV infection. Nationwide, 41.2% of students had ever had sexual intercourse, 30.1% had had sexual intercourse during the 3 months before the survey (i.e., currently sexually active), and 11.5% had had sexual intercourse with four or more persons during their life. Among currently sexually active students, 56.9% had used a condom during their last sexual intercourse. Results from the 2015 national YRBS also indicated many high school students are engaged in behaviors associated with chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes. During the 30 days before the survey, 10.8% of high school students had smoked cigarettes and 7.3% had used smokeless tobacco. During the 7 days before the survey, 5.2% of high school students had not eaten fruit or drunk 100% fruit juices and 6.7% had not eaten vegetables. More than one third (41.7%) had played video or computer games or used a computer for something that was not school work for 3 or more hours per day on an average school day and 14.3% had not participated in at least 60 minutes of any kind of physical activity that increased their heart rate and made them breathe hard on at least 1 day during the 7 days before the survey. Further, 13.9% had obesity and 16.0% were overweight. Interpretation: Many high school students engage in behaviors that place them at risk for the leading causes of morbidity and mortality. The prevalence of most health behaviors varies by sex, race/ethnicity, and grade and across states and large urban school districts. Long-term temporal changes also have occurred. Since the earliest year of data collection, the prevalence of most healthrisk behaviors has decreased (e.g., riding with a driver who had been drinking alcohol, physical fighting, current cigarette use, current alcohol use, and current sexual activity), but the prevalence of other behaviors and health outcomes has not changed (e.g., uicide attempts treated by a doctor or nurse, smokeless tobacco use, having ever used marijuana, and attending physical education classes) or has increased (e.g., having not gone to school because of safety concerns, obesity, overweight, not eating vegetables, and not drinking milk). Monitoring emerging risk behaviors (e.g., texting and driving, bullying, and electronic vapor product use) is important to understand how they might vary over time. Public Health Action: YRBSS data are used widely to compare the prevalence of health behaviors among subpopulations of students; assess trends in health behaviors over time; monitor progress toward achieving 21 national health objectives for Healthy People 2020 and one of the 26 leading health indicators; provide comparable state and large urban school district data; and help develop and evaluate school and community policies, programs, and practices designed to decrease health-risk behaviors and improve health outcomes among youth.",27280474,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84981351779

Its goal is the development of services that are able to manage themselves with minimal direct human intervention, and, in particular, are able to sense their environment and to tune themselves to meet end-user needs. However, the impact on performance of the interaction between multiple uncoordinated self-optimizing services is not yet well understood. We present some recent results on a non-cooperative load-balancing game which help to better understand the result of this interaction. In this game, users generate jobs of different services, and the jobs have to be processed on one of the servers of a computing platform. Each service has its own dispatcher which probabilistically routes jobs to servers so as to minimize the mean processing cost of its own jobs. We first investigate the impact of heterogeneity in the amount of incoming traffic routed by dispatchers and present a result stating that, for a fixed amount of total incoming traffic, the worst-case overall performance occurs when each dispatcher routes the same amount of traffic. Using this result we then study the so-called Price of Anarchy (PoA), an oft-used worst-case measure of the inefficiency of non-cooperative decentralized architectures. We give explicit bounds on the PoA for cost functions representing the mean delay of jobs when the service discipline is PS or SRPT. These bounds indicate that significant performance degradations can result from the selfish behavior of self-optimizing services. In practice, though, the worst-case scenario may occur rarely, if at all. Some recent results suggest that for the game under consideration the PoA is an overly pessimistic measure that does not reflect the performance obtained in most instances of the problem. © Cambridge University Press 2016.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84969871873

The target application is the design of highly-customized products together with the final users, more specifically the design of walking assistive devices with mobility-impaired people. The tool has simultaneously been developed with an ad-hoc protocol for an accurate evaluation of the satisfaction of users, through questionnaires and psychophysiological measurements. In fact, costly and complex technical products such as walking assistance devices require ad-hoc design processes to address the specific needs of each user. The characterization of user requirements in the early stage of design remains difficult due to their subjective and communication gap between the user and the designer. To overcome these issues, we propose a new modular digital toolbox that allows co-design between users and designers. The tool is a combination of a mixed reality hardware/software system and kansei (or affective) engineering techniques. The hardware consists of modular Tangible User Interfaces (TUIs), custom-made by 3D printing and powered by a 3D game engine.

The amygdala signals reward and punishment, as well as facial expressions and the gaze of others. Amygdala damage impairs social interactions, and the social neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) influences human social decisions, in part, by altering amygdala function. Here we show inmonkeys playing amodified dictator game, inwhich one individual can donate or withhold rewards from another, that basolateral amygdala (BLA) neurons signaled social preferences both across trials and across days. BLA neurons mirrored the value of rewards delivered to self and others when monkeys were free to choose but not when the computer made choices for them. We also found that focal infusion of OT unilaterally into BLA weakly but significantly increased both the frequency of prosocial decisions and attention to recipients for context-specific prosocial decisions, endorsing the hypothesis that OT regulates social behavior, in part, via amygdala neuromodulation.

Consider that sensor nodes are self-interested to maximize their own utilities, we formulate the energy-efficient power allocation problem as a non-cooperative coupled constraint game, by taking the interference temperature into account. An energy efficiency-oriented utility function is defined as a new metric to evaluate the performance of power allocation. Firstly, we prove that there exist Nash equilibriums in the proposed game. Then, we prove that the power allocation game is a super-modular game under some conditions. Finally, we design centralized and distributed Game-based Efficiency-oriented Power Allocation algorithms (i.e., centralized GEPA and distributed GEPA) to obtain the Nash equilibriums. Extensive simulations are conducted to demonstrate that the proposed power allocation algorithms can achieve satisfactory performance in terms of energy efficiency, convergence speed and fairness in cognitive sensor networks. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84930871370

Time (h/d) spent in SBBs was obtained using a parent proxy-report questionnaire. Anthropometrics, blood pressure (BP), and lipids were measured using standard techniques. A clustered CVD risk score was calculated as the average of the standardized values of the subcomponents (waist circumference [WC], systolic BP, diastolic BP, and lipids).RESULTS: After adjusting for sex, parent education, physical activity (accelerometry), diet, and WC (when adiposity was not the outcome), television viewing time was positively associated with body mass index z-score (P = .002), WC (P = .02), and systolic BP (P = .05). Electronic games was positively associated with low density lipoprotein levels (P = .05), and total screen-time was positively associated with body mass index (P = .02).CONCLUSIONS: Differential associations were observed between types of SBBs and CVD risk factors, indicating that not all SBBs are adversely associated with obesity and CVD risk.

An additional goal was to investigate the effects of the adaptive game on the players' motivation. Materials and Methods: A two-phase approach (calibration and exercise phase) was applied in a sample of 16 physically active adults. In the cardio-exergame ""LetterBird,"" the flight of a pigeon was controlled by the pedaling rate of a bike ergometer as input device. During the calibration phase the individual heart rate (HR) responses of the players were measured. In the exercise phase, these data were used to adjust the resistance of the ergometer using the proposed algorithm. The purpose of this algorithm was to induce an individually defined target HR and to keep it in a steady state. In order to establish a reference for further studies, the game experience was measured using the kids-Game Experience Questionnaire. Results: In 15 of 16 participants the actual HR reached the intended individual HR range within 10 minutes after onset of exercise. However, the induced HR initially exceeded the target HR in 13 participants, which made load adjustments necessary. The analysis of the kids-Game Experience Questionnaire confirmed the motivational effect of the exergame ""LetterBird."" Conclusions: The results confirm that the proposed algorithm for personalized HR control in the game ""LetterBird"" is feasible. Furthermore, the cardio-exergame ""LetterBird"" seems to have a substantial short-term motivating effect. © Copyright 2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",26484388,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84994051925

We assume that such multimodal streams are available to a baby through inborn reflexes, self-supervision, and caretaker's supervision, when the baby interacts with the real world. By autonomous development, we mean that not only that the internal (inside the 'skull') self-organization is fully autonomous, but the developmental program (DP) that regulates the computation of the network is also task nonspecific. In this work, the task-nonspecificity is reflected by the fact that the actions associated with an attended object in a cluttered, natural, and dynamic scene is taught after the DP is finished and the 'life' has begun. The actions correspond to neuronal firing patterns representing object type, object location and object scale, but learning is directly from unsegmented cluttered scenes. Along the line of where-what networks (WWN), this is the first one that explicitly models multiple 'brain' areas - each for a different range of object scales.

To show the power of automatic attention in unknown cluttered backgrounds, the last experimental group demonstrated disjoint tests in the presence of large within-class variations (object 3-D-rotations in very different unknown backgrounds), but small between-class variations (small object patches in large similar and different unknown backgrounds), in contrast with global classification tests such as ImageNet and Atari Games. © 2015 IEEE.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84961806973

The architectures of agents have enormous potentials when they are applied into critical systems, where agents choose actions between working with their own and cooperating with others. Rational utility-based agents choose actions to maximize their expected utilities. Rational secure multi-party computing (RSMPC) means secure multi-party computing (SMPC) in the presence of rational utility-based agents. Here, we call them rational parties. In this paper certain goals of rational parties are maximizing their utilities. The introduction of rational parties considers the incentives in executing protocols. The security definitions under rational framework can better demonstrate the executing environment of real protocols. Furthermore, rational two-party computing removes some impossibility in traditional two-party computing, such as fairness. This paper represents the research status of RSMPC and some typical protocols. The advantages and disadvantages of previous rational SMPC protocols are discussed here. As an emerging field, there are still lots of open problems in RSMPC, such as communication channels, utility assumptions and equilibrium notions etc. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84947051070

An increasing sedentary way of life is directly related to obesity; hence, prevention and management of childhood obesity are commonly based on lifestyle interventions wherein increasing physical activity is one of the main targets. The use of exergames can be useful in promoting physical activity, but it is necessary more research. This study analyzes the effects of an exergaming platform that involves brisk walking, on perceived exertion, self-efficacy, positive expectations and satisfaction in a sample of clinically obese children, as compared with normal weight children. Physiological variables like heart rate, oxygen consumption and energy expenditure were also measured. Method: A total sample of 42 children was recruited. Children were randomized into those walking on a treadmill and those using a treadmill with the support of the exergaming platform (Wii-Fit). Results: The obese children scored significantly higher in expectations and satisfaction in the exergame condition but not in self-efficacy, perceived exertion or physiological measures. Conclusions: These results suggest that this exergaming platform could be a tool to assist obese children in the practice of brisk walking as part of a programme designed to treat obesity. © 2015, Grupo Aula Medica S.A.

However, the quality of data from PET brain studies is often limited by subject motion during acquisition. This is particularly challenging for patients with neurological disorders or with dynamic research studies that can last 90 min or more. Restraining head movement during the scan does not eliminate motion entirely and can be unpleasant for the subject. Head motion can be detected and measured using a variety of techniques that either use the PET data itself or an external tracking system. Advances in computer vision arising from the video gaming industry could offer significant benefits when re-purposed for medical applications. A method for measuring rigid body type head motion using the Microsoft Kinect v2 is described with results presenting 0.5 mm spatial accuracy. Motion data is measured in real-time at 30 Hz using the KinectFusion algorithm. Non-rigid motion is detected using the residual alignment energy data of the KinectFusion algorithm allowing for unreliable motion to be discarded.

GoFAR is a novel, 3-part intervention designed to improve self-regulation and adaptive living skills of children with FASD by improving metacognitive control of emotions and arousal.METHODS: The intervention has 3 components: (i) GoFAR: a ""serious game"" designed to teach a metacognitive control strategy in a computer game environment; (ii) parent training on child behavioral regulation; and (iii) Behavior Analog Therapy (BAT) sessions, a practical application of the metacognitive learning methodology by parent and child in the context of learning adaptive skills. The learning strategy (FAR) teaches the child to Focus and make a plan, Act out the plan, and Reflect back on the plan. Thirty families were randomized to 3 groups: (i) GoFAR (n = 10); (ii) FACELAND (n = 10); or (iii) CONTROL (n = 10). The 2 intervention groups, GoFAR and FACELAND, used computer games to instruct children. Both groups also received 5 sessions of parent training followed by 5 sessions of joint parent/child therapy (BAT). Assessment of disruptive behavior, including frequency of temper tantrums, frustration tolerance, impulsivity, destructiveness, aggression, and maintaining attention were carried out before enrollment at Mid-Treatment, when game play and parent training were completed, and finally, after completing the BAT sessions.RESULTS: Parental report of disruptive behavior overall was significantly reduced in the GoFAR group after the first components, game play and parent training, and after the BAT sessions in the FACELAND group with no changes in the CONTROL group over time.CONCLUSIONS: The GoFAR(®) game was well received by children and effective in teaching the required skills. Mastering the FAR metacognitive strategy was associated with a reduction in disruptive behaviors in children with FASD suggesting that effective interventions can improve outcomes for this high-risk group.

Its effective administration can significantly increase the chances of survival for victims of cardiac arrest. LISSA is a serious game designed to complement CPR teaching and also to refresh CPR skills in an enjoyable way. The game presents an emergency situation in a 3D virtual environment and the player has to save the victim applying the CPR actions. In this paper, we describe LISSA and its evaluation in a population composed of 109 nursing undergraduate students enrolled in the Nursing degree of our university. To evaluate LISSA we performed a randomized controlled trial that compares the classical teaching methodology, composed of self-directed learning for theory plus laboratory sessions with a mannequin for practice, with the one that uses LISSA after self-directed learning for theory and before laboratory sessions with a mannequin. From our evaluation we observed that students using LISSA (Group 2 and 3) gave significantly better learning acquisition scores than those following traditional classes (Group 1). To evaluate the differences between students of these groups we performed a paired samples t-test between Group 1 and 2 (μ1=35, 67, μ2=47, 50 and p&lt;0.05) and between students of Group 1 and 3 (μ1=35, 67, μ3=50, 58 and p&lt;0.05). From these tests we observed that there are significant differences in both cases. We also evaluated student performance of main steps of CPR protocol.

Recent evidence suggests that the hypocretin system has significant projections to this reward system. We examined the distinct effects of reduced dopamine or reduced hypocretin levels on reward activity in patients with Parkinson's disease, dopamine deficient, as well as patients with narcolepsy-cataplexy, hypocretin depleted, and healthy controls. Participants performed a simple game-like task while high-density electroencephalography was recorded. Topography and timing of event-related potentials for both reward cue, and reward feedback was examined across the entire dataset. While response to reward cue was similar in all groups, two distinct time points were found to distinguish patients and controls for reward feedback. Around 160ms both patient groups had reduced ERP amplitude compared to controls. Later at 250ms, both patient groups also showed a clear event-related potential (ERP), which was absent in controls. The initial differences show that both patient groups show a similar, blunted response to reward delivery. The second potential corresponds to the classic feedback-related negativity (FRN) potential which relies on dopamine activity and reflects reward prediction-error signaling. In particular the mismatch between predicted reward and reward subsequently received was significantly higher in PD compared to NC, independent of reward magnitude and valence. The intermediate FRN response in NC highlights the contribution of hypocretin in reward processing, yet also shows that this is not as detrimental to the reward system as in Parkinson's. Furthermore, the inability to generate accurate predictions in NC may explain why hypocretin deficiency mediates cataplexy triggered by both positive and negative emotions. © 2015 Mensen et al.

When these reference waveforms (typically accelerations) are used for such testing, significant rotational motion of the test system's shake table can occur. As a result, the X, Y, and Z control transducers that are mounted on the surface of the table will no longer be aligned with the world (fixed) coordinate system as the table rotates about X, Y, and Z, but rather with respect to the shake table's body (moving) coordinate system. This lack of alignment with respect to the world coordinate system in turn causes geometric distortion in the output of the control accelerometers that are required to control such MDOF tests. These errors can cause further errors in the control system's ability to reproduce the motion specified by the test's reference waveforms with respect to the world coordinate system as required by the seismic test specifications. Similar problems can also occur in other such applications of MDOF testing with reference acceleration waveforms that similarly produces significant roll, pitch, or yaw rotations with their tests.

The aims of this study were to examine associations of parental rules and parental style of communication with children's screen time and perceived excessive screen time in five European countries. Methods: UP4FUN was a multi-centre, cluster randomised controlled trial with pre- and post-test measurements in each of five countries; Belgium, Germany, Greece, Hungary and Norway. Questionnaires were completed by the children at school and the parent questionnaire was brought home. Three structural equation models were tested based on measures of screen time and parental style of communication from the pre-test questionnaires. Discussion: Of the 152 schools invited, 62 (41 %) schools agreed to participate. In total 3325 children (average age 11.2 years and 51 % girls) and 3038 parents (81 % mothers) completed the pre-test questionnaire. The average TV/DVD times across the countries were between 1.5 and 1.8 h/day, while less time was used for computer/games console (0.9-1.4 h/day). The children's perceived parental style of communication was quite consistent for TV/DVD and computer/games console. The presence of rules was significantly associated with less time watching TV/DVD and use of computer/games console time. Moreover, the use of an autonomy-supportive style was negatively related to both time watching TV/DVD and use of computer/games console time. The use of a controlling style was related positively to perceived excessive time used on TV/DVD and excessive time used on computer/games console. With a few exceptions, results were similar across the five countries. Conclusions: This study suggests that an autonomy-supportive style of communicating rules for TV/DVD or computer/ games console use is negatively related to children's time watching TV/DVD and use of computer/games console time. In contrast, a controlling style is associated with more screen time and with more perceived excessive screen time in particular.

In a repeated measures experiment, seven experienced players played five popular dance exer-games on separate days. Exertion was measured using indirect calorimetry. Hedonic experience was measured using questions about engagement and game-flow. Platform and software usability was determined by questionnaire and percent time spent in non-play activities (menu interfaces, software loading). Mean MET levels ranged from 4.26 to 9.18 during gameplay, depending on the game. Player engagement and game-flow were closely related to MET activity. Usability scores were closely related to time spent in non-play activities. Games with increased MET levels and higher usability scores were reflected in higher engagement and game-flow scores. Degree of interface embodiment did not affect these outcomes. Based on these results, problems in usability are barriers to engagement. Designing games that provide a balance of challenge, immersion, and engagement is a difficult task. These results demonstrate the importance of examining players of varying skill levels in order to fully understand the interaction of physical exertion, platform usability and player engagement. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929303172

Youths with externalizing problems are also frequently comorbid with anxiety. Among the most widely recognized evidence-based treatments is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Although CBT principles seem to be sound, effect sizes remain moderate, suggesting improvements could be made to this conventional treatment approach. The main premise of the current pilot study is to investigate the feasibility of implementing a videogame intervention (""Dojo"" [Gamedesk, Los Angeles, CA]) that incorporates CBT principles and aims to address the limitations of conventional CBT delivery models, with the ultimate goal of improving outcomes for this difficult-to-treat population. Materials and Methods: ""Dojo"" is an emotion management game that helps youths to recognize and control their physiological and emotional arousal. We explored the implementation and user experience of ""Dojo"" in a sample of eight adolescents in residential treatment for both externalizing and anxiety problems. Results: Participants attended all sessions without complaints. They evaluated ""Dojo"" very positively and exhibited high compliance during the training sessions. We encountered some problems with session scheduling and obtaining mentor reports. Quantitative data show the predicted decrease in three out of four measurements. Conclusions: The smooth implementation, high user satisfaction, high self-reported compliance during training sessions, and initial outcome results all indicate the high potential ""Dojo"" holds as an innovative intervention. If additional rigorously designed randomized controlled trials prove to be successful, ""Dojo"" can be a cost-effective way to engage high-risk youths in effective intervention. © Copyright 2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2015.",26287930,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84992699411

Sample entropy (SampEn) was computed to assess autonomic regularity, and cross-SampEn was calculated to quantify autonomic coordination. Results: During video game play, reduced cardiorespiratory coupling (CRC) was observed in individuals with PIU excessive gaming type compared with controls, implicating central autonomic dysregulation. The PIU tendency was associated with the severity of autonomic dysregulation.

Because of the associations screen time has with dietary intake, diet may be an important factor in the screen time and health relationship; however, evidence has not previously been synthesized. Thus, the aim of this systematic review was to explore whether the associations between various sedentary behaviours and cardiometabolic risk markers are independent of dietary intake in adolescents. Online databases and personal libraries were searched for peer-reviewed original research articles published in English before March 2014. Included studies assessed associations between sedentary behaviour and cardiometabolic markers in 12- to 18-year-olds and adjusted for dietary intake. Twenty-five studies met the inclusion criteria. From the 21 studies examining sedentary behaviour and adiposity, the majority found significant positive associations between television viewing, screen time and self-reported overall sedentary behaviour with markers of adiposity, independent of dietary intake. No significant associations between screen time with blood pressure and cholesterol were reported. Sedentary behaviour appears to be associated with adiposity in adolescents, irrespective of dietary intake. However, the variability of dietary variables between studies suggests further work is needed to understand the role of dietary intake when examining these associations in youth. © 2015 World Obesity.",26098509,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84938745436

Sport performers must manage a range of pressures and psychological responses if they are to fulfil their potential. Consider the case of Rebecca Adlington: during the Beijing Olympic Games (2008) she became the first British woman to win two Olympic swimming gold medals. Four years later, at the London 2012 Olympic Games, Rebecca talked about the pressures of trying to emulate her 2008 success while competing at a home games: The most I've ever competed in front of at home is 2,500. I'm not used to that crowd reaction coming out . . . maybe it's a little bit overwhelming for us all . . . I think the pressure, the expectation and everything going into this meet has been a little bit of a battle.1 Being able to successfully help individuals fulfil their potential presents an ambitious objective for someone in any profession. In sport, as illustrated above, there may be occasions where an athlete's mind is invaded by unpleasant thoughts and emotions that are associated with perceiving competition as a huge pressure. High-profile examples such as Rebecca's could represent the tip of a metaphoric iceberg whereby the pressures of achieving and maintaining sporting excellence may lead to unhappiness and underperformance. Where individuals are unable to effectively cope with such pressures, they are likely to experience poor performance, feel dissatisfied with their experiences and possibly drop out of sport (Sagar et al., 2009; Voight, 2009). Research indicates that, as well as experiencing stressors resulting directly from the sport organization (selection pressures, personal performance), athletes may at the same time be experiencing academic, employment, developmental and social stressors (Devonport and Lane, 2009; Devonport et al., 2013; Smetana et al., 2006; Sullivan and Nashman, 1998). Sport stressors (such as selection issues or training demands) and nonsport stressors (such as relationship issues or exam pressures) may occur independently of each other, or may co-occur and/or interact. Any one stressor or combination of stressors has the potential to challenge an athlete's ability to cope and, ultimately, may influence their ability to train and compete optimally. Rebecca Adlington illustrated the challenges of managing combined stressors during a television interview recorded in December 2009 with the BBC.2 Within this interview, she comments: It's been hard for me to deal with everything after Beijing, like being recognised, and there are other things like moving house and personal situations, your swimming gets affected by that . . . Growing up, it's hard enough to deal with change anyway, with your body shape, and changing as a woman. A responsibility for researchers and applied practitioners alike is to seek to understand the environments in which athletes operate, and identify and develop strategies to manage stressors. Enhancing coping skills that could be used to manage stress in different domains of an athlete's life is a strategy that is worth pursuing. The development of generic coping-skill interventions may help attenuate stressors and facilitate the achievement of personal goals across domains (Smith, 1999). © 2016 Andrew M. Lane.

Design A randomized, controlled, single-blinded clinical trial was carried out. Thirty-six children with moderate to severe asthma were randomly allocated to either a video game group (VGG; N = 20) or a treadmill group (TG; n = 16). Both groups completed an eight-week supervised program with two weekly 40-minute sessions. Pre-training and post-training evaluations involved the Asthma Control Questionnaire, exhaled nitric oxide levels (FeNO), maximum exercise testing (Bruce protocol) and lung function. Results No differences between the VGG and TG were found at the baseline. Improvements occurred in both groups with regard to asthma control and exercise capacity. Moreover, a significant reduction in FeNO was found in the VGG (p < 0.05). Although the mean energy expenditure at rest and during exercise training was similar for both groups, the maximum energy expenditure was higher in the VGG. Conclusion The present findings strongly suggest that aerobic training promoted by an active video game had a positive impact on children with asthma in terms of clinical control, improvementin their exercise capacity and a reductionin pulmonary inflammation.

It has recently been hypothesized that ""social pain,"" as induced by social rejection or abandonment, may rely on comparable, phylogenetically old brain structures. As plausible as this theory may sound, scientific evidence for this idea is sparse. This study therefore attempts to link both types of pain directly. We studied patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) because BPD is characterized by opposing alterations in physical and social pain; hyposensitivity to physical pain is associated with hypersensitivity to social pain, as indicated by an enhanced rejection sensitivity. Method: Twenty unmedicated female BPD patients and 20 healthy participants (HC, matched for age and education) played a virtual ball-tossing game (cyberball), with the conditions for exclusion, inclusion, and a control condition with predefined game rules. Each cyberball block was followed by a temperature stimulus (with a subjective pain intensity of 60% in half the cases). The cerebral responses were measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging. The Adult Rejection Sensitivity Questionnaire was used to assess rejection sensitivity. Results: Higher temperature heat stimuli had to be applied to BPD patients relative to HCs to reach a comparable subjective experience of painfulness in both groups, which suggested a general hyposensitivity to pain in BPD patients. Social exclusion led to a subjectively reported hypersensitivity to physical pain in both groups that was accompanied by an enhanced activation in the anterior insula and the thalamus. In BPD, physical pain processing after exclusion was additionally linked to enhanced posterior insula activation. After inclusion, BPD patients showed reduced amygdala activation during pain in comparison with HC. In BPD patients, higher rejection sensitivity was associated with lower activation differences during pain processing following social exclusion and inclusion in the insula and in the amygdala. Discussion: Despite the similar behavioral effects in both groups, BPD patients differed from HC in their neural processing of physical pain depending on the preceding social situation. Rejection sensitivity further modulated the impact of social exclusion on neural pain processing in BPD, but not in healthy controls. Copyright: © 2015 Bungert et al.

Since the emergence of this educational trend, called digital game-based learning, several studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect that learning or recreational video games have had on learners and on their mastery of learning objectives. Many of these studies have focused on specific sets of skills that specific video games can promote. Nevertheless, there is evidence that any type of video game, regardless of its learning or recreational nature, can help students develop certain knowledge, skills, and attitudes (KSAs) that could be useful for engineering courses and projects. This evidence also suggests that digital game-based learning contributes to 21st-century skills that are necessary for competitive engineering professionals. This literature review will describe the KSAs that could be promoted in constructivist-oriented classrooms when learners engage in any type of video game. This research paper will focus on how engineering students can develop 21st-century KSAs that are implicit in each gaming opportunity, such as high-order thinking and decision-making skills, persistence, socialization, leadership skills, self-confidence, and autonomy and self-regulation. © 2013 IEEE.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84946741292

Although these AVGs are similar, the style of gameplay required is different (i.e., upper body only versus total body movements) and may alter physical activity intensity and one's preference for playing one game over the other. AVGs that elicit the greatest physiologic challenge and are preferred by users should be identified in an effort to enhance the efficacy of physical activity interventions and programs that include AVGs. Materials and Methods: The mean heart rate (HRmean) and peak heart rate (HRpeak) for 27 adults (22.7±4.2 years old) were recorded during four 10-minute conditions: seated rest, treadmill walking at 3 miles/hour, ""Wii Boxing,"" and ""Kinect Boxing."" Upon completion of all four conditions, participants indicated which condition they preferred, and HRmean and HRpeak were calculated as a percentage of age-predicted maximum heart rate to classify physical activity intensity for the three activity conditions (treadmill, ""Wii Boxing,"" and ""Kinect Boxing""). Results: ""Kinect Boxing"" significantly (P&lt;0.001) increased percentage HRmean (64.1±1.6 percent of age-predicted maximum) and percentage HRpeak (76.5±1.9 percent) above all other conditions: Wii HRmean, 53.0±1.2 percent; Wii HRpeak, 61.8±1.5 percent; treadmill HRmean, 52.4±1.2 percent; treadmill HRpeak, 55.2±2.2 percent. Percentage HRpeak for ""Kinect Boxing"" was great enough to be considered a vigorous-intensity physical activity. There was no difference (P=0.55) in percentage HRmean between ""Wii Boxing"" and treadmill walking. Participants also preferred ""Kinect Boxing"" (P&lt;0.001; n=26) to all other conditions (""Wii Boxing,"" n=1; treadmill n=0). Conclusions: ""Kinect Boxing"" was the most preferred and the only condition that was physiologically challenging enough to be classified as a vigorous-intensity physical activity. © Copyright 2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2015.",26182213,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84992739286

The method was developed to analyze the video recordings of facial expressions depicted during a collaborative game played as a part of the Mars-500 experiment. In this experiment, six astronauts were isolated for 520 days in a space station to simulate a flight to Mars. Seven time-dependent components of facial expressions were extracted from the video recordings of the experiment. To interpret these dynamic components, we proposed a mathematical model of emotional events. Genetic programming was used to find the locations, types, and intensities of the emotional events as well as the way the recorded facial expressions represented reactions to them. By classification of different statistical properties of the data, we found that there are significant relations between the facial expressions of different crew members and a memory effect between the collective emotional states of the crew members. The model of emotional events was validated on previously unseen video recordings of the astronauts. We demonstrated that both genetic search and optimization of the parameters improve the accuracy of the proposed model. This method is a step toward automating the analysis of affective expressions in terms of the cognitive appraisal theory of emotion, which relies on the dependence of the expressed emotion on the causing event. © 2013 IEEE.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84937570845

Here, we studied the precise temporal and spectral pattern of reward-related signals in the human Nacc. We recorded local field potentials (LFPs) from the Nacc of six epilepsy patients during an economic decision-making task. On each trial, patients decided whether to accept or reject a gamble with equal probabilities of a monetary gain or loss. The behavior of four patients was consistent with choices being guided by value expectations. Expected value signals before outcome onset were observed in three of those patients, at varying latencies and with nonoverlapping spectral patterns. Signals after outcome onset were correlated with RPE regressors in all subjects. However, further analysis revealed that these signals were better explained as outcome valence rather than RPE signals, with gamble gains and losses differing in the power of beta oscillations and in evoked response amplitudes. Taken together, our results do not support the idea that postsynaptic potentials in the Nacc represent a RPE that unifies outcome magnitude and prior value expectation. We discuss the generalizability of our findings to healthy individuals and the relation of our results to measurements of RPE signals obtained from the Nacc with other methods. © 2015 the American Physiological Society.",26019312,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84938567388

Each tournament provides realtime content, including streaming video, game statistics, scores, images, schedule of play, and text. Due to the game popularities, some of the web servers are heavily visited and some are not, therefore, we need a method to autonomously provision servers to provide a smooth user experience. Predictive Cloud Computing (PCC) has been developed to provide a smart allocation/deallocation of servers by combining ensembles of forecasts and predictive modeling to determine the future origin demand for web site content. PCC distributes processing through analytical pipelines that correlate streaming data, such as scores, media schedules, and player brackets with a future-siμlated tournament state to measure predicted demand spikes for content. Social data streamed from Twitter provides social sentiment and popularity features used within predictive modeling. Data at rest, such as machine logs and web content, provide additional features for forecasting. While the duration of each tournament varies, the number of origin website requests range from 29,000 to 110,000 hits per minute. The PCC technology was developed and deployed to all Grand Slam tennis events and several major golf tournaments that took place in 2013 and to the present, which has decreased wasted computing consumption by over 50%. We propose a novel forecasting ensemble that includes residual, vector, historical, partial, adjusted, cubic and quadratic forecasters. In addition, we present several predictive models based on μltiple Regression as inputs into several of these forecasters. We conclude by empirically demonstrating that the predictive cloud technology is able to forecast the computing load on origin web servers for professional golf and tennis tournaments. © 2005-2012 IEEE.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84937776204

In this paper, we therefore examine the possibility to control a third robotic hand with one foot's movements. Three experiments in virtual reality were designed to assess the feasibility of this control strategy, the learning curve of the subjects in different tasks and the coordination of foot movements with the two natural hands. Results show that the limbs are moved simultaneously, in parallel rather than serially. Participants' performance improved within a few minutes of practice without any specific difficulty to complete the tasks. Subjective assessment by the subjects indicated that controlling a third hand by foot has been easy and required only negligible physical and mental efforts. The sense of ownership was reported to improve through the experiments. The mental burden was not directly related to the level of motion required by a task, but depended on the type of activity and practice. The most difficult task was moving two hands and foot in opposite directions. These results suggest that a combination of practice and appropriate tasks can enhance the learning process for controlling a robotic hand by foot. © 2015 Abdi et al.",26225938,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84941979034

This interdisciplinary study employed a within-participant design to explore the effects of two different types of online videogames (an action videogame and a non-action videogame) on subsequent creativity performance measured using an idea generation task and emotional responses. Results showed that after playing the action game participants performed higher on originality, elaboration and flexibility than after playing the non-action game, but not productivity. Furthermore, playing both types of game elicited positive emotion (i.e., pleasantness) high in approach motivation (i.e., desire). However, action video game play elicited higher arousal and stress than non-action videogame play. The current research suggests that the relationships between the quantity (productivity and flexibility) and the quality (in this paper, originality and elaboration) of creativity performance may be complex and emotional response of arousal might be a significant emotional factor which influences subsequent creativity performance after videogame play. The cognitive and emotional effects of videogames are discussed along with implications for future emotion-creativity-videogame research. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84937938797

Stability of objective SB and nonschool self-reported SB were also assessed at different time points during 1 academic year. Method: Starting with a total of 829 participants and after applying inclusion criteria, objective SB was assessed for 646 adolescents (Mage = 14.30 ± 0.71 years) with GT3X accelerometers for 7 days at 2 time points. Nonschool self-reported SB was measured for 781 adolescents (Mage = 14.46 ± 0.76 years) at 3 time points by means of a questionnaire. Data were analyzed using multiple regression analysis. Results: Gender and ambient temperature emerged as the main statistically significant correlates in all objective SB models, showing higher objective SB levels in girls and lower objective SB levels when ambient temperature was higher. According to nonschool self-reported SB, a gender effect was found in almost all behaviors. Whereas boys spent more time playing with video games as well as games on their mobile phones, girls spent more time studying and using their computers and mobile phones to communicate with each other. The findings showed a statistically significant city effect on study time (Huesca > Tarbes) and video games and telephone communication time (Tarbes > Huesca). Conclusion: Nonschool self-reported SB patterns were different in Huesca and Tarbes.

Previous studies have suggested that flow may be associated with a non-reciprocal coactivation of the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems and, on a cortical level, with a state of hypofrontality and implicit processing. Here, we test these hypotheses, using the computer game TETRIS as model task. The participants (n= 77) played TETRIS under three conditions that differed in difficulty (Easy < Optimal < Difficult). Cardiac and respiratory activities, and the average oxygenation changes of the prefrontal cortex were measured continuously with functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) during performance. The Optimal condition was characterized by the highest levels of state flow, positive affect, and effortless attention. The associations between self-reported psychological flow and physiological measures were investigated using a series of repeated measures linear mixed model analyses. The results showed that higher flow was associated with larger respiratory depth and lower LF. The higher respiratory depth during high flow is indicative of a more relaxed state with an increased parasympathetic activity, and thus provides partial support for the main hypotheses. There was no association between frontal cortical oxygenation and flow, even at liberal thresholds; i.e. we found no support that flow is related to a state of hypofrontality. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",25956190,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929147581

Given the prevailing evidence that these benefits result from efficient control of attentional processes, there has been growing interest in using action video games as a general tool to enhance everyday attentional control. However, to date, there is little evidence indicating that the benefits of action video game playing scale up to complex settings with socially meaningful stimuli - one of the fundamental components of our natural environment. The present experiment compared action video game player (AVGP) and non-video game player (NVGP) performance on an oculomotor capture task that presented participants with face stimuli. In addition, the expression of a distractor face was manipulated to assess if action video game experience modulated the effect of emotion. Results indicate that AVGPs experience less oculomotor capture than NVGPs; an effect that was not influenced by the emotional content depicted by distractor faces. It is noteworthy that this AVGP advantage emerged despite participants being unaware that the investigation had to do with video game playing, and participants being equivalent in their motivation and treatment of the task as a game. The results align with the notion that action video game experience is associated with superior attentional and oculomotor control, and provides evidence that these benefits can generalize to more complex and biologically relevant stimuli. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",26071923,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84930933196

We are interested in such variability because we believe it is an important part of the overall picture of attention that, if understood, has the potential to improve intervention for those with attentional deficits. Genetic association studies are valuable in discovering biological pathways of variability and several studies have found such associations with a sustained attention task. Here, we expand our knowledge to include a reflexive attention task. We ask whether specific candidate genes are associated with interindividual variability on a childhood reflexive attention task in 9-16 year olds.

Whereas traditional dance-based games emphasize step movements on a dance pad, more recent dance games emphasize intuitive dance movements using simple controllers or players' own bodies to ""just dance."" However, because of limited space and access, young adults in Taiwan often do not use these games. Popular dance videos on YouTube are more readily available to students because these videos can be accessed on a computer. Therefore, the current study examines the effects of interactivity (the role of feedback) and controller use on participants' physiological and psychological outcomes during exergames. Materials and Methods: The dance game ""Just Dance 3"" (Ubisoft, Montreuil, France) was chosen as the stimulus for this study. Participants danced through one song for rehearsal and warm-up, followed by three songs for the experiment, which lasted approximately 12 minutes. One hundred twenty-nine college students participated in a 2×2×2 (interactivity, feedback versus no feedback; controller, with versus without; sex, male versus female) between-subject factorial design. Results: A series of 2×2×2 (interactivity, controller, and sex) analyses of variance showed no significant differences in interaction effects on participants' heart rates, blood pressures, body movements, step counts, or perceived psychological outcomes.

Meanwhile, increased access to information technology in recent years among seniors has led to the increased applicability of games aiding senior activities that incorporate information technology. In this study, we constructed and assessed a nursing intervention incorporating an actual walking exercise game developed for the use of seniors in order to identify the cognitive, social, and physical impact it has on their health behaviors. Subjects and Method: This quasi-experimental study used a one-group pre-/post-test design in which 15 people 65 years of age or older were selected to participate through a serious health game conducted at the senior welfare center twice a week, for 12 weeks. Besides having their basic physical measurements taken, seniors participated in physical exercise sessions that included educational content. The measured variables were health beliefs and concerns, subjective knowledge, subjective norms, perceived reliability, perceived ease of use and usefulness, perceived behavioral control, attitudes about health behaviors, intentions to perform health behaviors, health behaviors, blood pressure, pulse rate, endurance, agility and balance, and flexibility. Results: Significant increases in health beliefs and concerns, perceived reliability, perceived behavioral control, perceived ease of use, attitudes about health behaviors, and intentions to perform health behaviors were observed at post-test, compared with pre-test data points. These increases were also recorded for physical domains. Significant increases in systolic blood pressure and pulse rates were noted immediately after the intervention, along with increased endurance levels, indicating that the exercise had an effect on participants' health. Conclusions: Ongoing research is required regarding the development and impact of distinctive nursing interventions, conducted through various forms of serious health games relatively easy to use, by integrating various motivating factors for engaging in health behaviors and the entertainment value of such games. © Copyright 2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2015.",26182061,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84992699523

This paper illustrates how we create agents by employing FALCON, a self-organizing neural network that performs reinforcement learning, to play a well-known first-person shooter computer game called Unreal Tournament. Rewards used for learning are either obtained from the game environment or estimated using the temporal difference learning scheme. In this way, the agents are able to acquire proper strategies and discover the effectiveness of different weapons without any guidance or intervention. The experimental results show that our agents learn effectively and appropriately from scratch while playing the game in real-time.

As we indicate, each model exemplifies different aspects of the bottom of the hill of autonomy as an emergent property of artificial systems specified through three aspects (""Self control"", ""Adaptivity to the environment"" and ""Response to environment""). In summary, our conception is that autonomy, when presented as an emergent characteristic, could fill the important place given it by elaborations in philosophical ethics and one that leads us to a clearer comprehension of where to direct our efforts in the field of artificial agents.

Obesity is not just being overweight. It is a metabolic disorder due to the accumulation of excess dietary calories into visceral fat and the release of high concentrations of free fatty acids into various organs. It represents a state of chronic oxidative stress and low-grade inflammation whose intermediary molecules may include leptin, adiponectin and cytokines. It may progress to hyperglycemia, leading to type 2 diabetes. Whether or not dietary antioxidant supplements are useful in the management of obesity and type 2 diabetes is discussed in this review. Only the benefits for obesity and diabetes are examined here. Other health benefits of antioxidants are not considered. There are difficulties in comparing studies in this field because they differ in the time frame, participants' ethnicity, administration of antioxidant supplements, and even in how obesity was measured. However, the literature presents reasonable evidence for marginal benefits of supplementation with zinc, lipoic acid, carnitine, cinnamon, green tea, and possibly vitamin C plus E, although the evidence is much weaker for omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, coenzyme Q10, green coffee, resveratrol, or lycopene. Overall, antioxidant supplements are not a panacea to compensate for a fast-food and video-game way of living, but antioxidant-rich foods are recommended as part of the lifestyle.

Emotional support can help to decrease or diminish social distress. Such support may play an important role at different points of social interaction. However, it is unclear how the beneficial effects of social support are represented in the brains of socially anxious individuals. To explore this, we used the same paradigm previously used to examine the effects of emotional support on social pain caused by exclusion. Undergraduates (n = 46) showing a wide range of social anxiety scores underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while participating in a Cyberball game. Participants were initially included and later excluded from the game. In the latter half of the session in which participants were excluded, they were provided with supportive messages. In line with our previous work, we found that social exclusion led to increased anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activity, whereas emotional support led to increased left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) activity. Despite validation of the paradigm, social anxiety was not associated with increased ACC activity during social exclusion, or during perceived emotional support. Instead, fear of negative evaluation as assessed by the Brief Fear of Negative Evaluation (BFNE) scale showed positive associations with left DLPFC activation while receiving emotional support, compared to while being socially excluded. The more socially anxious an individual was, the greater was the left DLPFC activity increased during receipt of messages. This suggests that highly socially anxious people still have the ability to perceive social support, but that they are nevertheless susceptible to negative evaluation by others. © 2015 Nishiyama et al.

Existing evidence suggests a possible route for attaining togetherness – interpersonal synchrony, the fine-grained sensory-motor coordination that promotes social connectedness. Here, we investigated the physiological characteristics of togetherness using a practice from theater and dance, the mirror game. Pairs of expert improvisers jointly improvised synchronized linear motion, while their motion tracks and cardiovascular activity were continuously monitored. Players also provided dynamic ratings of togetherness while watching video recordings of their games. We identified periods of togetherness using kinematic and subjective markers and assessed their physiological characteristics. The kinematic and the subjective measures of togetherness showed some agreement, with more extensive game periods being marked by the subjective than the kinematic one. Game rounds with high rates of togetherness were characterized by increased players’ cardiovascular activity, increased correlation of players’ heart rates (HRs), and increased motion intensity. By comparing motion segments with similar motion intensity, we showed that moments of togetherness in the mirror game were marked by increased players’ HRs, regardless of motion intensity. This pattern was robust for the subjectively defined periods of togetherness, while showing a marginal effect for the kinematically defined togetherness. Building upon similar findings in flow research we suggest that the observed increase of players’ HRs during togetherness periods in the mirror game might indicate the enhanced engagement and enjoyment reported by performers going into ‘the zone.’ The suggested approach, combining temporal measurements of kinematic, physiological and subjective responses, demonstrates how the dynamics of spontaneously emerging dyadic states can be studied empirically. © 2015 Noy, Levit-Binunand Golland.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84933677775

Exercise videogames (EVG) may be a practical and attractive alternative to traditional forms of exercise. However there is insufficient research to determine whether EVG play alone is sufficient to produce prolonged engagement in physical activity or improvements in cardiovascular fitness and overall health risk. The goal of the present study is to test the efficacy of exercise videogames to increase time spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and to improve cardiovascular risk indices among adults. Methods: Wii Heart Fitness is a rigorous 3-arm randomized controlled trial with adults comparing three 12-week programs: (1) supervised EVGs, (2) supervised standard exercise, and (3) a control condition. Heart rate is monitored continuously throughout all exercise sessions. Assessments are conducted at baseline, end of intervention (week 12), 6 and 9. months. The primary outcome is time spent in MVPA physical activity. Secondary outcomes include changes in cardiovascular fitness, body composition, blood lipid profiles and maintenance of physical activity through six months post-treatment. Changes in cognitive and affective constructs derived from Self Determination and Social Cognitive Theories will be examined to explain the differential outcomes between the two active treatment conditions. Conclusion: The Wii Heart Fitness study is designed to test whether regular participation in EVGs can be an adequate source of physical activity for adults. This study will produce new data on the effect of EVGs on cardiovascular fitness indices and prolonged engagement with physical activity. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",25896114,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928267223

It is clear that BioShock wants to be taken as a spiritual sequel to Rand's philosophical novel Atlas Shrugged, revealing a possible fate for John Galt's mysterious hidden utopia, sought after for much of the novel but never fully revealed, as the book ends just before Galt discloses his society and its plans for the world.

This research tests and compares the prosocial effects of two of the most prototypical emotions on a range of prosocial intentions and behaviors. Emotion-inducing videos were used to instigate states of moral elevation (felt when witnessing a moral virtue) and/or moral outrage (felt when witnessing a moral transgression). Although elevation and outrage are derived from opposing appraisals, separate strands of research show that they both instigate a desire to help others. The current research tests the appraisal tendency framework to explore whether elevation and outrage increase prosociality across moral domains or whether their prosocial effects are domain specific. Results of Experiment 1 showed that elevation, but not outrage, increased donations to charity (i.e., benevolence domain). Experiment 2 showed that outrage, but not elevation, increased prosocial political action intentions (i.e., justice domain). Experiment 3 showed that outrage, but not elevation, increased compensation in a third-party bystander game (i.e., justice domain).

As autonomous agents, peers cooperate only when they are incentivized to do so. Typically, incentives are provided through bilateral exchange of useful data, in a tit-for-tat manner. Unfortunately, good for file sharing and video-on-demand systems as they are, such incentive schemes are ineffective in live streaming systems due mainly to the lack of sufficient opportunity to allow such reciprocity to happen, as recently demonstrated in a pioneering quantitative study. The key insight is that with stringent time constraint, good system performance can only be sustained by judicious peer selection. Despite that some pioneering efforts are done in peer selection, it is as yet a difficult challenge to tackle the inherent non-cooperation of peers in a dynamic and bandwidth-diverse network. In this paper, we meet this challenge by first presenting a novel hierarchical game model, covering strategic interactions among peers, trackers, and the content provider. Based on the analytical insights derived from the repeated game model, we propose a Striker strategy to coerce peers to cooperate, leading to significantly enhanced system performance, as demonstrated by our analytical and simulation results.

Materials and Methods: Simple games using static posturography technology allowed subjects to control screen events via postural sway. Game performance was compared with GMFMs using correlation analysis in a convenience sample of nine girls and six boys with cerebral palsy. Likert scales were used to obtain subjective responses to the balance games. Results: GMFM scores correlated with game performance, especially measures emphasizing rhythmic sway. Twelve of the 15 subjects enjoyed the game and asserted an interest in playing again. Conclusions: Digital posturography games engage children with cerebral palsy in balance tasks, provide visual feedback in a balance control task, and have the potential to increase autonomy in balance control training among pediatric patients with cerebral palsy. This approach can support the relationship between child and therapist. The potential for interactive posturography to complement the assessment and treatment of balance in cerebral palsy bears continuing study. © Copyright 2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",26181808,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84992709467

The reasons include a wide use of technology and a lack of enjoyment while exercising. The purpose of this study was to compare the physiological, perceptual and enjoyment responses between a single bout of (I) conventional cycling and (II) interactive cycling video game at a matched workload. Methods: A cross-sectional study in 34 healthy participants was performed. Initially, participants completed an incremental maximal cycling test to measure peak oxygen uptake and to determine ventilatory threshold. In random order, participants carried out a 30 min interactive cycling trial and a 30 min conventional cycling trial at 55% of peak power output. During the trials, oxygen uptake and energy expenditure were measured by open-circuit spirometry and heart rate was measured by radiotelemetry. RPE and enjoyment were measured every 10 minutes with Borg scale and a modified PACES scale. Results: Interactive cycling resulted in a significantly greater %VO2Reserve (68.2% ± 9.2% vs 64.7% ± 8.1%), rate of energy expenditure (505.8±75.2 vs 487.4±81.2 j·kg-1·min-1), and enjoyment (63.4% ± 17 vs 42% ± 13.6), P<0.05. Participants were working at a higher intensity in relation to the individual's ventilatory threshold during the interactive cycling video game trial (M = 11.86, SE = 3.08) than during the Conventional cycling trial (M = 7.55, SE = 3.16, t(33) = -2.69, P<0.05, r =.42). No significant differences were found for heart rate reserve (72.5 ± 10.4 vs 71.4±10.1%) and RPE (13.1 ± 1.8 vs 13.2 ± 1.7). Conclusion: Interactive cycling games can be a valid alternative to conventional exercise as they result in a higher exercise intensity than conventional cycling and a distraction from aversive cognitive and physiological states at and above the ventilatory threshold. © 2015 Monedero et al.",25738290,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928905825

Methods: Data are from the ROOTS study. MVPA and sedentary time were assessed using combined movement and heart rate sensing. Time spent TV viewing, using the internet, playing video games, doing homework and reading for pleasure was self-reported. Data on objectively-measured and self-reported outcomes for weekdays was available for 738 (age 14.5y, 55.7% female) and 800 (56.3% female) participants, respectively. Adolescents perceived family functioning and friendship quality (Two subscales: 'Good friendship qualities', 'Friendship difficulties') was assessed by questionnaire. Analyses were conducted using multi-level linear or logistic regression. Results: Adolescents reporting better family functioning accumulated more MVPA on weekdays (beta; 95% confidence interval: 0.57; 0.17,0.98). Higher scores on the good friendship qualities subscale was associated with greater MVPA throughout the week (weekdays: 1.13; 0.62,1.65, weekend: 0.56; 0.09,1.02) and lower sedentary time on weekdays (-10.34; -17.03,-3.66). Boys from better functioning families were less likely to report playing video games at the weekend (OR; 95% confidence interval: 0.73; 0.57,0.93) or reading for pleasure (weekday: 0.73; 0.56,0.96 weekend: 0.75; 0.58,0.96). Boys who attained higher scores on the good friendship qualities scale were less likely to play video games at the weekend (0.61; 0.44,0.86) or report high homework on weekdays (0.54; 0.31,0.94). A higher score for good friendship qualities was associated with lower odds of girls playing video games during the week (0.76; 0.58,1.00) or reading for pleasure at the weekend (0.61; 0.42,0.88). Girls that reported fewer friendship difficulties had lower odds of high TV viewing (0.76; 0.62,0.93) or playing video games (0.71; 0.52,0.97) at the weekend, and lower odds of reading for pleasure (0.63; 0.49,0.81) or reporting high homework on weekdays (0.70; 0.52,0.95).

The main objective of this study was to assess the ability of five VR casino cues to elicit subjective reactions and physiological responses that can be used within the CET paradigm. A second objective was to analyze changes in participants' urge to gamble after repeated exposure to a VR casino program and relaxation training. Methods: Twelve recreational gamblers were exposed to five virtual environments with casino-related cues that reproduced typical gambling situations. Self-reported subjective urges and psychophysiological responses were recorded during exposure. Results: All virtual environments with casino-related cues generated craving in recreational gamblers, whereas no increase in the psychophysiological variables was observed. In addition, urges to gamble elicited by VR casino environment reduced through repeated exposure and relaxation training.

In running the show in Los Angeles, Peter Ueberroth prioritised pre-existing facilities, a new and more profitable means of affiliating corporate sponsors with an organising committee, and maximising revenue from television rights negotiations. His success encouraged cities to re-enter the bidding for Olympic festivals, and when combined with initiatives launched by the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) President, Juan Antonio Samaranch, brighter days for the IOC lay ahead in the 1980s and 1990s. Yet, Ueberroth's legacy was not well managed ultimately by Samaranch, who permitted the enhanced competition among bid cities, and the behaviour of bid officials and some of his own members to endanger the IOC's reputation and autonomy, highlighted notably by the Salt Lake City scandal. Last, in light of the cost of the Olympic festivals in Beijing and Sochi, and its dampening effect on the current host city bidding environment, it seems wise for the IOC and future bid cities to re-visit the Ueberroth model for lessons in cost containment, and like Ueberroth, exhibit a willingness to explore novel, more cost-effective means for cities to host the Olympic Games. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84921445115

The effect of playing racing games on the inclination of gamers to take risks has been investigated. Method Two experiments were conducted. In experiment 1, the impact of personality traits on the effects of playing racing games on risk-taking inclination was examined. The Vienna Test System, which includes the Eysenck Personality Profile Test and the Vienna Risk- Taking Test, was used to measure risk-taking inclination and risk-taking while driving. Experiment 2 was designed and conducted to analyse the effects of different intensity levels of car racing games on risk-taking inclination, and to study the relationship between physiological data and risk-taking inclination. Physiological data on skin conductance, heart rate and blood pressure were measured with the NeuroDyne System. Results Participants playing a racing game were more inclined to take risks in critical road traffic situations than those playing a neutral game. The adventurousness dimension of the Eysenck Personality Profile Test correlated significantly positively with risk-taking inclination. More importantly, the effect of the intensity level of a racing game on risk-taking inclination was significant. The higher the intensity level of the racing game, the higher the risk-taking inclination while driving. The effect of intensity level of the racing game on skin conductance was significantly positive. Skin conductance correlated significantly positively with risk-taking inclination. Conclusions The effect of playing racing games on risk-taking inclination is linked to personality and physiological data. Some recommendations are proposed as a result of this study for racing game management. © 2015, BMJ Publishing Group. All right reserved.",25540062,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84937906176

The purpose of the study was to examine physiological predictors of the development of PVGU across adolescence. Methods The article involves a 1-year longitudinal study across midadolescence. Participants were 374 adolescents and their parents from a large metropolitan area in the Northwest United States. PVGU was assessed via questionnaire, as were a number of control variables. A number of physiological indicators including respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and galvanic skin conductance (indices of parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system activity, respectively) were measured during baseline, a cognitively stimulating task (Rubik's cube), and a family problem-solving task. Results Less RSA withdrawal to a cognitively simulating task was related to greater pathologic video game symptoms, but less RSA withdrawal to a family problem-solving task was associated with the presence of pathologic video game symptoms (p <.05). For girls only, galvanic skin conductance activation during the family problem solving was related to greater pathologic video game symptoms (p <.01). Conclusions These findings suggest that adolescents who do not find cognitive tasks stimulating physiologically have a greater severity of PVGU. Additionally, adolescents who show physiological signs of stress in a family task were more likely to have PVGU symptoms and only girls have more severe PVGU levels.

Progress in sensors and algorithms for off-the-shelf EEG systems has made it possible for gaming researchers to perform real-time estimation of human cognitive and affective states using EEG. In this study our aim was to coordinate “Task Engagement” data with “Arousal-Valence” data. The resulting coordinate was designed for application to expressive transformations to video game play in real time by tuning different performance parameters in an Engagement-Arousal rule system. Results revealed that the engagement index (Beta / (Alpha + Theta)) was capable of differentiating high intensity game events (Player Death) from general game play. Given that higher levels of engagement during death events may reflect increase in autonomic response, we also measured arousal by using (BetaF3 + BetaF4) / (AlphaF3 + AlphaF4) and valence using (AlphaF4 / BetaF4) - (AlphaF3 / BetaF3). Results revealed that arousal increases and valence decreases during high intensity game events (Player Death) when compared to lower intensity game events (General Game Play). Given our desire to establish “Task Engagement” data with “Arousal-Valence” coordinates for a flow model, we divided the data into quartiles, which allowed us to establish upper and lower thresholds to indicate when the player has left a state of flow. Our aim was to use an off-the-shelf EEG system to establish “Task Engagement” and “Arousal-Valence” coordinates during video game play that can be used for a flow model.

Active video game studies have focused principally on the metabolic consumption of a single player, with physiological and psychological responses of opponent-based multiplayer games to be further evaluated. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether adding a competitive component to playing active video games impacts physiological and psychological responses in players. METHODS: Sixty-two healthy Caucasian children and adolescents, nine to 14 years years of age, completed three conditions (8 min each) in random order: treadmill walking, and single and opponent-based Kinect active video games. Affect, arousal, rate of perceived exertion, heart rate and percentage of heart rate reserve were measured for each participant and condition. RESULTS: Kinect conditions revealed significantly higher heart rate, percentage of heart rate reserve, rate of perceived exertion and arousal when compared with treadmill walking (P≤0.001). Opponent-based condition revealed lower values for the rate of perceived exertion (P=0.02) and higher affect (P=0.022) when compared with single play. CONCLUSION: Competitive active video games improved children's psychological responses (affect and rate of perceived exertion) compared with single play, providing a solution that may contribute toward improved adherence to physical activity. © 2015 Pulsus Group Inc.

Differences in both may be explained by differences in experienced positive or negative arousal. This study utilizes the limited capacity model of motivated mediated message processing (LC4MP) and the motivation activation measure (MAM), which measures resting activation of the appetitive and aversive arousal systems, to explore the relationship between attraction to media violence, arousal, and aggression. In part 1, a questionnaire found that men and frequent players of violent games expected to enjoy violent games more than nonviolent games. In addition, participants whose scores on the MAM characterized them as risk takers (high scores on appetitive arousal and low scores on aversive arousal) indicated a stronger preference for violent games compared to the other three arousal types, which is in line with the LC4MP. In the experimental portion of the research, after playing a violent game, those participants characterized as risk avoidant (high on aversive arousal and low on appetitive arousal) were significantly less aggressive than all other arousal groups. Overall, results show that individual differences in the appetitive and aversive arousal systems can explain attraction to violent media. Furthermore, arousal resulting from violent video game play can be experienced as pleasant or aversive, and it is this experience of arousal that explains variations in aggressive responses to violent video games. © Taylor & Francis.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84945453738

Method. An anonymous and voluntary questionnaire was completed during class hours by 7,757 Swedish adolescents aged 13-18 years. The questionnaire included demographic background, gaming habits, and depressive, musculoskeletal, and psychosomatic symptoms. Results. It was found that increased online gaming time during weekdays increased the probability of having depressive, musculoskeletal, and psychosomatic symptoms. However, these relations with time spent gaming were further explained by online gaming motives. Weekday online gaming for more than five hours a day, in combination with escape motives, was associated with an increased probability of depressive symptoms (odds ratio (OR) 4.614, 95% CI 3.230-6.590), musculoskeletal symptoms (OR 2.494, 95% CI 1.598-3.892), and psychosomatic symptoms (OR 4.437, 95% CI 2.966-6.637). The probability of ill health decreased when gaming was for fun or had social motives. Conclusion. Excessive gaming time and escape motives were found to be associated with increased probability of ill health among adolescents. Gaming motives may identify gamers in need of support to reduce unhealthy gaming behaviour as well as identify individuals at risk for ill health. © 2015 © Informa Healthcare.",26072677,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84945115254

OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine the cardiovascular and metabolic responses, changes in flexibility and exercise adherence to an aerobic dance exercise programme using the XBOX Kinect over a 6 week training period. METHODS: Training was conducted using the Just Dance 4 disc on the XBOX Kinect 360. Participants attended five, 30 minute sessions per week for the first two weeks, four 45 minute sessions per week for the next two weeks and three 60 minute sessions per week for the last two weeks. Outcomes assessed included flexibility, body mass index (BMI), percentage body fat, maximal oxygen consumption (VO<inf>2max</inf>), resting and post exercise blood pressure, heart rate and blood lactate levels. RESULTS: There were significant improvements in flexibility, maximal oxygen consumption and resting heart rate. There were no significant changes in BMI, percentage body fat or blood lactate levels. Nine (37.5%) participants continued to engage in this form of exercise at least 3-days per week over the 3-month post intervention follow-up period.

To do this, we used hermeneutic analytical methods and grounded theory methodology to analyze 125 hours of recording from 42 biographical interviews, 23 of them with long-term follow-up. Participants were addicted (ex-) gamers according to screening instruments, aged 16 to 44, 29 males and 13 females.The integrated (dys-) functionality model shows in-game behavior of participants to be dysfunctional in that it hinders advancement in several distinguishable real-life biographical quests (for success, for belonging, and for autonomy) and at the same time functional in that it matches these quests. The model integrates two seemingly irreconcilable research traditions: The addiction/disease model in medical-psychological research investigates dysfunctionality of gaming in pathological gamers. Game studies focus on functionality of in-game behavior and establish gamer typologies based on gaming motives. By adding the biographical context to game studies, but keeping the gamer's perspective, we show that gamers whose lives become dominated by gaming may know what they want and “virtually” get it, but still not “really” get it in the long term. “Compensatory” gaming does not, thus, equal unproblematic or “non-addicted” gaming. © 2015, Inst. fur Klinische Psychologie und Gemeindepsychologie.

Nonetheless, the underlying characteristics of these stressors and the study in which the stressor was applied are generally not recognized for their moderating effect on the measured physiological stress responses. We have therefore conducted a meta-analysis that analyzes the effects of characteristics of digital game stressors and study design on heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, in studies carried out from 1976 to 2012. In order to assess the differing quality between study designs, a new scale is developed and presented, coined reliability of effect size. The results show specific and consistent moderating functions of both game and study characteristics, on average accounting for around 43%, and in certain cases up to 57% of the variance found in physiological stress responses. Possible cognitive and physiological processes underlying these moderating functions are discussed, and a new model integrating these processes with the moderating functions is presented. These findings indicate that a digital game stressor does not act as a stressor by virtue of being a game, but rather derives its stressor function from its characteristics and the methodology in which it is used. This finding, together with the size of the associated moderations, indicates the need for a standardization of digital game stressors. © 2015 Society for Psychophysiological Research.",25950613,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84949107262

Previous findings from neuroscientific research indicate an enhanced motivational attention toward cues related to computer games, similar to findings in substance-related addictions. On the other hand in clinical observational studies tolerance effects are reported by patients with Internet Gaming disorder. In the present study we investigated whether an enhanced motivational attention or tolerance effects are present in patients with Internet Gaming Disorder. Methods: A clinical sample from the Outpatient Clinic for Behavioral Addictions in Mainz, Germany was recruited, fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for Internet Gaming Disorder. In a semi-natural EEG design participants played a computer game during the recording of event-related potentials to assess reward processing. Results: The results indicated an attenuated P300 for patients with Internet Gaming Disorder in response to rewards in comparison to healthy controls, while the latency of N100 was prolonged and the amplitude of N100 was increased. Conclusions: Our findings support the hypothesis that tolerance effects are present in patients with Internet Gaming Disorder, when actively playing computer games. In addition, the initial orienting toward the gaming reward is suggested to consume more capacity for patients with Internet Gaming Disorder, which has been similarly reported by other studies with other methodological background in disorders of substance-related addictions. © 2014 The Authors.

There is little research on such a relationship in adult samples. The aim of the current study was to investigate the association of video game volume with sleep quality in adults via face-to-face interviews using standardized questionnaires. Adults (n = 844, 56.2% women), aged 18-94 years old, participated in the study. Sleep quality was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and gaming volume was assessed by asking the hours of gaming on a regular weekday (Mon-Thurs), Friday and weekend day (Sat-Sun). Adjusting for gender, age, educational level, exercise and perceived stress, results of hierarchical regression analyses indicated that video gaming volume was a significant predictor of sleep quality (β = 0.145), fatigue (β = 0.109), insomnia (β = 0.120), bedtime (β = 0.100) and rise time (β = 0.168). Each additional hour of video gaming per day delayed bedtime by 6.9 min (95% confidence interval 2.0-11.9 min) and rise time by 13.8 min (95% confidence interval 7.8-19.7 min). Attributable risk for having poor sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index > 5) due to gaming >1 h day was 30%. When examining the components of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index using multinomial regression analysis (odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals), gaming volume significantly predicted sleep latency, sleep efficiency and use of sleep medication. In general, findings support the conclusion that gaming volume is negatively related to the overall sleep quality of adults, which might be due to underlying mechanisms of screen exposure and arousal. © 2014 European Sleep Research Society.",25358428,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84923768176

Thus, the early detection of dysfunctional ER strategies and training in adaptive ER strategies can help prevent future occurrences of possible behavioral and psychosocial disorders.

This paper examines the potential of combining multiple modalities for detecting affective responses of patients interacting with a simulation built on game technology, aimed at the treatment of mental diagnoses such as post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). For that purpose, we couple game design and game technology to create a game-based tool for exposure therapy and stress inoculation training that utilizes stress detection for the automatic profiling and potential personalization of PTSD treatments. The PTSD treatment game we designed forces the player to go through various stressful experiences while a stress detection mechanism profiles the severity and type of PTSD by analyzing the physiological responses to those in-game stress elicitors in two separate modalities: skin conductance (SC) and blood volume pulse (BVP). SC is often used to monitor stress as it is connected to the activation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). By including BVP into the model we introduce information about para-sympathetic activation, which offers a more complete view of the psycho-physiological experience of the player; in addition, as BVP is also modulated by SNS, a multimodal model should be more robust to changes in each modality due to particular drugs or day-to-day bodily changes. Overall, the study and analysis of 14 PTSD-diagnosed veteran soldiers presented in this paper reveals correspondence between diagnostic standard measures of PTSD severity and SC and BVP responsiveness and feature combinations thereof. The study also reveals that these features are significantly correlated with subjective evaluations of the stressfulness of experiences, represented as pairwise preferences. More importantly, the results presented here demonstrate that using the modalities of SC and BVP captures a more nuanced representation of player stress responses than using SC alone. We conclude that the results support the use of the simulation as a relevant treatment tool for stress inoculation training, and suggest the feasibility of using such a tool to profile PTSD patients. The use of multiple modalities appears to be key for an accurate profiling, although further research and analysis are required to identify the most relevant physiological features for capturing user stress. © 2014, OpenInterface Association.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925289430

This study examined the influence of experience level on activity levels and affect resulting from playing a martial arts IVG. Methods: Twenty participants completed 3 15-minute trials: (1) walking, (2) IVG with no previous experience (INEXP), and (3) IVG activity after 2 hours of practice (EXP) during which heart rate (HR), step counts, metabolic equivalents of task (METs), ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), session RPE, and affect (positive/negative affect, enjoyment) were measured. Results: Mean HR was lower during walking (107 ± 18 bpm) than during INEXP (131 ± 25 bpm) and EXP (120 ± 20 bpm). Peak HR and session RPE were lower for walking than for INEXP and EXP. No difference in mean HR was observed between IVG conditions, but peak HR and session RPE were lower for EXP than for INEXP. Walking resulted in greater postactivity reduction of negative affect; however, the IVG conditions were perceived as more enjoyable.

The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is thought to implement controls that minimize performance disruptions from threat-induced anxiety and goal distraction by modulating activity in regions involved in threat detection, such as the amygdala. The inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and ventromedial PFC (vmPFC) have been linked to the regulation of anxiety during threat exposure. We developed a paradigm to determine if threat-induced anxiety would enhance functional connectivity between the amygdala and IFG, OFC, and vmPFC. METHODS: Healthy adults performed a computer-gaming style task involving capturing prey and evading predators to optimize monetary rewards while exposed to the threat of unpredictable shock. Psychophysiological recording (n 5 26) and functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning (n 5 17) were collected during the task in separate cohorts. Task-specific changes in functional connectivity with the amygdala were examined using psychophysiological interaction analysis. RESULTS: Threat exposure resulted in greater arousal measured by increased skin conductance but did not influence performance (i.e., monetary losses or rewards). Greater functional connectivity between the right amygdala and bilateral IFG, OFC, vmPFC, anterior cingulate cortex, and frontopolar cortex was associated with threat exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to unpredictable threat modulates amygdala-PFC functional connectivity that may help maintain performance when experiencing anxiety induced by threat.

The aim of this study was to determine whether high blood pressure (HBP) is associated with sedentary behavior in young people even after controlling for potential confounders (gender, age, socioeconomic level, tobacco, alcohol, obesity and physical activity). Methods. In this epidemiological study, 1231 adolescents were evaluated. Blood pressure was measured with an oscillometric device and waist circumference with an inextensible tape. Sedentary behavior (watching television, computer use and playing video games) and physical activity were assessed by a questionnaire. We used mean and standard deviation to describe the statistical analysis, and the association between HBP and sedentary behavior was assessed by the chi-squared test. Binary logistic regression was used to observe the magnitude of association and cluster analyses (sedentary behavior and abdominal obesity; sedentary behavior and physical inactivity). Results.

He is treated accordingly, i.e., as having both extrinsic and intrinsic representations in public fictions. Even more, a popular (mis)construal of Theology is part of the aesthetic tradition that games are bound to fall into. The fictionalizing of the daily life in the gaming industry essentially relies on sensational incidents and violent appeals to emotions. The cultural discourse of game-playing brings together the visual and the sonic set-up of godly absence/presence plain to see in the familiar re-enactment of the social intercourse and in the re-construction of a mostly urban landscape. Basically, the computer generated interface is immersive insofar as it features ethically-minded versus morally-corrupt characters. The video games aesthetics showcases a version of the Western pop culture that fits the obviously monotheist mould of our European past. What drives the usually minimal plot of mainstream digital storytelling is the compulsive belief in one legitimizing truth. The underlying cultural narrative is that of one hero, who embodies statistics about biography and sets out to enforce his authority over the world. The search for existential answers to questions of life purpose is limited to the presuppositions of the Western civilisation. The conclusion is that a melodramatic paradigm structures the ethical and societal issues touched upon by current mainstream video games. © 2015, European Journal of Science and Theology.

One of the most prevalent chronic diseases that affect Americans is hypertension (HTN). Despite the known comorbidities and increased mortality rate associated with uncontrolled HTN, most community dwelling adults with HTN do not have sufficient blood pressure control. Therefore, the aim of this article is to report the preliminary efficacy of a serious game for health to enhance blood pressure control among community dwelling adults with HTN. A nonprobability sample of 116 community dwelling adults with HTN participated in this nonblinded, randomized controlled trial. Participants were randomly assigned to: (1) an intervention arm that consisted of four exposures to a serious game for health known as eSMART-HD; or (2) an attentional control arm that compromised of four exposures to screen-based HTN education. The primary outcome measure for this trial was blood pressure reduction over a four month observational period. In this study, baseline characteristics and blood pressure measurements were similar between participants in each study arm. There was no significant between-group difference in blood pressure reduction over time. However, there were significant within-group reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressures across time among favoring participants exposed to eSMART-HD. This study establishes the preliminary efficacy of eSMART-HD that can be easily administered to community dwelling adults and facilitate clinically significant reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Future studies should assess the influential components of this promising serious game for health (eSMART-HD) combined with medication management in larger and more diverse samples of community dwelling adults with HTN. © 2015, Southern Public Administration Education Foundation, Inc.

This pilot randomized trial was conducted to explore the potential of theory-guided active video games in increasing moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) among young adults. Method: In this pilot 4-week intervention, participants were randomly assigned to 1 of the following groups: an AVG group with all the self determination theory (SDT)-based game features turned off, an AVG group with all the SDT-based game features turned on, a passive gameplay group with all the SDT-based game features turned on, and a control group. Physical activity was measured using ActiGraph GT3X accelerometers. Other outcomes included attendance and perceived need satisfaction of autonomy, competence and relatedness. Results: It was found that playing the self-determination theory supported AVG resulted in greater MVPA compared with the control group immediately postintervention. The AVG with the theory-supported features also resulted in greater attendance and psychological need satisfaction than the non-theory-supported one. Conclusion: An AVG designed with motivation theory informed features positively impacted attendance and MVPA immediately postintervention, suggesting that including AVG features guided with motivation theory may be a method of addressing common problems with adherence and increasing effectiveness of active gaming. © 2015 American Psychological Association.",26651464,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84979846398

Background: Advances in autonomy have enabled a future vision of single-operator control of multiple heterogeneous UVs. Real-time scheduling for multiple UVs in uncertain environments requires the computational ability of optimization algorithms combined with the judgment and adaptability of human supervisors. Because of system and environmental uncertainty, appropriate operator trust will be instrumental to maintain high system performance and prevent cognitive overload. Method: Three groups of operators experienced different levels of trust priming prior to conducting simulated missions in an existing, multiple-UV simulation environment. Results: Participants who play computer and video games frequently were found to have a higher propensity to overtrust automation. By priming gamers to lower their initial trust to a more appropriate level, system performance was improved by 10% as compared to gamers who were primed to have higher trust in the automation. Conclusion: Priming was successful at adjusting the operator's initial and dynamic trust in the automated scheduling algorithm, which had a substantial impact on system performance. Application: These results have important implications for personnel selection and training for futuristic multi-UV systems under human supervision. Although gamers may bring valuable skills, they may also be potentially prone to automation bias. Priming during training and regular priming throughout missions may be one potential method for overcoming this propensity to overtrust automation. © Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.",26060238,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84944340164

In the present study, possible effects of the game Fifa 2015 on cognitive performance, hormonal levels, and electroencephalographic (EEG) signals were evaluated in young male volunteers. Methods: Thirty two subjects aged 20 years on average participated mutually in playing computer game Fifa 2015. Identification information and general knowledge about the game were collected. Saliva samples from the contestants were obtained before and after the competition. Perceptive and cognitive performance including the general cognitive health, response delay, attention maintenance, and mental fatigue were measured using PASAT test. EEG were recorded during the play using EEG device and analyzed later using QEEG. Simultaneously, the players' behavior were recorded using a video camera. Saliva cortisol levels were assessed by ELISA kit. Data were analyzed by SPSS program. Results: The impact of playing computer games on cortisol concentration of saliva before and after the game showed that the amount of saliva plasma after playing the game has dropped significantly. Also the impact of playing computer games on mental health, before and after the game indicated that the number of correct answers has not changed significantly. This indicates that sustained attention has increased in participants after the game in comparison with before that. Also it is shown that mental fatigue measured by PASAT test, did not changed significantly after the game in comparison to before that. The impact of game on changes in brain waves showed that the subjects in high activity state during playing the game had higher power of the EEG signals in most of the channels in lower frequency bands in compared to normal state. Discussion: The present study showed that computer games can positively affect the stress system and the perceptual-cognitive system. Even though this impact was not significant in most cases, the changes in cognitive and hormonal test and also in brain waves were visible. Hence, due to the importance of this matter, it is necessary to create control systems in selecting the types of games for playing.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84937216083

A series of research hypotheses concerning the interaction effects of viewing environment, event – sponsor congruence and arousal intensity were developed. Design/methodology/approach – To test the effect of the viewing environment, a feld experiment was conducted where 44 ice hockey fans attended a professional ice hockey game in the local team’s arena, whereas 44 others saw the same game, at the same time, on television. The participants were randomly assigned to one of the two game viewing conditions. Findings – A higher level of arousal was detrimental to sponsor identifcation in a manner consistent with the intensity of the processing principle according to which arousal polarizes attention resources on the arousing stimulus (the event) while diverting resources away from the peripheral stimuli (the sponsors). In addition, because the event congruent sponsors are more superfcially processed in comparison with the incongruent ones, this negative impact was more pronounced in the former group. This was qualifed by a three-way interaction with the type of environment; the on-site, direct, audience was less affected by the processing intensity principle and exhibited better recall and recognition than the television audience as arousal and congruency increased, whereas, at lower levels of arousal, higher event – sponsor congruence hampered on-site sponsor identifcation in comparison with television. Research limitations/implications – The fndings were obtained in the context of a single sports event; additional studies need to be conducted using different sports. In addition, the comparison of on-site audience with other types of media audiences (e.g. on-line broadcasting) is warranted. Practical implications – Arousal intensity results from the game’s drama, which is a function of game importance and game outcome uncertainty. Hence, except for low-stakes games (e.g. pre-season matches, exhibitions), initiatives that promote a leveled playing feld such as salary cap, fnancial fair play and open leagues are likely to jeopardize sponsor identifcation, particularly for congruent sponsors. With respect to the impact of the viewing environment, congruent sponsors should reap superior benefts from the television audience when the stakes are low. However, when the stakes are high, their benefts will accrue to a greater extent from on-site spectators. Originality/value – This is the frst study to offer a rigorous comparison of sponsorship’s impact on direct (on-site) versus indirect (television) audiences through a feld experiment. This is also the frst research to provide a framework based on the processing intensity principle that encompasses predictions related to arousal and its interaction with event – sponsor congruence and the viewing © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928226557

We predicted that reconsolidation of a reactivated visual memory of experimental trauma could be disrupted by engaging in a visuospatial task that would compete for visual working memory resources. We showed that intrusive memories were virtually abolished by playing the computer game Tetris following a memory-reactivation task 24 hr after initial exposure to experimental trauma. Furthermore, both memory reactivation and playing Tetris were required to reduce subsequent intrusions (Experiment 2), consistent with reconsolidation-update mechanisms.

However, the consistency of the existing literature has not been evaluated. Evidence acquisition: In 2013, the authors conducted a PubMed and Web of Science review of peer-reviewed articles published prior to August 2013 on the relation between violence exposure, experienced in either childhood or adulthood, and cardiovascular outcomes. To meet inclusion criteria, articles had to present estimates for the relation between violence exposure and cardiovascular outcomes (e.g., hypertension, blood pressure, stroke, coronary disease, or myocardial infarction) adjusted for demographic factors. Articles focusing on violence from television, video games, natural disasters, terrorism, or war were excluded. Evidence synthesis: The initial search yielded 2,273 articles; after removing duplicates and applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 30 articles were selected for review. A consistent positive relation was noted on the association between violence experienced during childhood and cardiovascular outcomes in adulthood (i.e., hypertension, coronary heart disease, and myocardial infarction). Associations across genders with varying types of violence exposure were also noted. By contrast, findings were mixed on the relation between adult violence exposure and cardiovascular outcome. Conclusions: Despite varying definitions of violence exposure and cardiovascular endpoints, a consistent relation exists between childhood violence exposure, largely assessed retrospectively, and cardiovascular endpoints. Findings are mixed for the adult violence - cardiovascular health relation.

Departing from that debate, I argue that it is productive to see video games as a composite form supporting different frames for involvement. Against this backdrop the article reports an interview study with game developers, asking what it means to author stories for a composite form. The main results show that the developers do not see storytelling as the defining trait of video games, but as a component in a whole product. The developers display a specific gaze for how players shift their attention between frames. An important skill for the developers is to try to control these shifts in order to enforce the emotions they want the player to have. This specific skill is labelled framework orchestration.

Data were extracted to conduct comparisons for outcome measures in three separate categories: AVGs and sedentary behaviours, AVGs and laboratory-based exercise, and AVGs and field-based physical activity. Effect size for each entry was calculated with the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software in 2015. Mean effect size (Hedge's g) and standard deviation were calculated for each comparison. Compared with sedentary behaviours, AVGs had a large effect on health outcomes. The effect sizes for physiological outcomes were marginal when comparing AVGs with laboratory-based exercises. The comparison between AVGs and field-based physical activity had null to moderate effect sizes. AVGs could yield equivalent health benefits to children/adolescents as laboratory-based exercise or field-based physical activity. Therefore, AVGs can be a good alternative for sedentary behaviour and addition to traditional physical activity and sports in children/adolescents. © 2015 World Obesity.",25943852,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84938742778

Serious games have demonstrated positive effects on adolescent eating and physical activity. The purpose of this paper is to describe how constructs from social cognitive theory (SCT) and self-determination theory (SDT) were operationalized in the development of the serious game CREATURE 101 (C-101) to engage players in acquiring motivation, knowledge, skills, and personal agency. Approach. C-101 was developed from an evaluated nutrition and science curriculum for middle school youth, Choice, Control & Change (C3). Its behavior change goals are three pairs of “increase/decrease” behaviors: increase water / decease sweetened beverages, increase fruit and vegetables / decrease processed snacks (chips, candy etc), and increase physical activity (light, medium, intense) / decrease recreational screen time (watching TV, playing video games for fun) through a “virtual companion care” motif where the players bring their adopted creatures back to health. increase water / decease sweetened beverages, increase fruit and vegetables / decrease processed snacks (chips, candy etc), and increase physical activity (light, medium, intense) / decrease recreational screen time (watching TV, playing video games for fun) through a “virtual companion care” motif where the players bring their adopted creatures back to health. Several procedures or strategies were used to develop the story line and activities in C-101 to address autonomy, competence and relatedness from SDT and outcome expectations, self-efficacy, and behavioral capability from SCT, constructs shown in previous studies as likely to enhance effectiveness of nutrition and physical activity interventions. Implications. This description of how the theory constructs and procedures were used to create an entertaining serious game based on an existing evaluated health-related curriculum can help game developers, curriculum developers, and educators who wish to expand existing curricula through the development and integration of games into their work. © 2015, © 2015 SAGE Publications.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84940663495

Despite their enormous potential, they are currently mostly used only to monitor single individuals. Indeed, BSNs can proactively interact and collaborate to foster novel BSN applications centered on collaborative groups of individuals. In this paper, C-SPINE, a framework for Collaborative BSNs (CBSNs), is proposed. CBSNs are BSNs able to collaborate with each other to fulfill a common goal. They can support the development of novel smart wearable systems for cyberphysical pervasive computing environments. Collaboration therefore relies on interaction and synchronization among the CBSNs and on collaborative distributed computing atop the collaborating CBSNs. Specifically, collaboration is triggered upon CBSN proximity and relies on service-specific protocols allowing for managing services among the collaborating CBSNs. C-SPINE also natively supports multi-sensor data fusion among CBSNs to enable joint data analysis such as filtering, time-dependent data integration and classification. To demonstrate its effectiveness, C-SPINE is used to implement e-Shake, a collaborative CBSN system for the detection of emotions. The system is based on a multi-sensor data fusion schema to perform automatic detection of handshakes between two individuals and capture of possible heart-rate-based emotion reactions due to the individuals' meeting. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A human body is controlled by Brain-Signals, which considered as a main controller. Furthermore, the human emotions and thoughts will be translated by brain through brain signals and expressed as human mood. This controlling process mainly performed through brain signals, the brain signals is a key component in electroencephalogram (EEG). Based on signal processing the features representing human mood (behavior) could be extracted with emotion as a major feature. This paper proposes a new framework in order to recognize the human inner emotions that have been conducted on the basis of EEG signals using a BCI device controller. This framework go through five steps starting by classifying the brain signal after reading it in order to obtain the emotion, then map the emotion, synchronize the animation of the 3D virtual human, test and evaluate the work. Based on our best knowledge there is no framework for controlling the 3D virtual human.

Over the years, strong empirical evidence has emerged, showing that math anxiety has a significant negative effect on mathematics performance. Interestingly enough, some researchers have shown that math anxiety can be trained and reduced. However, the proposed interventions have mostly focused on teachers as oppose to students, while the existing physiological approaches like cognitive behavioural therapy require administration by trained professionals. With recent advancements in technology, low cost commercial brain-computer interface (BCI) devices that can capture human emotions in real time have been developed and can have a potential use in training and reducing math anxiety. In this study, the objective was to determine if using a BCI mathematics educational game can help students to effectively reduce math anxiety. To attain this objective, a within-subjects longitudinal research design with eight data gathering waves was adopted as the primary methodology to ascertain changes in the participant's level of math anxiety across two sessions that took place on separate days. Analysis of data captured across two training sessions with a BCI mathematics educational game showed that math anxiety can be effectively trained and reduced with a BCI. In addition, the results showed that math anxiety has a significant negative impact on mathematics performance which is congruent with prior studies.

Method: BrightBrainer cognitive rehabilitation simulations were first played uni-manually, then bimanually. Participants sat in front of a laptop and interacted through a game controller that measured hand movements in 3D, as well as flexion of both index fingers. Interactive serious games were designed to improve basic and complex attention (concentration, short-term memory, dual tasking), memory recall, executive functioning and emotional well-being. Individual simulations adapted automatically to each participant's level of motor functioning. The system underwent feasibility trials spanning 16 sessions over 8 weeks. Participants were evaluated pre- and post-intervention, using standardized neuropsychological measures. Computerized measures of movement repetitions and task performance were stored on a remote server. Results: Group analysis for 10 participants showed statistically significant improvement in decision making (p<0.01), with trend improvements in depression (p<0.056). Improvements were also seen in processing speed (p<0.13) and auditory attention (p<0.17); however, these were not statistically significant (partly attributable to the modest sample size). Eight of nine neuropsychological tests showed changes in the improvement direction indicating an effective rehabilitation (p<0.01). BrightBrainer technology was well tolerated with mean satisfaction ratings of 4.9/5.0 across participants. Conclusions: Preliminary findings demonstrate utility within an advanced dementia population, suggesting that it will be beneficial to evaluate BrightBrainer through controlled clinical trials and to investigate its application in other clinical populations.Implications for RehabilitationIt is possible to improve cognitive function in older low-functioning patients. Integrative rehabilitation through games combining cognitive (memory, focusing, executive function) and physical (bimanual whole arm movement, grasping, task sequencing) elements is enjoyable for this population.The severity of depression in these elderly can be reduced through virtual reality bimanual games.The number of upper extremity active repetitions performed in the process of solving cognitive problems with the BrightBrainer™ system is 600. This number is 18 times (1875%) larger than those observed by other researchers in conventional physical or occupational rehabilitation sessions. © 2014 Informa UK Ltd.",24679074,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84937214662

In this study we present a serious game designed for the purpose of enhancing the ability of children between the ages of 9 and 12 to cope with conflict situations. Inspired by theoretical models of human conflict and experiential learning, we designed a game through which players experience and try to resolve conflict situations themselves in a virtual environment. In our multiplayer game, Village Voices, each child plays the role of a villager and is asked to complete a number of conflict quests that require social interaction and resource management; the game allows anything from very aggressive behaviours (stealing resources and spreading negative rumors) to collaborative play (trading resources). To model conflict intensity in Village Voices and evaluate its ability to elicit strong emotions and conflict, we ran a game user survey in Portugal from 32 children. Data collected include demographic information and conflict profile types, as well as in-game behavioural data and self-reported notions of conflict and affect during play. The analysis presented in this paper shows that there appear to be strong effects between gender, age, conflict resolution strategy type, cultural tendency, reported emotions and perception about the other players, and reported conflict intensity. Indeed, Village Voices serves as an excellent vehicle for teaching conflict resolution as it is able to elicit bounded conflict situations of varying intensities, and, importantly, enables us to further understand conflict dynamics amongst students of this age group and beyond. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,"English",Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-84944214301

It may be achieved using different strategies such as player scenes analyses leading to the detection of playing fields, recognition of superimposed text like player or team names, identification of player faces, detection of lines typical for a given playing field and for a given sports discipline, detection of sports objects specific for a given sports category, and also recognition of player and audience emotions. The sports video indexing usually starts with the automatic temporal segmentation. Unfortunately, it could happen that two or even more consecutive shots of two different sports events, although most frequently of the same sport discipline, are falsely identified as one shot. The strong similarity mainly of color of playing fields does not sometimes allow the detection of a video transition. On the other hand, very short shots of several frames are detected in case of dissolve effects or they are simply false detections. Most often it is due to very dynamic movements of players or a camera during the game, changes in advertising banners on playing fields, as well as due to light flashes. False as well as miss detections diminish the efficacy of the temporal aggregation method applied to video indexing.

Here, we investigated the neural correlates associated with the persistence of positive affect in the real world by conducting two experiments in humans: an fMRI task of reward responses and an experience-sampling task measuring emotional responses to a reward obtained in the field. The magnitude of DLPFC engagement to rewards administered in the laboratory predicted reactivity of real-world positive emotion following a reward administered in the field. Sustained ventral striatum engagement in the laboratory positively predicted the duration of real-world positive emotional responses. These results suggest that common pathways are associated with the unfolding of neural processes over seconds and with the dynamics of emotions experienced over minutes. Examining such dynamics may facilitate a better understanding of the brain-behavior associations underlying emotion. © 2015, the authors.",26203145,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84937693593

It is also linked to deficits in emotional regulation and frequently co-occurs with anxiety and depression symptoms. There is also evidence that emotional dysregulation may play a mediatory role between GD and psychopathological symptomatology. Few studies have reported the outcomes of psychological interventions that specifically address these underlying processes. Objectives: To assess the utility of the Playmancer platform, a serious video game, as an additional therapy tool in a CBT intervention for GD, and to estimate pre-post changes in measures of impulsivity, anger expression and psychopathological symptomatology. Method: The sample comprised a single group of 16 male treatment-seeking individuals with severe GD diagnosis. Therapy intervention consisted of 16 group weekly CBT sessions and, concurrently, 10 additional weekly sessions of a serious video game. Pre-post treatment scores on South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS), Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11), I7 Impulsiveness Questionnaire (I7), State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory 2 (STAXI-2), Symptom Checklist-Revised (SCL-90-R), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S-T), and Novelty Seeking from the Temperament and Character Inventory-Revised (TCI-R) were compared. Results: After the intervention, significant changes were observed in several measures of impulsivity, anger expression and other psychopathological symptoms. Dropout and relapse rates during treatment were similar to those described in the literature for CBT. Conclusion: Complementing CBT interventions for GD with a specific therapy approach like a serious video game might be helpful in addressing certain underlying factors which are usually difficult to change, including impulsivity and anger expression. © 2015 Tárrega, Castro-Carreras, Fernández-Aranda, Granero, Giner-Bartolomé, Aymamí, Gómez-Peña, Santamaría, Forcano, Steward, Menchón and Jiménez-Murcia.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84949679530

Initial neuropsychological and eye-movement investigations indicated that EM had profound difficulties in face perception as well as face recognition. EM underwent 14weeks of perceptual training in an online programme that attempted to improve her ability to make fine-grained discriminations between faces. Following training, EM's face perception skills had improved, and the effect generalised to untrained faces. Eye-movement analyses also indicated that EM spent more time viewing the inner facial features post-training. Examination of EM's face recognition skills revealed an improvement in her recognition of personally-known faces when presented in a laboratory-based test, although the same gains were not noted in her everyday experiences with these faces. In addition, EM did not improve on a test assessing the recognition of newly encoded faces. One month after training, EM had maintained the improvement on the eye-tracking test, and to a lesser extent, her performance on the familiar faces test. This pattern of findings is interpreted as promising evidence that the programme can improve face perception skills, and with some adjustments, may at least partially improve face recognition skills. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",25369318,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84938988269

Such ‘applications’ were already explored by artists who introduced artistic EEG applications in the early ‘seventies’ of the previous century. These early explorations were not yet supported by advanced signal process methods, simply because there was no computing support possible, and interest in artistic applications faded until it reappeared in more recent years. Research in neuroscience, signal processing, machine learning and applications in medical, assistive BCIs prevailed. It was supported by computer science that provided real-time and off-line processing to analyze and store large amounts of streaming or collected data. With the possibility to access cheap shared and distributed storage and processing power, as it became available in the last decade of the previous century and the first decade of this century, different kinds of BCI applications, following a general interest in digital games, interactive entertainment and social media, became visible. These are domains where experience, fun and emotions are more important than efficiency, robustness and control. BCI provides user and application with a new modality that can be manipulated and interpreted, in addition to other input modalities. This has been explored, but mostly from the point of view of a single user interacting with an application. In this chapter we look at BCI applications where more than one user is involved. Games are among the possible applications and there are already simple games where gamers compete or collaborate using brain signal information from one or more players. We consider extensions of current applications by looking at different types of multi-user games, including massively multi-player online role-playing games. We mention research —distinguishing between active and passive BCI—on multi-participant BCI in non-game contexts that provides us with information about the possibilities of collaborative and competitive multi-brain games and that allows us to develop a vision on such games. The results of the literature study are collected in a tablewhere we distinguish between the various forms of interaction between players (participants) in collaborative and competitive games and team activities. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84921326367

A number of studies have attempted to evaluate media contents, especially TV commercials using various neuroimaging techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG). Yet neurophysiological examination of detailed cognitive and affective responses in viewers is still required to provide practical information to marketers. Here, this study develops a method to analyze temporal patterns of EEG data and extract affective and cognitive indices such as happiness, surprise, and attention for TV commercial evaluation.METHODS: Twenty participants participated in the study. We developed the neurophysiological indices for TV commercial evaluation using classification model. Specifically, these model-based indices were customized using individual EEG features. We used a video game for developing the index of attention and four video clips for developing indices of happiness and surprise. Statistical processes including one-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) and the cross validation scheme were used to select EEG features for each index. The EEG features were composed of the combinations of spectral power at selected channels from the cross validation for each individual. The Fisher's linear discriminant classifier (FLDA) was used to estimate each neurophysiological index during viewing four different TV commercials. Post hoc behavioral responses of preference, short-term memory, and recall were measured.RESULTS: Behavioral results showed significant differences for all preference, short-term memory rates, and recall rates between commercials, leading to a 'high-ranked' commercial group and a 'low-ranked' group (P < 0.05). Neural estimation of happiness results revealed a significant difference between the high-ranked and the low-ranked commercials in happiness index (P < 0.01). The order of rankings based on happiness and attention matched well with the order of behavioral response rankings. In the elapsed-time analysis of the highest-ranked commercial, we could point to visual and auditory semantic structures of the commercial that induced increases in the happiness index.CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that the neurophysiological indices developed in this study may provide a useful tool for evaluating TV commercials.",25906845,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85003321451

This study directly compared how learning to embody an action impacts the neural response when watching and aesthetically evaluating the same action. Twenty-two participants trained for 4 days on dance sequences. Each day they physically rehearsed one set of sequences, passively watched a second set, listened to the music of a third set, and a fourth set remained untrained. Functional MRI was obtained prior to and immediately following the training period, as were affective and physical ability ratings for each dance sequence. This approach enabled precise comparison of self-report methods of embodiment with nonbiased, empirical measures of action performance. Results suggest that after experience, participants most enjoy watching those dance sequences they danced or observed.

The most frequently used approaches were developed for adults and fail to acknowledge the importance of imaginary experiences and the notion of play that may appeal to children. The scope of this article is to introduce a new design-oriented method of gathering information about the emotional state of pediatric patients using an experimental computer game called the Child Patient game (CPgame). The CPgame was developed at a Danish hospital, and the results of the preliminary tests show that games could serve as a system in which children are willing to express their emotions through play. The results are based on two comparative analyses of the CPgame through which it is possible to identify three different types of players among the patients playing the game. Furthermore, the data reveal that pediatric patients display a radically different play pattern than children who are not in hospital. The inquiry takes an interdisciplinary approach; it has obvious health care-related objectives and seeks to meet the urgent need for new methods within health care to optimize communication with young children. At the same time, design research (i.e., the development of new knowledge through the development of a new design) heavily impacts the method. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",25372348,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84943582906

Many investigators have hypothesized that euthymic people with bipolar disorder might display elevated emotional reactivity, but laboratory studies of emotional reactivity have had mixed results. Drawing on theories of bipolar disorder that emphasize dysregulation of goal pursuit, we hypothesized that people with bipolar disorder might be emotionally hyperreactive to frustration of goal pursuit. Forty-seven euthymic participants with bipolar disorder and 43 control participants played a computer game for a monetary reward. To induce frustration, we programmed the game to respond inconsistently to user input during two periods. The frustration induction was successful as measured by self-report, physiological responding, and facial behavior, but contrary to the hypothesis of emotional hyperreactivity in bipolar disorder, the bipolar and control groups were equally reactive to frustration.

Methods: The subject was a 51-year-old Caucasian male diagnosed with PPA who had attended an Adult Day Program for 18 months prior to BrightBrainer training. The subject interacted with therapeutic games using a controller that measured 3D hand movements and flexion of both index fingers. The computer simulations adapted difficulty level based on task performance; results were stored on a remote server. The clinical trial consisted of 16 sessions, twice/week for 8 weeks. The subject was evaluated through neuropsychological measures, therapy notes and caregiver feedback forms. Results: Neuropsychological testing indicated no depression (BDI 0) and severe dementia (BIMS 1 and MMSE 3). The 6.5 h of therapy consisted of games targeting Language comprehension; Executive functions; Focusing; Short-term memory; and Immediate/working memory. The subject attained the highest difficulty level in all-but-one game, while averaging 1300-arm task-oriented active movement repetitions and 320 index finger flexion movements per session. While neuropsychological testing showed no benefits, the caregiver reported strong improvements in verbal responses, vocabulary use, speaking in complete sentences, following one-step directions and participating in daily activities. This corroborated well with therapy notes. Conclusions: Preliminary findings demonstrate a meaningful reduction of PPA symptoms for the subject, suggesting follow-up imaging studies to detail neuronal changes induced by BrightBrainer system and controlled studies with a sufficiently large number of PPA subjects.

Additionally, this study investigated how these two divergent mechanisms influence game enjoyment through immersion-related experiences. The findings showed that the feelings of autonomy and control are consistently stronger explanations for enjoyment, regardless of customization type.

Moreover, people came to evaluate anger less negatively after experiencing anger in a context in which it could be beneficial.

The development is to enable users to safely fly and control the UAV in real time within a limited (yet unconstrained) virtually created environment. Thus, the paper introduces a hardware virtual environment coupling concept, the Panda3D gaming engine utilization to develop the graphical user interface (GUI) and the 3D-flying environment, as well as the interfacing electronics that enables tracking, monitoring and mapping of real-time movement onto the virtual domain and vice verse. Design/methodology/approach The platform comprises a spring-shuttle assembly fixed to a heavy aluminium base. The spring supports a rotating platform (RP), which is intended to support UAVs. The RP yaw, pitch and roll are measured by an inertial measurement unit, its climb/descend is measured by a low cost infrared proximity sensor and its rotation is measured by a rotary optical encoder. The hardware is coupled to a virtual environment (VE), which was developed using the Panda3D gaming engine. The VE includes a GUI to generate, edit, load and save real-life environments. Hardware manoeuvres are reflected into the VE. Findings The prototype was proven effective in dynamically mapping and tracking the rotating platform movements in the virtual environment. This should not be confused with the hardware in loop approach, which requires the inclusion of a mathematical model of the hardware in a loop. The finding will provide future means of testing navigation and tracking algorithms. Research limitations/implications The work is still new, and there is great room for improvement in many aspects. Here, this paper reports the concept and its technical implementation only. Practical implications In the literature, various testbeds were reported, and it is felt that there is still room to come up with a better design that enables UAV flying in safer and unlimited environments. This has many practical implications, particularly in testing control and navigation algorithms in hazardous fields. Social implications The main social impact is to utilise the concept to develop systems that are capable of autonomous rescue mission navigation in disaster zones. Originality/value The authors are aware that various researchers have developed various testbeds, at different degrees of freedom. Similarly, the authors are also aware that researchers have used game engines to simulate mobile robots or sophisticated equipment (like the VICON Motion Capture System) to measure to perform complex manoeuvres. However, the cost of this kind of equipment is very high, autonomous movements are planned in restricted environments and tested systems are only autonomous in certain setups. However, the idea of mapping the dynamics of an avatar flying object onto a 3D-VE is novel. To improve productivity and rapid prototyping, this paper proposes the use of commercially available game engines, such as the Panda3D, to create virtual environments © Emerald Group Publishing Limited [ISSN 0143-991X].",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84938802256

A total of 176 participants navigated a character (protagonist) through a two-dimensional browser game and rated the character's loneliness multiple times during the game. In the first part of the game, another character is introduced as the protagonist's spouse. At one point, the spouse leaves for an undetermined period of time but later returns. Immediately before this separation, higher ascribed loneliness of the protagonist was associated with more frequent interactions with the spouse. After the reunion, however, higher ascribed loneliness was associated with less frequent interactions with the spouse. Ascribed loneliness was not significantly related to the frequency of interactions with others nor to the frequency of solitary activities. These patterns held after controlling for ascribed positive affect. Participants' levels of loneliness were related to the level of ascribed loneliness only when the spouse was present but not when the spouse was absent. In sum, these findings suggest that the conditions that trigger the vicious cycle of loneliness are person- and situation-specific. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",24862659,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84922236041

Each position within a team has specific requirements which are typically based on speed, size and skill. The aim of this study was to investigate the contemporary demands of each position and whether they can explain changes in psychophysiological stress. Urine and saliva samples were collected before and after five selected Super 15 rugby games from 37 players. Total neopterin (NP), cortisol and immunoglobulin A were analysed by SCX-high performance liquid chromatography and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Global positioning system software provided distance data, while live video analysis provided impact data. All contemporary demands were analysed as events per minute of game time. Forwards were involved in more total impacts, tackles and rucks compared to backs (p < 0.001), while backs were involved in more ball carries and covered more total distance and distance at high speed per minute of game time (p < 0.01). Loose forwards, inside and outside backs covered significantly more distance at high speed (p < 0.01), while there was a negligible difference with number of impacts between the forward positions. There was also minimal difference between positions in the percentage change in NP, cortisol and sIgA. The results indicate distance covered and number of impacts per minute of game time is position-dependent whereas changes in psychophysiological stress are independent.

Conventional techniques involve amplification and filtering through analog circuits, which makes the system very unstable. The surface EMG signals lie in the frequency range of 6Hz to 600Hz, and the dominant range is between the ranges from 20Hz to 150Hz. Our project aimed to analyze an EMG signal effectively over its complete frequency range. To remove these defects, we designed what we think is an easy, effective, and reliable signal processing technique. We did spectrum analysis, so as to perform all the processing such as amplification, filtering, and thresholding on an Arduino Uno board, hence removing the need for analog amplifiers and filtering circuits, which have stability issues. The conversion of time domain to frequency domain of any signal gives a detailed data of the signal set. Our main aim is to use this useful data for an alternative methodology for rehabilitation called a psychophysiological approach to rehabilitation in prosthesis, which can reduce the cost of the myoelectric arm, as well as increase its efficiency. This method allows the user to gain control over their muscle sets in a less stressful environment. Further, we also have described how our approach is viable and can benefit the rehabilitation process. We used our DSP EMG signals to play an online game and showed how this approach can be used in rehabilitation. © Copyright AAMI 2015.",25793347,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928234076

However, selfish peers may refuse to be cooperative when considering their limited transmission resources. Incentive mechanisms are always used to guarantee successful cooperations among peers. Although the inventive mechanisms have been widely investigated on the basis of game theory, most researches assume that peers are well mixed in the network, regardless of the influence of peers' transaction relationships. In this paper, a novel analysis framework based on spatial evolutionary game theory is proposed to verify the effectiveness of incentive mechanisms. In the framework, a transaction overlay network is used to model the transaction relationships of peers. The transactions between clients and servers are modeled as the donor-recipient game to satisfy their asymmetric characters. Influences of the learning noise and some common behaviors of peers on incentive mechanisms are also considered. Moreover, in order to demonstrate the utility of the framework, a reciprocation-based incentive mechanism, which considers the requestors' behaviors of providing and consuming services, is thoroughly investigated under the framework in scenarios with homogeneous and heterogeneous benefits of services. By using the framework, besides the effectiveness of incentive mechanisms, the detailed spatiotemporal evolutions of peers' strategies driven by incentive mechanisms can also be obtained.

The emergence of sophisticated algorithms, new graphical user interfaces, laser scans and advanced 3D tools imparted further impetus towards the rapid advancement of complex virtual human facial model. Face-to-face communication being the most natural way of human interaction, the facial animation systems became more attractive in the information technology era for sundry applications. The production of computer-animated movies using synthetic actors are still challenging issues. Proposed facial expression carries the signature of happiness, sadness, angry or cheerful, etc. The mood of a particular person in the midst of a large group can immediately be identified via very subtle changes in facial expressions. Facial expressions being very complex as well as important nonverbal communication channel are tricky to synthesize realistically using computer graphics. Computer synthesis of practical facial expressions must deal with the geometric representation of the human face and the control of the facial animation. We developed a new approach by integrating blend shape interpolation (BSI) and facial action coding system (FACS) to create a realistic and expressive computer facial animation design. The BSI is used to generate the natural face while the FACS is employed to reflect the exact facial muscle movements for four basic natural emotional expressions such as angry, happy, sad and fear with high fidelity. The results in perceiving the realistic facial expression for virtual human emotions based on facial skin color and texture may contribute towards the development of virtual reality and game environment of computer aided graphics animation systems.Graphical Abstract: Realistic facial expressions of avatar. © 2015, 3D Research Center, Kwangwoon University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84921978049

The second is that the ludonarrative dissonance (via both Lukacs and Hocking) instigated by the merger of the closed, 'epic' form of the video game and the open-ended social aspects introduced in the MMO is a formal aesthetic response to late capitalism.

Weak signals, also conceptualised as trends, can be considered the most relevant input for developing foresight in an organisation. While detecting weak signals has traditionally relied on the news media, cultural products such as literature, movies, art, or computer games appear to have been neglected in the practice of foresight.However, literary genres such as novels can be a valuable source for developing foresight. Literature can be characterised as delivering ""thick descriptions"". Not only do novels describe social practices, but from them the reader also gains, for instance, deep insights into the feelings and emotions of the characters.These thick descriptions are even more interesting in the context of foresight when one considers that these descriptions play a role in the construction of social reality and therefore can influence, over time, reality, or rather translate fiction into fact. It can be argued that the new departs from cultural products, before translating into widely accepted social practices or mass-market products. The value of using literature in foresight also appears to be related to the notion that these narratives can be read as scenarios, revealing the potential of literature. Because of their narrative structure, these scenarios can overcome cognitive barriers in the development of foresight. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84922232725

The study objectives were 1) to determine if EBRs differ between adolescents who do and do not exergame; and 2) among exergamers, to describe the associations between EBRs and exergame duration, intensity, and achieving physical activity (PA) guidelines. Methods: This study was a cross-sectional analysis of data collected in mailed self-report questionnaires completed by 1243 students (mean ± SD<inf>age</inf> = 16.8 ± 0.5 years; 43% boys). Results: In girls, those who exergamed scored higher than nonexergamers on introjected (mean ± SD = 1.9 ± 1.0 vs.1.6 ± 0.9; P = .001) and identified (mean ± SD = 3.1 ± .0 vs.2.9 ± 0.9; P = .049) regulation. Exergame intensity was associated with identified regulation [OR (95% CI) = 2.2 (1.0, 4.5)], minutes exergaming per week was associated with amotivation [β (95% CI) = 0.4 (-0.0, 0.8)], and achieving guidelines was associated with external [OR (95% CI) = 3.7 (1.0, 13.4)] and identified [OR (95% CI) = 5.6 (2.0, 16.0)] regulations. In boys who exergamed, intrinsic regulation was associated with exergame duration [β (95% CI) = -0.3 (-0.6, 0.0)]. Conclusions: Girls who exergame may have partially internalized exergaming as a PA behavior. Boys may prefer other types of PA such as team sports or other more traditional videogames over exergaming or they may not view exergaming as PA. © 2015 Human Kinetics, Inc.",24829145,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929246231

The first theoretical framework refers to Arendt’s concept of the self-aware pariah, as opposed to the concept of parvenu. The second theory invoked refers to the work of Michel Foucault on parrhesia, seen as a risky yet empowering communicative game. In accordance with these theoretical premises, four political speeches delivered by Barack Obama, both when he was still a “strange” incumbent and after he had become president of the USA, were selected, given the high political risks these particular speeches were addressing. Extracts sharing autobiographical memories were analyzed with both a multimodal analysis of communication and an analysis of facial expressions of emotions (facial action coding system, or FACS). Results show that these autobiographical memories conveyed parrhesiastic narratives about the social origins of Obama as a pariah. Together with these risky rhetorical moves, emotional expressions (mainly negative) were clearly evident, yet well regulated. Our concluding remarks on this first explorative analysis suggest that Obama could apply a parrhesiastic attitude to himself – making clear to all his socially disadvantaged origins – in order to persuade his audience to accept a similar parrhesiastic game for communicating about difficult aspects of the political situation of his listeners.

For this purpose, realistic body motion, captured from human movements, is being used more frequently for creating characters with natural animations in games and entertainment. However, it is not always clear for programmers and designers which specific motion parameters best convey specific information such as certain emotions, intentions, or traits. We conducted two experiments to investigate whether the perceived traits of actors could be determined from their body motion, and whether these traits were associated with their perceived intentions. We first recorded body motions from 26 professional actors, who were instructed to move in a ""hero""-like or a ""villain""-like manner. In the first experiment, 190 participants viewed individual video recordings of these actors and were required to provide ratings to the body motion stimuli along a series of different cognitive dimensions (intentions, attractiveness, dominance, trustworthiness, and distinctiveness). The intersubject ratings across observers were highly consistent, suggesting that social traits are readily determined from body motion. Moreover, correlational analyses between these ratings revealed consistent associations across traits, for example, that perceived ""good"" intentions were associated with higher ratings of attractiveness and dominance. Experiment 2 was designed to elucidate the qualitative body motion cues that were critical for determining specific intentions and traits from the hero- and villain-like body movements. The results revealed distinct body motions that were readily associated with the perception of either ""good"" or ""bad"" intentions. Moreover, regression analyses revealed that these ratings accurately predicted the perception of the portrayed character type. These findings indicate that intentions and social traits are communicated effectively via specific sets of body motion features. Furthermore, these results have important implications for the design of the motion of virtual characters to convey desired social information. © 2015 ACM.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84946575271

Most power control algorithms only consider interference temperature constraint in single user scenario while ignoring the interference from PUs to SUs and minimum signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) requirement of SUs. In this paper, a distributed power control algorithm without user cooperation is proposed for multiuser underlay CNRs. Specifically, we focus on maximizing total throughput of SUs subject to both maximum allowable transmission power constraint and SINR constraint, as well as interference temperature constraint. To reduce the burden of information exchange and computational complexity, an average interference constraint is proposed. Parameter range and convergence analysis are given for feasible solutions. The resource allocation is transformed into a convex optimization problem, which is solved by using Lagrange dual method. In computer simulations, the effectiveness of our proposed scheme is shown by comparing with distributed constrained power control algorithm and Nash bargaining power control game algorithm.

Methods: Event-related potential (ERP) data were derived while 16 PGs and 20 HCs played a computer electronic gaming machine (EGM) task. Psychophysiological responses to outcomes commonly encountered during EGM gambling, including Large wins, Small wins, Near-wins, and Losses, were examined using a spatiotemporal principal components analysis (PCA). Subjects also completed questionnaires that assessed their levels of impulsivity, attraction to appetitive stimuli, and avoidance of aversive stimuli. Results: Losses elicited a feedback-related negativity (FRN), whereas wins elicited a feedback-related positivity (FRP) at the same latency and topography. PGs exhibited both attenuated FRN amplitudes following Losses and FRP amplitudes following Wins. Greater P3b amplitudes were found following Wins compared to Losses. FRN amplitudes following Near-wins were significantly reduced compared to Losses for both PGs and HCs. Trends for reduced P3b amplitudes following all outcome types, and for similar P3b amplitudes following Large and Small wins, were found for the PG group. Conclusions: We provide evidence that PGs are hyposensitive to both positive and negative outcomes.

Compared to organizationally centralized solutions, such as cloud storage, a decentralized storage system requires less trust in the provider and may result in smaller monetary costs. Our system is based on reciprocal storage contracts that allow the agents to adopt to changes in their replication partners' availability (by dropping inefficient contracts and forming new contracts with other partners). The data availability provided by the system is a function of the participating agents' availability. However, a straightforward system in which agents' matching is decentralized uses the given agent availability inefficiently. As agents are autonomous, the highly available agents form cliques replicating data between each other, which makes the system too hostile for the weakly available newcomers. In contrast, a centralized, equitable matching is not incentive compatible: it does not reward users for keeping their software running. We solve this dilemma by a mixed solution: an ""adoption"" mechanism in which highly available agents donate some replication space, which in turn is used to help the worst-off agents. We show that the adoption motivates agents to increase their availability (is incentive-compatible), but also that it is sufficient for acceptable data availability for weakly-available agents. © 2015 ACM.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84940970636

Previous studies showed an association between flow-experience and endogenous cortisol levels, suggesting an inverted, u-shaped relation between flow-experience and cortisol. However, these studies could not exclude effects of other stress factors. Objectives: The aim of this experiment was, therefore, to test the isolated effect of cortisol on flow-experience, independent of concomitant physiological and psychological stress responses, via controlled administration of exogenous cortisol. Methods: Sixty-four young healthy subjects (32 males, 32 females) participated in the experiment. According to a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over design, they received 20 mg oral cortisol on 1 day and placebo on the other day, respectively, with a time distance of 1 week between the experimental days. One hour after cortisol administration, participants engaged in the computer game Pacman. Pacman was delivered in five blocks of randomly differing difficulty levels. One block lasted 5 min. At the end of each block, participants rated flow-experience by the Flow Short Scale. Data was analyzed with hierarchical linear modeling. Subjects were not able to predict whether the pill they received contained cortisol or placebo. Results: Overall, results revealed a negative effect of oral 20 mg cortisol on flow-experience, with no differences between males and females. Conclusions: This study is the first to show that exogenous cortisol in a dose corresponding to a severe stressor impairs flow-experience. The observed negative effect of high cortisol dosage on experienced flow underlines recent findings of an inverted u-shaped relationship between cortisol and flow. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",25304863,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84923899719

Neurally, the left amygdala/hippocampus was activated in the conditions with blameworthy intention (i.e., intentional harm and failed attempt). The accidental (relative to intentional) harm activated the right temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and the anterior inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), while the failed attempt (relative to genuine no-harm) activated the anterior insula (AI) and the posterior IFG. Effective connectivity analysis revealed that in the unintentional conditions (i.e., accidental and failed attempt) the IFG received input from the TPJ and AI, and sent regulatory signals to the amygdala. These findings demonstrate that the processing of intention may gate the emotional responses to transgression and regulate subsequent reactive punishment. © 2015 the authors.",25810522,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925858604

Typically agents within the team have different roles and responsibilities, and ensuring proper coordination between them is critical for efficient mission execution. However, as the number of agents, system components, and mission tasks increase, planning for such teams becomes increasingly complex, motivating the development of algorithms that can operate in real-time dynamic environments. Given the complexity of the cooperative missions considered, there have been numerous solution approaches developed in recent years. This chapter provides an overview of three of the most common planning frameworks: integer programming, Markov decision processes, and game theory. The chapter also considers various architectural decisions that must be addressed when implementing online planning systems for multi-agent teams, providing insights on when centralized, distributed, and decentralized architectures might be good choices for a given application, and how to organize the communication and computation to achieve desired mission performance. Algorithms that can be utilized within the various architectures are identified and discussed, and future directions for research are suggested. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015.",,"English",Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-84944614235

Non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g. hand-washing or wearing face masks) can have a significant impact on the course of an infectious disease epidemic. The current study investigated whether protection motivation theory (PMT) is a useful framework for understanding social distancing behaviour (i.e. the tendency to reduce social contacts) in response to a simulated infectious disease epidemic. There were 230 participants (109 males, 121 females, mean age 32.4 years) from the general population who completed self-report measures assessing the components of PMT. In addition, participants completed a computer game which simulated an infectious disease epidemic in order to provide a measure of social distancing behaviour. The regression analyses revealed that none of the PMT variables were significant predictors of social distancing behaviour during the simulation task. However, fear (β =.218, p <.001), response efficacy (β =.175, p <.01) and self-efficacy (β =.251, p <.001) were all significant predictors of intention to engage in social distancing behaviour. Overall, the PMT variables (and demographic factors) explain 21.2% of the variance in intention. The findings demonstrated that PMT was a useful framework for understanding intention to engage in social distancing behaviour, but not actual behaviour during the simulated epidemic.

We continue on the theoretical path set by Nakajima and Higashi (1995, Indirect effects in ecological interaction networks (II): the conjugate variable approach. Mathematical Biosciences 130, 129-150) and extend their approach for quantifying indirect effects of press perturbations under steady-state conditions to pulse perturbations in steady state and to press and pulse perturbations under time-varying conditions. We illustrate with a commonly used lake ecosystem model how to estimate total, direct, and indirect effects on one species' biomass (e.g., game fish) from perturbations to a second species (e.g., forage fish). We use the daily output of species biomasses from multi-year model simulations to test whether the computed total, direct, and indirect effects are equal for pulse and press perturbations of equal magnitude, and whether the types (pulse and press) and timing of perturbations alter the relative importance of indirect effects. Our results were consistent with the original theory of Nakajima and Higashi; under steady-state conditions, press and pulse perturbations to the forage fish produced similar effects on the game fish. Under these same conditions, indirect effects on the game fish were more than 3.5 times larger than the direct effects. Under time-varying conditions, all classes of pulse effects, but not press, depended on the day the perturbation was imposed. Indirect effects of pulse and press perturbations under time-varying conditions were always negative (offsetting) and of similar magnitude as the direct effects. When forage fish biomass was growing rapidly, the indirect effect on game fish biomass of a pulse perturbation was relatively smaller compared to the direct effect, whereas the indirect and direct effects were similar at other times.

For example, generating human movements without key-frame data. Instead character animations can be created using biologically inspired algorithms in conjunction with physics-based systems. While the development of highly parallel processors, such as the graphical processing unit (GPU), has opened the door to performance accelerated techniques allowing us to solve complex physical simulations in reasonable time frames. The combined acceleration techniques in conjunction with sophisticated planning and control methodologies enable us to synthesize ever more realistic characters that go beyond pre-recorded ragdolls towards more self-driven problem solving avatars. While traditional data-driven applications of physics within interactive environments have largely been confined to producing puppets and rocks, we explore a constrained autonomous procedural approach. The core difficulty is that simulating an animated character is easy, while controlling one is more complex. Since the control problem is not confined to human type models, e.g., creatures with multiple legs, such as dogs and spiders, ideally there would be a way of producing motions for arbitrary physically simulated agents. This paper focuses on evolutionary genetic algorithms, compared to the traditional data-driven approach. We demonstrate generic evolutionary techniques that emulate physically-plausible and life-like animations for a wide range of articulated creatures in dynamic environments.

The imitation game originally proposed by Turing constitute a very effective method to prove the indistinguishability of an artificial agent. The behaviour of an agent is said to be indistinguishable from that of a human when observers (the so-called judges in the Turing test) cannot tell apart humans and non-human agents. Different environments, testing protocols, scopes and problem domains can be established to develop limited versions or variants of the original Turing test. In this paper we use a specific version of the Turing test, based on the international BotPrize competition, built in a First-Person Shooter video game, where both human players and non-player characters interact in complex virtual environments. Based on our past experience both in the BotPrize competition and other robotics and computer game AI applications we have developed three new more advanced controllers for believable agents: two based on a combination of the CERA-CRANIUM and SOAR cognitive architectures and other based on ADANN, a system for the automatic evolution and adaptation of artificial neural networks. These two new agents have been put to the test jointly with CCBot3, the winner of BotPrize 2010 competition (Arrabales et al.; 2012), and have showed a significant improvement in the humanness ratio. Additionally, we have confronted all these bots to both First-person believability assessment (BotPrize original judging protocol) and Third-person believability assessment, demonstrating that the active involvement of the judge has a great impact in the recognition of human-like behaviour. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

MF has been attributed to a mirror neuron system mediated mechanism, causing an excitability increment of primary motor cortex. It is still unclear whether the meaning an action assumes when performed in an interpersonal exchange context could affect MF.This study aims at exploring this issue by measuring MF induced by the observation of the same action coupled with opposite reward values (gain vs loss) in an economic game. Moreover, the interaction frame was manipulated by showing the same actions within different economic games, the Dictator Game (DG) and the Theft Game (TG). Both games involved two players: a Dictator/Thief and a receiver. Experimental participants played the game always as receivers whereas the Dictator/Thief roles were played by our confederates. In each game Dictator/Thief's choices were expressed by showing a grasping action of one of two cylinders, previously associated with fair/unfair choices. In the DG the dictator decides whether to share (gain condition) or not (no-gain condition) a sum of money with the receiver, while in TGs the thief decides whether to steal (loss condition) or not to steal (no-loss condition) it from the participants. While the experimental subjects watched the videos showing these movements, a single TMS pulse was delivered to their motor hand area and a MEP was recorded from the right FDI muscle.Results show that, in the DG, MF was enhanced by the status quo modification, i.e. MEP amplitude increased when the dictator decided to change the receivers' status quo and share his/her money, and this was true when the status quo was more salient. The same was true for the TG, where the reverse happened: MF was higher for trials in which the thief decided to steal the participants' money, thus changing the status quo, in the block in which the status quo maintenance occurred more often. Data support the hypothesis that the economic meaning of the observed actions differently modulates MEP amplitude, pointing at an influence on MF exerted by a peculiar interaction between economic outcomes and variation of the subjects' initial status quo. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",24983714,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84904673643

Recently, compressed sensing approaches have been investigated extensively for highly accelerated cine MRI by exploiting transform domain sparsity using linear transforms such as wavelets, and Fourier. However, in cardiac cine imaging, the cardiac volume changes significantly between frames, and there often exist abrupt pixel value changes along time. In order to effectively sparsify such temporal variations, it is necessary to exploit temporal redundancy along motion trajectories. This paper introduces a novel patch-based reconstruction method to exploit geometric similarities in the spatio-temporal domain. In particular, we use a low rank constraint for similar patches along motion, based on the observation that rank structures are relatively less sensitive to global intensity changes, but make it easier to capture moving edges. A Nash equilibrium formulation with relaxation is employed to guarantee convergence. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm clearly reconstructs important anatomical structures in cardiac cine image and provides improved image quality compared to existing state-of-the-art methods such as k-t FOCUSS, k-t SLR, and MASTeR. © 1982-2012 IEEE.",24951686,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84908576216

The state-of-the-art ACLS training is conducted in a face-to-face environment under expert supervision and suffers from several drawbacks including conflicting care provider schedules and high cost of training equipment. Objective: The major objective of the study is to describe, including the design, implementation, and evaluation of a novel approach of delivering ACLS training to care providers using the proposed virtual reality simulator that can overcome the challenges and drawbacks imposed by the traditional face-to-face training method. Methods: We compare the efficacy and performance outcomes associated with traditional ACLS training with the proposed novel approach of using a virtual reality (VR) based ACLS training simulator. One hundred and forty-eight (148) ACLS certified clinicians, translating into 26 care provider teams, were enrolled for this study. Each team was randomly assigned to one of the three treatment groups: control (traditional ACLS training), persuasive (VR ACLS training with comprehensive feedback components), or minimally persuasive (VR ACLS training with limited feedback components). The teams were tested across two different ACLS procedures that vary in the degree of task complexity: ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia (VFib/VTach) and pulseless electric activity (PEA). Results: The difference in performance between control and persuasive groups was not statistically significant (P= .37 for PEA and P= .1 for VFib/VTach). However, the difference in performance between control and minimally persuasive groups was significant (P= .05 for PEA and P= .02 for VFib/VTach). The pre-post comparison of performances of the groups showed that control (P= .017 for PEA, P= .01 for VFib/VTach) and persuasive (P= .02 for PEA, P= .048 for VFib/VTach) groups improved their performances significantly, whereas minimally persuasive group did not (P= .45 for PEA, P= .46 for VFib/VTach). Results also suggest that the benefit of persuasiveness is constrained by the potentially interruptive nature of these features. Conclusions: Our results indicate that the VR-based ACLS training with proper feedback components can provide a learning experience similar to face-to-face training, and therefore could serve as a more easily accessed supplementary training tool to the traditional ACLS training. Our findings also suggest that the degree of persuasive features in VR environments have to be designed considering the interruptive nature of the feedback elements. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",24732098,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84908017937

IMU are easy to wear also by the patient alone, but the extent to which IMU's malpositioning in routine use can affect the accuracy of the measurements is not known. A new such system (Riablo™, CoRehab, Trento, Italy), using audio-visual biofeedback based on videogames, was assessed against state-of-the-art gait analysis as the gold standard.Methods. The sensitivity of the system to errors in the IMU's position and orientation was measured in 5 healthy subjects performing two hip joint motion exercises. Root mean square deviation was used to assess differences in the system's kinematic output between the erroneous and correct IMU position and orientation.In order to estimate the system's accuracy, thorax and knee joint motion of 17 healthy subjects were tracked during the execution of standard rehabilitation tasks and compared with the corresponding measurements obtained with an established gait protocol using stereophotogrammetry.Results: A maximum mean error of 3.1 ± 1.8 deg and 1.9 ± 0.8 deg from the angle trajectory with correct IMU position was recorded respectively in the medio-lateral malposition and frontal-plane misalignment tests. Across the standard rehabilitation tasks, the mean distance between the IMU and gait analysis systems was on average smaller than 5°.Conclusions: These findings showed that the tested IMU based system has the necessary accuracy to be safely utilized in rehabilitation programs after orthopaedic treatments of the lower limb. © 2014 Leardini et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",25212257,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84907441826

In the vocal channel, Natural Language Interaction technologies today have some limitations when used in real-world natural environments and the models of expressivity of text to speech synthesis engines are not yet mature enough. To address these limitations, an alternative form of vocal communication - gibberish speech - is introduced in this paper. Gibberish speech consists of vocalizations of meaningless strings of speech sounds, and thus has no semantic meaning. It is occasionally used by performing artists or for cartoon animations and games to express intended emotions (e.g. Teletubbies and The Sims). In this paper, our approach for constructing expressive gibberish speech is described and the experimental evaluations with its intended robotic agents are reported.

Humans tend to protect fellow group members and fight against outsiders, even at substantial costs for themselves. Testosterone modulates responses to competition and social threat, but its exact role in the context of parochial altruism remains controversial. Here, we investigated how testosterone influences altruistic punishment tendencies in the presence of an intergroup competition. Fifty male soccer fans played an ultimatum game (UG), in which they faced anonymous proposers that could either be a fan of the same soccer team (ingroup) or were fans of other teams (outgroups) that differed in the degree of social distance and enmity to the ingroup. The UG was played in two contexts with varying degrees of intergroup rivalry. Our data show that unfair offers were rejected more frequently than fair proposals and the frequency of altruistic punishment increased with increasing social distance to the outgroups. Adding an intergroup competition led to a further escalation of outgroup hostility and reduced punishment of unfair ingroup members. High testosterone levels were associated with a relatively increased ingroup favoritism and also a change towards enhanced outgroup hostility in the intergroup competition. High testosterone concentrations further predicted increased proposer generosity in interactions with the ingroup. Altogether, a significant relation between testosterone and parochial altruism could be demonstrated, but only in the presence of an intergroup competition. In human males, testosterone may promote group coherence in the face of external threat, even against the urge to selfishly maximize personal reward. In that way, our observation refutes the view that testosterone generally promotes antisocial behaviors and aggressive responses, but underlines its rather specific role in the fine-tuning of male social cognition. © 2014 Diekhof et al.",25075516,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84905020729

In this work, we use concepts from non-cooperative game theory to model the interaction of autonomous peers. The client strategy set consists of feasible request load splits towards servers, while the server strategy set is formed out of possible service disciplines on received requests. The performance metric of interest is the average retrieval delay of content requests. First, we assume preassigned fixed server policies (FIFO and priority) and study the emerging client request load splitting game. Peers are either egotistic (i.e. interested only in optimizing their own delay) or altruistic ones that also take into account delay incurred to other peers. We consider best response updates to model iterative peer interaction. For egotistic peers, we show that the sequence of best responses always converges to the unique Nash Equilibrium Point (NEP). For altruistic peers best response updates converge to one of the multiple NEPs exist, with each one being a global optimum for the FIFO case and a local optimum for any other service strategy profile. We also consider mixed swarms consisting of both egotistic and (partially-) altruistic peers and show an interesting transition from one to multiple NEPs. Next, we include service strategies in the peer strategy set. Though with its service policy a peer cannot directly affect its delay, it can affect the resulting NEP. We devise two-level game models, where, at a first level, a peer selects its favorable service rule and then peers play a client load splitting game. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Evidence for and against the idea that dysfunctions in the mirror neuron system are involved in imitation and could be one underlying cause for ASD is discussed in this review. Neurofeedback interventions have reduced symptoms in children with ASD by self-regulation of brain rhythms. However, cortical deficiencies are not the only cause of these symptoms. Peripheral physiological activity, such as the heart rate and its variability, is closely linked to neurophysiological signals and associated with social engagement. Therefore, a combined approach targeting the interplay between brain, body, and behavior could be more effective. Brain-computer interface applications for combined neurofeedback and biofeedback treatment for children with ASD are currently nonexistent.

An increasing number of studies have focused on the development of training programs and have shown promising results. However, most of these programs are appropriate for individuals with high-functioning ASC (HFA) but exclude individuals with low-functioning ASC (LFA). We have developed a computer-based game called JeStiMulE based on logical skills to teach emotions to individuals with ASC, independently of their age, intellectual, verbal and academic level.The aim of the present study was to verify the usability of JeStiMulE (which is its adaptability, effectiveness and efficiency) on a heterogeneous ASC group. We hypothesized that after JeStiMulE training, a performance improvement would be found in emotion recognition tasks. Methods. A heterogeneous group of thirty-three children and adolescents with ASC received two one-hour JeStiMulE sessions per week over four weeks. In order to verify the usability of JeStiMulE, game data were collected for each participant. Furthermore, all participants were presented before and after training with five emotion recognition tasks, two including pictures of game avatars (faces and gestures) and three including pictures of real-life characters (faces, gestures and social scenes). Results: Descriptive data showed suitable adaptability, effectiveness and efficiency of JeStiMulE. Results revealed a significant main effect of Session on avatars (ANOVA: F (1,32) = 98.48, P <.001) and on pictures of real-life characters (ANOVA: F (1,32) = 49.09, P <.001). A significant Session × Task × Emotion interaction was also found for avatars (ANOVA: F (6,192) = 2.84, P =.01). This triple interaction was close to significance for pictures of real-life characters (ANOVA: F (12,384) = 1.73, P =.057). Post-hoc analyses revealed that 30 out of 35 conditions found a significant increase after training. Conclusions: JeStiMulE appears to be a promising tool to teach emotion recognition not only to individuals with HFA but also those with LFA. JeStiMulE is thus based on ASC-specific skills, offering a model of logical processing of social information to compensate for difficulties with intuitive social processing. Trial registration.

Inattention problems can lead to greater difficulties in completing assignments, as well as problems with time management and prioritisation of tasks.

This tele-system is based on the use of decision trees within Django, a high-level Python Web framework. The technologies and techniques used were selected so as to boost user involvement and to enable the system to be easily customised. This article shows the preliminary results of the pilot-phase in an experiment performed to evaluate the use of adaptive tele-therapies within a group of typically developing children and adolescents aged between 12 and 19 years old without ADHD. To do so, we relied on the collection of parameters and the conduct of surveys for assessing time management skills, as well as measuring system usability and availability. The results of a time management survey highlighted that the users involved in the trial did not use any specific or effective time management techniques, scoring 1.98 and 2.30 out of 5 points in this area for ages under 15 and over 16 years old, respectively. The final calculations based on the usability questionnaire resulted in an average score of 78.75 out of 100. The creation of a customisable tool capable of working with different skills, in conjunction with the replication of the current study, may help to understand these users' needs, as well as boosting time management skills among teenagers with and without ADHD. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",24402063,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84892158623

Additionally, a link that is in a local minority is rewired to a randomly chosen node. While large systems evolving under the majority rule alone always fall into disordered topological traps composed by frustrated links, any amount of rewiring is able to drive the network to complete order, by relinking frustrated links and so releasing the system from traps. However, depending on the relative rate of the majority rule and the rewiring processes, the system evolves towards different ordered absorbing configurations: either a one-component network with all links in the same state or a network fragmented in two components with opposite states.

Unknowingly, however, participants played against an AI, which was configured to produce a winning and a losing condition for each opponent by manipulating difficulty. Results indicated that opponent gender only had an effect on perceived stress, which was higher with male opponents. Moreover, players evaluated their own gaming skills as lower and the skills of presumed male opponents as higher when they thought they were playing against men.

Heart rate, blood lactate concentration, rating of perceived exertion and movement patterns of players were measured. Retrospective video analysis was performed to code for technical outcomes. Similar data were collected from 42 amateur, male cricket players (23.5 ± 4.7 year, 1.81 ± 0.07 m, 81.4 ± 11.4 kg) during one-day matches. Significant differences were found between Battlezone, traditional cricket training and one-day matches within each playing position. Specifically, Battlezone invoked the greatest physiological and physical demands from batsmen in comparison to traditional cricket training and one-day matches. However, the greatest technical demand for batsmen was observed during traditional cricket training. In regards to the other playing positions, a greater physiological, physical and technical demand was observed during Battlezone and traditional training than during one-day matches. These results suggest that the use of Battlezone and traditional cricket training provides players with a suitable training stimulus for replicating the physiological, physical and technical demands of one-day cricket. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",24404964,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84896737023

During gambling, players typically display an array of cognitive biases that create a distorted expectancy of winning. This study investigated brain regions underpinning gambling-related cognitive distortions, contrasting patients with focal brain lesions to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), insula, or amygdala (""target patients"") against healthy comparison participants and lesion comparison patients (i.e., with lesions that spare the target regions). A slot machine task was used to deliver near-miss outcomes (i.e., nonwins that fall spatially close to a jackpot), and a roulette game was used to examine the gambler's fallacy (color decisions following outcome runs). Comparison groups displayed a heightened motivation to play following near misses (compared with full misses), and manifested a classic gambler's fallacy effect. Both effects were also observed in patients with vmPFC and amygdala damage, but were absent in patients with insula damage.

Such systems require nonlinearity, be it through signal amplification, digitalization or the generation of autonomous dynamics such as oscillations. The biochemistry of DNA systems provides such mechanisms, but assembling them in a constructive manner is still a difficult and sometimes counterintuitive process. Moreover, realistic prediction of the actual evolution of concentrations over time requires a number of side reactions, such as leaks, cross-talks or competitive interactions, to be taken into account. In this case, the design of a system targeting a given function takes much trial and error before the correct architecture can be found. To speed up this process, we have created DNA Artificial Circuits Computer-Assisted Design (DACCAD), a computer-assisted design software that supports the construction of systems for the DNA toolbox. DACCAD is ultimately aimed to design actual in vitro implementations, which is made possible by building on the experimental knowledge available on the DNA toolbox. We illustrate its effectiveness by designing various systems, from Montagne et al.'s Oligator or Padirac et al.'s bistable system to new and complex networks, including a two-bit counter or a frequency divider as well as an example of very large system encoding the game Mastermind. In the process, we highlight a variety of behaviours, such as enzymatic saturation and load effect, which would be hard to handle or even predict with a simpler model. We also show that those mechanisms, while generally seen as detrimental, can be used in a positive way, as functional part of a design. Additionally, the number of parameters included in these simulations can be large, especially in the case of complex systems. For this reason, we included the possibility to use CMA-ES, a state-of-the-art optimization algorithm that will automatically evolve parameters chosen by the user to try to match a specified behaviour. Finally, because all possible functionality cannot be captured by a single software, DACCAD includes the possibility to export a system in the synthetic biology markup language, a widely used language for describing biological reaction systems.

Interoceptive awareness - the awareness of one's internal states - is important for such healthy regulation. Given the propensity for video games to induce stress, the associations between in-game and real world emotion regulation strategies during duress are worth exploring. We therefore present a method for measuring the interoceptive awareness of negative affect during stressful video game play, and investigate whether individual differences in this ability relate to emotion regulation strategies. Twenty-six proficient video game players were recruited to play a session of the video game Starcraft II in the lab. Players' physiological and subjective states of in-game negative arousal were measured consecutively. A comparison of these measures was used to calculate players' interoceptive awareness of real time in-game arousal. The relation between interoceptive awareness and a suite of emotion regulation strategies was then investigated. We observed a positive relation between in-game interoceptive awareness and the self-reported tendency to actively seek a resolution to negative affect. A positive trend was also observed between interoceptive awareness and the self-reported tendency to seek instrumental social support. Findings are discussed in terms of the relative effectiveness of different emotion regulation strategies for aiding in-game success. We further discuss the benefits and limitations of this pilot testing. In all, we hope to inspire future research into the associations between in-game arousal and emotion regulation strategies used in everyday life. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",24256133,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84898750139

College students played the game and completed questionnaires that assessed whether they had shared the games at two different time points: during game play and after game play. Positive emotions predicted sharing while students played the game, but negative emotions predicted whether the game was shared after initial game play. Game enjoyment predicted players' intentions to share the game, but it did not predict actual sharing behavior. Neither players' general use of sharing technologies nor their satisfaction related to sharing digital content predicted sharing intentions or behavior.

This team was formed by high-ranking managers in a large raid guild to conduct a raid in War of Worldcraft. They were interviewed with a set of 5-W questions developed according to the conceptualizations of team mental model (Levine & Moreland, 1991). Toward the interview protocol, a content analysis was conducted with two-cycle coding method from exploratory to explanatory and a hierarchical framework from code, category, theme, to theory were generated to describe the team mental model. In the first cycle, 17 codes were extracted from participants' own wording for concepts that were shared by whom controlled various gaming characters. These codes are knowledge convergence about the problem at-hand, actors, events, affects and outcomes - what the core gamers have experienced through the collaborative gaming process. In the second cycle, coding was guided by learning theories. Six categories, mingled from 17 codes, showed collective knowledge of co-work process, leaders' works, work under supervision, seeking joint fun, relationship oriented, and balance between extrinsic-intrinsic motivations. From 6 categories, two themes were synthesized: the team (1) performed ""joint hard work"" for (2) seeking ""joint hard fun."" The first theme comprised declarative and procedural knowledge representations and we consider it to be the commonality between this game team and ordinary work/learning teams. The second theme was composed of affective and cognitive evaluation components about intrinsic motivation which is in accordance with Self-determination theory (SDT, Deci & Ryan, 2000). In general, ""Jointly hard work for hard fun"" is the gist content of the team mental model. We found ample evidences that members explicitly recall shared motivational beliefs of team mates and emotional-motivational events in gaming. Based on the results of this study, several implications have been addressed for teachers to enhance students' intrinsic motivation in conducting quality Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning.

Our view is that organizational creativity orchestrates continuous interactions between different types of routines, operating at different levels of the organization. More precisely we propose distinguishing three types of routines: - First, the routines issued from formal structures or hierarchical working groups in the firm (functional groups, project teams, task force, etc.), for which the context of work and coordination of specialized tasks is defined ex ante by the hierarchy of the firm; - Second, the routines emerging from informal structures, the ""knowing communities"" which is a ""generic term that defines different types of autonomous learning groups of individuals (communities of practice, epistemic communities, and other more or less informal learning groups) united by common beliefs and interests who voluntarily share their resources on a long term basis in order to create and diffuse knowledge""; - Third, the routines that are inherently related to the organizational creativity of the firm, which are essentially corporate routines as expression of patterns of thinking, feeling and acting in the corporate culture. In essence they are the genes of collective identity, and take the shape of project management staging and gating principles and practices, framing collective divergent exploration and convergent production toward a creative goal. The contribution is based on an in-depth analysis of the organizational creativity in the world-leading videogame company, Ubisoft, with a special focus on the studio located in Montréal. To some extent, Ubisoft is one of the flagships of the ""creative industries"", in which the clear imperative is to sustain creativity on a permanent basis. These reasons explain the choice we made to test our approach of organizational creativity and routines in this firm. © 2014, Walter de Gruyter GmbH.

The piezomaterial is placed in the mouse at the interface between the button and the body. This paper reviews the parameters of the PVF2 piezomaterial and tests their possible implementation into EH systems utilizing these types of mechanical interactions. The paper tests the viability of two EH concepts: a battery management system, and a semi-autonomous system. A statistical estimate of the button operations is performed for various computer activities, showing that an average of up to 3300 mouse clicks per hour was produced for gaming applications, representing a tip frequency of 0.91 Hz on the PVF2 member. This frequency is tested on the PVF2 system, and an assessment of the two EH systems is reviewed. The results show that fully autonomous systems are not suitable for capturing low-frequency mechanical interactions, due to the parameters of current piezomaterials, and the resulting very long startup phase. However, a hybrid EH system which uses available power to initiate the circuit and eliminate the startup phase may be explored for future studies. © Czech Technical University in Prague, 2014.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84896816669

Seven studies, using multiple methods to manipulate player competence and a range of approaches for evaluating aggression, indicated that competence-impeding play led to higher levels of aggressive feelings, easier access to aggressive thoughts, and a greater likelihood of enacting aggressive behavior. Results indicated that player perceived competence was positively related to gaming motivation, a factor that was, in turn, negatively associated with player aggression.

Objective: to summarise evidence for the effectiveness and feasibility of VR/gaming system utilisation by older adults at home for enabling physical activity to improve impairments, activity limitations or participation. Methods: A systematic review searching 12 electronic databases from 1 January 2000-10 July 2012 using key search terms. Two independent reviewers screened yield articles using pre-determined selection criteria, extracted data using customised forms and applied the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool and the Downs and Black Checklist to rate study quality. Results: Fourteen studies investigating the effects of VR/gaming system use by healthy older adults and people with neurological conditions on activity limitations, body functions and physical impairments and cognitive and emotional well-being met the selection criteria. Study quality ratings were low and, therefore, evidence was not strong enough to conclude that interventions were effective. Feasibility was inconsistently reported in studies. Where feasibility was discussed, strong retention (≥70%) and adherence (≥64%) was reported. Initial assistance to use the technologies, and the need for monitoring exertion, aggravation of musculoskeletal symptoms and falls risk were reported.

Intervention strategies for individuals with LD include assistive computer-based technologies (ATs) to compensate for or maximize performance. However, research fails to assess the impact of ATs on performance, learning, and motivation of students with LD. Also, one of the limitations of ATs is that they cannot be used for assessment and training and there are very few methods to assess or train visual-motor skills in this population.

This is a preliminary step of developing an intervention to improve impaired visual-motor skills in adults with LD. A sample of 22 male and female university students with and without LD had their visual-motor skills pretested using a standard paper-and-pencil Bender-Gestalt (BG) test and were compared according to their performance on the MSA tool.

Results showed that participants without LD performed better and more rapidly on the VR task than participants with LD. There were no correlations between the BG and MSA performance. We did not find significant differences between the groups on the Bender-Gestalt scores, previous experience with video game, arousal, and mood. Our results suggest that a novel 3D virtual reality tool such as the MSA can potentially discriminate motor function of people with and without LD; however, the difference between both may also be due to a lack of problem-solving ability in LD. © 2014 Springer-Verlag London.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84893900064

The origin of these biases remains poorly understood. We investigated both inter- and intra-individual differences in egocentric justice biases. Participants played an ultimatum game presumably with different anonymous players (simulated by a computer) in which they contributed differentially to the joint production of the initial endowment. We examined how contributions (low vs. high) affect proposers' offers and responders' acceptance decisions, as well as their fairness judgments and their emotional reactions to different types of offers (equal, equitable, unfair, and hyperfair). An egocentric bias in proposers' offers (indicating more flexible preferences) was found only in individualists and not in prosocials, suggesting differences in the motivations (or cognitions) underlying their choice of justice norms. Responders also showed egocentric biases in their judgments of fairness and in their emotional reactions to equal and equitable offers, but not in their acceptance decisions. Such dissociation might suggest that some form of emotion regulation occurred. Responders may evaluate offers on valence dimensions (e.g., goal conduciveness/outcome favorability and norm compatibility/justice) that are multiply interacting and potentially conflicting. The individual's acceptance/rejection decision reflects the relative weight attributed to competing appraisals. For this overt behavioral decision, the (personal) appraisal of outcome favorability that drives (analytical) acceptance of goal-conducive outcome seems to be stronger than the (social) appraisal of outcome fairness, which may trigger covert (emotional) rejection of offers that are incompatible with justice norms. Our data show that the emotional reaction patterns provide a more fine-grained readout of the overall evaluation of the proposer's action, the underlying emotional dynamics of which may, in real life, strongly determine future interactions with specific partners. Further research on the relationship between emotion and behavior in economic games is needed to explore potential dissociations and long-term effects. © 2014 Bediou, Scherer.",24586326,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84896532635

In Experiment 1, participants who were unexperienced in the respective sports watched short videos depicting basketball and table tennis players and rated whether athletes were trailing or leading. Results indicated that participants could significantly differentiate between trailing and leading athletes in both team and individual sports. Experiment 2 showed that children were also able to distinguish between trailing and leading athletes based on nonverbal behavior. Comparison with the adult results from Experiment 1 revealed that the adult ratings corresponded to a higher degree with the actual scores during the game compared to the children's. In Experiment 3, we replicated the findings from Experiment 1 with both expert and unexperienced participants and a different set of stimuli from team handball. Both experts and unexpert participants were able to differentiate between leading and trailing athletes. Our findings are in line with evolutionary accounts of nonverbal behavior and suggest that humans display nonverbal signals as a consequence of leading or trailing which are reliably interpreted by others. By comparing this effect as a function of different age groups we provide evidence that although even young children can differentiate between leading and trailing athletes, the decoding of subtle nonverbal cues continues to develop with increasing experience and maturation processes. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84893500753

A total of 656 experiences from 483 gamers were collected from 54 online gaming forums. The findings suggest that intensive playing can result in misperceptions and visual distortions of real-life objects and environments, stereotypical visual experiences that arise from mind visualization, and pseudo-hallucinatory experiences with video game content. Gamers' experiences can be explained by the interplay of physiological, perceptual, and cognitive mechanisms. Observation of video game features suggests that in most cases a relationship between the games' structural characteristics, gamers' VGTP experiences, and gamers' playing habits appeared relevant. VGTP can occur while gaming, immediately after stopping play, or after some delay.

At my first gaming conference, I discovered the value of simulations and games by playing games rather than by listening to lectures. I found the spirit of play and cooperation at NASAGA and ISAGA conferences refreshing and my games owe a considerable debt to the experienced gamers I met there. My experience facilitating games has taught me that allowing a few players to judge the work of their peers using subjective criteria leads to negative emotions, which may cancel any potential benefits of a game. I have also learned that the NEW COMMONS GAME, which illustrates the tragedy of the commons, may leave players feeling helpless and fatalistic about solving real-world commons problems. Several strategies are presented that counter negative feelings and instill optimism in players that commons problems can be solved. Recent developments in the video gaming community provide grounds for optimism about the future of educational gaming. However, it is imperative that video game designers who have an educational goal incorporate the knowledge that educational gamers have acquired over the past 50 years, such as the need for debriefing. A hypothetical, long-term, large-scale game is described that has the potential to educate students campuswide about how a commons resource can be sustained for the benefit of all. In addition, if the game is conducted across semesters or years, players' responsibility to future generations of players could be studied and enhanced. However, the hypothetical game would require revising current thinking about debriefing.

The purpose of this research was to identify contributors to PBC; examine relationships between PBC, team performance, and perceived team attributes (e.g., cohesion, trust); and compare a set of time-series measures(cross-correlation [CC], cross-recurrence quantification analysis [CRQA], and cross-fuzzy entropy [CFEn]) in their characterization of PBC across comparisons. To accomplish this, PBC was examined in human postural sway (PS) and cardiac interbeat intervals (IBIs) from dyadic teams performing a fast-paced puzzle task (Quadra-a variant of the video game Tetris). Results indicated that observed levels of PBC were not a chance occurrence, but instead driven by features of the team-task environment, and that PBC was likely influenced by similar individual task demands and interpersonal coordination dynamics that were not ""unique"" to a particular team. Correlation analysis revealed that PBC exhibited negative relationships with team performance and team attributes, which were interpreted to reflect complementary coordination (as opposed to mimicry) during task performance, potentially due to differentiated team roles. Finally, qualitative comparison of timeseries measures used to characterize PBC indicated that CRQA percent recurrence and CFEn (both nonlinear measures) settled on mostly analogous characterizations, whereas linear CC did not. The disparity observed between the linear and nonlinear measures highlights underlying computational and interpretational differences between the two families of statistics and supports the use of multiple metrics for characterizing PBC. © 2013 American Psychological Association.",23750969,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84893030325

These individuals must not only deal with the direct consequences of their disease, but they must often cope with being in a hospital or at home, being unable in many cases go to school. Frequently, connections with classmates, neighbours, and sometimes even some with relatives are lost. Therefore, entertainment and enjoyment should be provided in order to avoid boredom and to improve their affective state. Currently, children in the HUC (University Hospital of the Canary Islands) have a classroom with computers, books and toys supervised by a teacher. Children in their individual rooms are isolated.

Fifteen males and 14 females (mean age, 25.6 years; height, 171.3 cm; weight, 71.8 kg) randomly selected (by a coin toss) heavy bag boxing or ""Wii Boxing"" for their first test session and completed the other protocol at their second session at least 2 days later.

From childhood, stories play an important role in human development, in that, for instance, humans automatically construct a storyline so that they can associate information. There is research to suggest that storytelling in video games can be beneficial because it can be used to help players identify with characters and their goals, creating a greater sense of immersion, positive feelings, and more physiological arousal. Furthermore, when the content is specific and targeted, these games are well suited for promoting acquisition, maintenance, and generalization of skills and knowledge. Findings such as these hold immense promise in the context of improving social skills for children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Thus, the use of computers and video games, combined with more traditional storytelling, may serve as hopeful tools for motivating and engaging students as well as promoting learning.

N=81 male participants were randomly assigned to either play an action-shooter or a racing game before engaging in a game on risk-taking behavior and performing a cold pressor task (CPT).

However, it is unresolved whether MDD patients show abnormalities in decision making in a social interaction context, in which decisions have actual influences on both the self-interests of the decision makers per se and those of their partners.Methods: Using a well-studied ultimatum game (UG), which is frequently used to investigate social interaction behavior, we examined whether MDD can be associated with abnormalities in social decision-making behavior by comparing the acceptance rates of MDD patients (N = 14) with those of normal controls (N = 19).Results: The acceptance rates of the patients were lower than those of the normal controls. Additionally, unfair proposals were accepted at similar rates from computer partners and human partners in the MDD patients, unlike the acceptance rates in the normal controls, who were able to discriminatively treat unfair proposals from computer partners and human partners.Conclusions: Depressed patients show abnormal decision-making behavior in a social interaction context. Several possible explanations, such as increased sensitivity to fairness, negative emotional state and disturbed affective cognition, have been proposed to account for the abnormal social decision-making behavior in patients with MDD. This aberrant social decision-making behavior may provide a new perspective in the search to find biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of MDD. © 2014 Wang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",24450703,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84892770198

Characterizing the biological mechanisms underlying a wide range of frustration tolerance observed in early childhood may inform maladaptive behavior and psychopathology that is associated with this construct. The goal of this study was to measure prefrontal correlates of frustration in 3-5-year-old children, who are not readily adaptable for typical neuroimaging approaches, using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). fNIRS of frontal regions were measured as frustration was induced in children through a computer game where a desired and expected prize was ""stolen"" by an animated dog. A fNIRS general linear model (GLM) was used to quantify the correlation of brain regions with the task and identify areas that were statistically different between the winning and frustrating test conditions. A second-level voxel-based ANOVA analysis was then used to correlate the amplitude of each individual's brain activation with measure of parent-reported frustration. Experimental results indicated increased activity in the middle prefrontal cortex during winning of a desired prize, while lateral prefrontal cortex activity increased during frustration. Further, activity increase in lateral prefrontal cortex during frustration correlated positively with parent-reported frustration tolerance. These findings point to the role of the lateral prefrontal cortex as a potential region supporting the regulation of emotion during frustration. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",23624495,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84889646505

There were no main effects for caffeine administration on sAA, salivary cortisol, or cardiovascular measures, and caffeine did not interact with the task to alter these measures. Conclusions: Laboratory administered caffeine does not alter sAA activity, even when sAA activity is stimulated by participating in a cognitively engaging task. These data demonstrate that caffeine administration does not affect sAA activity, at least in healthy young men who regularly consume caffeine. Results support recent findings that basal caffeine levels in habitual caffeine users are not associated with basal sAA activity and that daily caffeine intake and diurnal sAA activity are not related. © 2014 Klein et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",24410993,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84892414987

CBTs for pathological gambling accurately address the cognitive processes of gamblers, but the typical functionings of video game players are not widely discussed in video game addiction CBT. This study clarifies these variables through content analysis of individual interviews conducted with frequent and/or excessive video game players. These players are characterized by high weekly gaming time (WGT), numerous years of playing practice and a PVP's score (Problem Video Game Playing Questionnaire) significantly correlated to WGT. These interviews focus on five key moments of the game: ""Before"", ""During"" and ""After"" the game, and when ""Winning"" or ""Losing"". A wide range of video games is taken into account both online and offline. The results, in conjunction with the existing literature, update variables known to cognitive psychology (various but specific emotions and physical manifestations; anticipatory, relief-oriented and permissive beliefs; attentional resources; etc.) and the dynamic richness of which is demonstrated according to the five playing moments. These specific variables provide a sound basis for studies concerning excessive video games use and for gaming experiences focused CBTs. © 2014 Association française de thérapie comportementale et cognitive.

Sixteen pre-pubertal healthy children participated in this study. After familiarization with procedures and anthropometric evaluation, participants performed three sessions in randomized order: (1) 30 min of traditional Brazilian games (PLAY); (2) 30 min of video game playing (DDR); and (3) 30 min of watching TV (TV). Each session lasted 80 min, being 10 min of rest; 30 min of intervention activity; and 40 min of recovery. After recovery, the Cold Pressor Test (CPT) was used for the assessment of acute cardiovascular reactivity. BP was recorded at 30 s and 1 min during the CPT. Analysis of variance showed post-exercise hypotension (PEH) only after PLAY, and that systolic and diastolic BP were significantly increased in all conditions during CPT. However, the magnitude of the CPT-induced BP response was significantly less in PLAY compared to DDR and TV. The PEH observed during recovery and the reduced BP response to CPT following playing traditional games may be due its higher cardiovascular and metabolic demand as was indicated by the increased heart rate, oxygen consumption, and BP. It was concluded that BP reactivity to stress may be reduced through a previous single session of traditional games and that PEH was recorded only after this exercise form. This benefit indicates a potential role of playing strategies for cardiovascular health in childhood. © 2014 Rauber, Boullosa, Carvalho, de Moraes, de Sousa, Simões and Campbell.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84904404031

In this study, both background music within video games and the games themselves were used as two independent variables to test their influence on physical excitement and aggression. Physical excitement was measured using biofeedback equipment and aggression was measured using the hot sauce paradigm. Results showed that both music and video games can cause significant increases in physical excitement, while violent video games cause higher levels of physical excitement than non-violent games. The excitement level of the background music interacted with the game content to give a combined effect on aggression. Thus, the present study extended prior findings by showing that background music has an indispensable role in the level of aggression induced through video games.

The variation in cardiovascular responses between the three exergames was also examined. Design: We employed a cross-sectional laboratory design. Methods: We recruited 18 girls to participate in a peak VO2 test and to play Gamercize, Kinect River Rush, XaviX J-Mat at three separate exergaming sessions. Linear regression equations of heart rate and percentage of peak VO2 were calculated for each participant to determine the intensity of exergame play. Differences in intensity between the three exergames and time spent in the recommended moderate (heart rate at ≥55% peak VO2) and vigorous (heart rate at ≥75% peak VO2) intensity levels were analyzed. We calculated the coefficient of variation for the mean heart rate to determine the difference in variance in heart rate values for the three exergames. Results: When playing Gamercize and Kinect the girls did not play at recommended moderate or vigorous levels. Although the girls did not play at vigorous levels when playing XaviX J-Mat, our results showed that when playing XaviX J-Mat they did play at moderate intensity levels.

This paper approaches the issue by combining two general psychological theories: Self-determination Theory (Deci & Ryan, 2000) and Social Identity Theory (Tajfel & Turner, 1986). A large scale survey (N = 7252) enabled a comparison of three groups which differed in terms of their Gamer Identity Strength (GIS), namely the degree to which players define gaming as part of their social identity. GIS is highest in Hardcore gamers and lower for Heavy and Casual gamers. GIS was positively, and uniformly, related with needs for Competence, Autonomy and Relatedness. Meanwhile, regulation was greater and more internal in the higher GIS groups. Finally, persistence was found to increase with GIS. The structure of needs and regulation modes underlying persistence was comparatively analyzed for the three groups; similarities between GIS groups were more frequent than differences. Most importantly, results indicated that Casual and Heavy gamers were motivated to continue to play as a result of both the feelings of enjoyment and a sense of connectedness. Hardcore gamers were more intrinsically motivated through enjoyment enhancing their levels of persistence accordingly. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This study was conducted to find out whether it is possible to stress soldiers moderately using VR and which technology is more efficient to do so. A total of 47 soldiers returning from Afghanistan played two 3D firstperson shooter (FPS)/horror games (Killing Floor and Left 4 Dead) on three different types of immersive technologies (a 22-inch stereoscopic monitor, a 73-inch stereoscopic TV and a CAVE™).

Results were supporting of our work, devising an effective low-cost and high-buy-in approach to assist in teaching and practicing stress-management skills. Repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) revealed statistically significant increases in the soldiers’ respiration rates and heart rates while playing the 3D games and during the TSSTs. No significant interactions were found. Increases in physiological arousal among the soldiers were significant when comparing the baseline to the immersion and to the TSST, but not when comparing both stressors.

Compared with the existing works, our main contributions include the following. A novel feature – shot intensity is exploited to replace the motion activity, which greatly improves the computational performance of affection arousal model. Another helpful feature – replay factor is designed and successfully fused into the affection arousal model. This makes the affection arousal model reflect the variation of the true match process more accurately. In addition, event temporal transition pattern (ETTP) in soccer video is utilized to detect highlights boundaries effectively combined with the affection arousal curve.

The vast majority of research by psychologists on the effects of ""gaming"" has been on its negative impact: the potential harm related to violence, addiction, and depression. We recognize the value of that research; however, we argue that a more balanced perspective is needed, one that considers not only the possible negative effects but also the benefits of playing these games. Considering these potential benefits is important, in part, because the nature of these games has changed dramatically in the last decade, becoming increasingly complex, diverse, realistic, and social in nature. A small but significant body of research has begun to emerge, mostly in the last five years, documenting these benefits. In this article, we summarize the research on the positive effects of playing video games, focusing on four main domains: cognitive, motivational, emotional, and social. By integrating insights from developmental, positive, and social psychology, as well as media psychology, we propose some candidate mechanisms by which playing video games may foster real-world psychosocial benefits. Our aim is to provide strong enough evidence and a theoretical rationale to inspire new programs of research on the largely unexplored mental health benefits of gaming. Finally, we end with a call to intervention researchers and practitioners to test the positive uses of video games, and we suggest several promising directions for doing so. © 2013 American Psychological Association.",24295515,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84892840237

Informed by research on out-of-class L2 learning, this paper discusses findings from an exploratory study investigating L2 gaming and learning practices in young people's everyday lives. Drawing on rich data from gaming sessions, stimulated recall, focus group discussion, individual interviews and online discussion forums, this paper argues that gamers exercise autonomy by managing their gameplay both as leisure and learning practices in different dimensions (location, formality, locus of control, pedagogy and trajectory). At the same time, gameplay-as-learning practices are supported by wider communities of digital gamers who take on roles as language teachers and advisers.

AVG play can result in light-to-moderate intensity physical activity. What this study adds A comparison correcting for body size between the energy expended by children with obesity and those of a healthy weight playing AVGs. An examination of several variables related to the energy cost of AVG play including steps taken and rate of perceived exertion. There may be some differences in how children with obesity and children of a healthy weight play AVGs. Background Increasing physical activity and reducing sedentary behaviour form a large part of the treatment of paediatric obesity. However, many children today spend prolonged periods of time playing sedentary video games. Active video games (AVGs) represent a novel and child friendly form of physical activity. Objectives To measure the energy cost of playing two AVGs in children with obesity and healthy age- and gender-matched children. Methods The energy cost of gaming and heart rates achieved during gaming conditions were compared between groups. Results AVG play can result in light-to-moderate intensity physical activity (2.7-5.4metabolic equivalents). When corrected for fat-free mass those with obesity expended significantly less energy than healthy weight peers playing Nintendo Wii Fit Free Jogging (P=0.017). No significant difference was seen between groups in the energy cost of playing Boxing. Conclusion Certain AVGs, particularly those that require lower limb movement, could be used to increase total energy expenditure, replace more sedentary activities, or achieve moderate intensity physical activity among children with obesity. There seems to be some differences in how children with obesity and children of a healthy weight play AVGs. This could result in those with obesity expending less energy than their lean peers during AVG play. © 2013 The Authors.

Video-game playing was significantly associated with high added sugar and low fibre consumption. A higher level of dietary restraint was observed in non-frequent video-game users.Conclusions: These preliminary results identify frequent video-game playing as an important lifestyle behaviour which may have important implications for understanding obesity risk in young male adults. © 2014, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",24821488,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84920166740

We have previously demonstrated the usefulness of PlayMancer in reducing impulsivity and improving emotional regulation in bulimia nervosa (BN) patients. However, whether these improvements are actually translated into brain changes remains unclear. Objective: The aim of this case study was to report on a 28-year-old Spanish woman with BN, and to examine changes in physiological variables and brain activity after a combined treatment of video game therapy (VGT) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Methods: Ten VGT sessions were carried out on a weekly basis. Anxiety, physiological, and impulsivity measurements were recorded. The patient was scanned in a 1.5-T magnetic resonance scanner, prior to and after the 10-week VGT/CBT combined treatment, using two paradigms: (1) an emotional face-matching task, and (2) a multi-source interference task (MSIT). Results: Upon completing the treatment, a decrease in average heart rate was observed. The functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) results indicated a post-treatment reduction in reaction time along with high accuracy. The patient engaged areas typically active in healthy controls, although the cluster extension of the active areas decreased after the combined treatment. Conclusions: These results suggest a global improvement in emotional regulation and impulsivity control after the VGT therapy in BN, demonstrated by both physiological and neural changes. These promising results suggest that a combined treatment of CBT and VGT might lead to functional cerebral changes that ultimately translate into better cognitive and emotional performances. ©Ana Beatriz Fagundo, Esther Via, Isabel Sánchez, Susana Jiménez-Murcia, Laura Forcano, Carles Soriano-Mas, Cristina Giner-Bartolomé, Juan J Santamaría, Maher Ben-Moussa, Dimitri Konstantas, Tony Lam, Mikkel Lucas, Jeppe Nielsen, Peter Lems, Narcís Cardoner, Jose M Menchón, Rafael de la Torre, Fernando Fernandez-Aranda.",25116416,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84907541026

Instead, for an NPC that needs emotions the game developer defines goals and annotates game events with a relation to these goals. Based on this input, GAMYGDALA produces an emotion for that NPC according to the well-known OCC model.

Dreams have been shown to be continuous with waking mentation (Schredl, 2003) and to regulate negative emotions (Levin & Nielsen, 2009). Thus, they may offer a relatively unobstrusive measure of reactions to media use. Although there were meaningful differences between the 4 groups (high VGP/high SMU; high VGP/low SMU; low VGP/high SMU; low VGP/low SMU), most analysis resulted in no differences in dreams. Differences seemed to support the nightmare protection thesis of video game play such that high-end gamers, no matter the degree of social media use, suffered less from these negative types of dreams. Additionally, the high VGP/high SMU group had the thinnest psychological boundaries and thus were perhaps most susceptible to media effects.

Hemodynamics, pro-BNP samples and DF indices were obtained throughout the protocol. Separate regression analyses were conducted using rest and stress E/A, E' and E/E' as dependent variables. Predictor variables were entered into the stepwise regression models in a hierarchical fashion. At the first level, age, sex, race, height, body mass index, pro-BNP and left ventricular mass (LVM) were permitted to enter the models. The second level consisted of systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR). The final level contained cross-product terms of race by SBP, DBP and HR.Results: E/A ratio was lower during stress compared to rest and recovery (P &lt; 0.01).

To characterize the energy expenditure (EE), exercise intensity, and energy metabolism of individuals poststroke, while playing AVGs in different positions, from different consoles, and to compare the performance with comfortable walking and with able-bodied individuals. Methods. Eleven poststroke and 8 able-bodied participants played in standing Wii-Boxing Xbox-Boxing, Wii-Run and Penguin, and also Wii-Boxing in sitting. EE (expressed as metabolic equivalents [METs]); exercise intensity (expressed as %predicted maximal heart rate [HR]), rate of perceived exertion (RPE), and respiratory exchange ratio (RER) were used to characterize the games. Results. Participants' poststroke EE ranged from 1.81 ± 0.74 to 3.46 ± 1.3 METs and was lower compared with able-bodied participants for Xbox-Boxing (P =.001), Wii-Boxing in standing (P =.01), Run (P <.001), and Penguin (P =.001).

Good quality evidence on contributory environmental factors such as seeing aggression on television and in video games is relatively lacking, although societal and professional concerns are high. This study investigated possible associations between seeing aggression in such media and the aggressive behaviour of children attending specialist outpatient child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS). Methods: In this mixed methods study, forty-seven British children aged 7-11 years with behavioural/emotional difficulties attending CAMHS and their carers participated in a survey twenty purposively-selected children and a parent/carer of theirs participated in a qualitative study, involving semi-structured interviews, analysed using the Framework Analysis Approach; findings were integrated. Results: Children attending CAMHS exhibit clinically significant aggression, of varying types and frequency. They see aggression in multiple real and virtual settings. Verbal aggression was often seen, frequently exhibited and strongly associated with poor peer relationships and low prosocial behaviour. Children did not think seeing aggression influences their own behaviour but believed it influences others. Carers regarded aggression as resulting from a combination of inner and environmental factors and seeing aggression in real-life as having more impact than television/video games. Conclusions: There is yet no definitive evidence for or against a direct relationship between aggression seen in the media and aggression in children with behavioural/emotional difficulties. Future research should take an ecological perspective, investigating individual, developmental and environmental factors. Carers, professional organisations and policy makers should address aggression seen in all relevant area of children's lives, primarily real-life and secondly virtual environments. © 2014 Mitrofan et al.",25404041,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84964316154

In the age of drone technology, this role shifts from a position of strength to one of relative weakness. Although video games that feature future combat often ""function as virtual enactments and endorsements for developing military technologies,"" Black Ops II offers a surprisingly complex vision of the future of drones and U.S. soldiers (Smicker 2009: 107). To explore how the game reflects a contemporary vision of the U.S. military, I weave together a close textual reading of two levels in Black Ops II with actual accounts from drone pilots and politicians that illuminate the nature of drone combat. Although there are moments in Black Ops II in which avatars combat enemies with first-hand firepower, the experience of heroic diegetic violence is superseded by a combat experience defined by powerlessness, boredom, and ambiguous pleasure. The shift of the soldier from imposing hero to a banal figure experiences its logical conclusion in Unmanned, an independent video game that foregrounds the mundane, nonviolent nature of drone piloting. Instead of training soldiers to withstand emotionally devastating experiences of death and violence first-hand (or to physically enact such violence), games like Black Ops II and Unmanned train actual and potential soldiers to tolerate monotony and disempowerment. © The author(s), 2014.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84904970496

We conducted a between-participants experiment in which participants (N = 119) played an exergame under one of the three levels of user interface embodiment (low, medium, and high). Our results revealed a significant positive main effect of user interface embodiment on user experience (i.e., the sense of being in the game, ""presence,"" and enjoyment); level of energy expenditure (change in heart rate); and intention to further engage in exergame-play exercise but not necessarily to increase exercise in the physical world.

A total of 152 youth players participated, with 45 U10 players playing 5v5 and 8v8 games, and 41 U13 players playing 8v8 and 11v11 (20min) games. Activity profile, heart rate (HR), and technical actions were measured during all games using 10Hz GPS, video filming, and HR monitors. For U10, no difference was found in total distance covered (1754±237 vs 1771±314m, P=0.650, d=0.06), whereas mean HR (174±10 vs 168±12bpm, P=0.001, d=0.59) and number of technical actions (65.1±24.0 vs 36.9±20.4, P<0.001, d=1.27) were higher in 5v5 than in 8v8. For U13, lower total distance covered (1821±325 vs 2038±328m, P<0.001, d=0.66) and higher number of technical actions (36.2±14.9 vs 26.9±14.1, P<0.001, d=0.64) were observed in 8v8 than in 11v11, with no difference in mean HR (170±10 vs 171±10bpm, P=0.679, d=0.10). In conclusion, HR is high in youth football matches irrespective of the level of play and the game format. Playing with fewer players on smaller pitches results in minor changes to the physical loading but elevates the technical involvement of youth players both at elite level and recreational level. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

I argue that video games allow their developers to address players as though they were participants in ongoing conflicts, rather than passive observers, and that this style of presentation is extremely useful to efforts to create an attractive image of people who are frequently described as ‘terrorists’. Video games also enable their developers to carefully construct media narratives that appear to be realistic depictions of contemporary conflicts even when those narratives show signs of bias. Through these mechanisms, video games provide violent non-state actors and organizations sympathetic to them with a means of presenting their grievances and displaying their fighting prowess in ways that advance the organizations' strategic goals. © 2014, Centre of International Studies.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84919876590

We investigated whether an online spaced-education (SE) game among primary care clinicians can decrease time to BP target among their hypertensive patients. Methods and Results-A 2-arm randomized trial was conducted over 52 weeks among primary care clinicians at 8 hospitals. Educational content consisted of 32 validated multiple-choice questions with explanations on hypertension management. Providers were randomized into 2 groups: SE clinicians were enrolled in the game, whereas control clinicians received identical educational content in an online posting. SE game clinicians were e-mailed 1 question every 3 days. Adaptive game mechanics resent questions in 12 or 24 days if answered incorrectly or correctly, respectively. Clinicians retired questions by answering each correctly twice consecutively. Posting of relative performance among peers fostered competition. Primary outcome measure was time to BP target (>140/90 mm Hg). One hundred eleven clinicians enrolled. The SE game was completed by 87% of clinicians (48/55), whereas 84% of control clinicians (47/56) read the online posting. In multivariable analysis of 17 866 hypertensive periods among 14 336 patients, the hazard ratio for time to BP target in the SE game cohort was 1.043 (95% confidence interval, 1.007-1.081; P=0.018). The number of hypertensive episodes needed to treat to normalize one additional patient's BP was 67.8. The number of clinicians needed to teach to achieve this was 0.43.

Post-concussion symptoms and impaired balance are two factors that limit return to activity. Post-injury assessments that challenge activity tolerance and balance skills are needed to ensure readiness to return to activity. This cross-sectional study evaluated the Nintendo Wii as a measure of exertion (heart rate HR, respiration rate RR, and caloric expenditure) and balance testing for youth with MTBI in a clinical setting. Twenty-four youth with MTBI, ages 9-18, played six Wii games. The Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency 2nd edition (BOT-2) and the Community Balance and Mobility Scale (CBM) were used as balance indicators. The Wii Fit Running game demonstrated the highest caloric expenditure and HR (p = .010). Frequency counts of balance loss during Wii game play did not correlate with performance on the BOT-2 or the CBM. Type, number, and time since injury were predictive of balance performance on the CBM (p = .008).

METHODS: A total of 91 elementary school-age children underwent a cross-sectional assessment of body mass index, waist circumference, blood pressure and aerobic fitness. Healthy living knowledge and behaviours, including frequency of self-reported physical activity (PA) and dietary intake, were also evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 49.5% of children were obese/overweight and 31.9% had elevated blood pressure. The percentages having one, two or three cardiovascular risk factor(s) were 64.4%, 42.2% and 15.6%, respectively, with no significant difference between boys and girls. Overall, the students obtained higher mean scores in the areas of healthy PA, body image, self-esteem and nutritious beverage knowledge (89%, 85%, 79% and 71% of the maximum scores, respectively). The lowest scores were in nutritious food consumption and healthy PA frequency (46% and 56% of the maximum scores, respectively). On average, children consumed 2.7 L of sugar-sweetened beverages weekly and <2 servings of fruits or vegetables daily. Children spent approximately 2 h per day watching television, playing games or using a computer. CONCLUSION: There is an urgent need for community-based approaches to address the high rates of obesity and related cardiovascular risk factors among these Aboriginal children. Given the disconnect between healthy living knowledge and behaviour, it is important that future treatment programs address other barriers faced by Aboriginal populations living in rural and remote regions, including the high cost and limited access to high-quality nutritious foods and beverages, and limited access to indoor recreational programs over the long winter season. ©2014 Pulsus Group Inc.

The average age of the participants was 17.9±0.3 years, the average mass was 65.4±6.9 kg, and the average height was 169.6±6.9 cm. Time-motion analyses of the players were performed using Video Manual Motion Tracker 1.0 software. The descriptive approach of the study determined the overall physical activity (distance [m]) and type of locomotion (standing, walking, jogging, medium-intensity running, high-intensity running, sprinting). The players' heart rates were monitored using TEAM Polar2Pro sport testers (Polar Electro, Kempele, Finland). The maximum heart rate was measured by means of the Yo-Yo intermittent level 1 (YYIRT1) recovery test. One-way ANOVA with repeated- measures was used to compare data on heart rate, covered distance and speed. Based on the results from the time-motion analysis, the average distance covered was 113.3±8.6 m per minute per match. The average distance the players covered during the matches was 3399±362.3 m. The shortest distance (385.8±371.6 m), was traversed by standing and walking, and the longest distance (935.8±165.5 m) by jogging. The players' average heart rate was 183.7±7.3 beats·min-1. The mean intensity during the matches represented 89.6±3.6% of the maximal heart rate (HRmax). The results of this study demonstrate that handball is a high-intensity intermittent sport. The physiological profile shows that the players spent more than 83% of the playing time per match in the high-intensity zone (&gt;85%HRmax). Based on this, training focused on anaerobic exercises and interval training methods is recommended. Anaerobic training ensures that players will be ready to carry out a high intensity performance and to maintain it during the whole match. Maintaining high intensity depends chiefly on the ability to replenish energy systems during the period spent in lower-intensity locomotion. We recommend working on the improvements in anaerobic and aerobic power during practice sessions.",,"English; Croatian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84903757373

Engagement has been identified as a crucial component of learning in games research. However, the conceptualization and operationalization of engagement vary widely in the literature. Many valuable approaches illuminate ways in which presence, flow, arousal, participation, and other concepts constitute or contribute to engagement. However, few studies examine multiple conceptualizations of engagement in the same project.Method. This article discusses the results of two experiments that measure engagement in five different ways: survey self-report, content analyses of player videos, electro-dermal activity, mouse movements, and game click logs. We examine the relationships among these measures and assess how they are affected by the technical characteristics of a 30-minute, custom-built, educational game: use of a customized character, level of narrative complexity, and level of art complexity.Results. We found that the five measures of engagement correlated in limited ways, and that they revealed substantially different relationships with game characteristics. We conclude that engagement as a construct is more complex than is captured in any of these measures individually and that using multiple methods to assess engagement can illuminate aspects of engagement not detectable by a single method of measurement. © 2014 SAGE Publications.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84921455575

Compared with the 6MWT (1024.2±282.2mLm-1), Wii-Acti (1232.2±427.2mLm-1) and Wii-Train (1252.6±360.2mLm-1) reached higher VO2 levels during the last 3min (p&lt;0.0001 in both cases), while Wii-Fit (553.8±113.2mLm-1) reached significantly lower levels of VO2 (p&lt;0.001). Similar effects were seen for the ventilatory volume (VE). No differences in dyspnea and oxygen saturation were seen between the different modalities. All patients were compliant with all three Wii™ modalities. Conclusion: Active video game are well tolerated by patients with CF. All the modalities evaluated imposed a constant load but were associated with different physiological responses reflecting the different intensities imposed. Wii-Acti and Wii-Train impose a significantly high metabolic demand comparable to the 6MWT. Further research is needed to evaluate the effects of VGA as a training program to increase exercise capacity for CF patients. © 2014 European Cystic Fibrosis Society.",24935613,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84911961769

We sought to understand the dyadic effect of exclusion by kin (as opposed to non-kin strangers) on brain activity of the mother and her child and their subjective distress. To this end, we probed mother-child relationships with a computerized ball-toss game Cyberball. When excluded by one another, rather than by a stranger, both mothers and children exhibited a significantly pronounced frontal P2. Moreover, upon kin rejection versus stranger rejection, both mothers and children showed incremented left frontal positive slow waves for rejection events. Children reported more distress upon exclusion than their own mothers. Similar to past work, relatively augmented negative frontal slow wave activity predicted greater self-reported ostracism distress. This effect, generalized to the P2, was limited to mother- or child-rejection by kin, with comparable magnitude of effect across kin identity (mothers vs. children). For both mothers and children, the frontal P2 peak was significantly pronounced for kin rejection versus stranger rejection. Taken together, our results document the rapid categorization of social signals as kin relevant and the specificity of early and late neural markers for predicting felt ostracism. Kin rejection was examined by looking at neural responses in children and their mothers while playing the computer game Cyberball. Responses, specifically the frontal P2 and slow wave, were selectively greater for rejection by kin than by stranger. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",24909389,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84939252264

Depictions of fear, horror, amorality, evil and so on, have come to be associated with these sound worlds, particularly within the realm of popular culture. A number of game titles and franchises have emerged in recent years, which exploit these musical associations, exploring their creative potential as vehicles of fear and horror within the context of interactive game-play. Two composers associated with this approach are Jason Graves (Dead Space franchise) and Garry Schyman (Bioshock franchise, Dante’s Inferno). This article explores perceived links between avant-garde music (as defined in ‘populist’ rather than musicological or historical terms, as a ‘catch-all’ phrase for twentieth-century music exploiting experimental techniques, modernism and atonality) and depictions of horror and fear through interviews with Graves and Schyman. Further questions are posed to Paul Gorman (audio director – Dante’s Inferno) and Michael Kamper (audio director – Bioshock 2) to contextualize the discussion by demonstrating the significant creative influence of audio directors in guiding the musical approach taken by game composers. The article would be of potential interest to anyone with an interest in game audio, commercial composition/composers, game development, creative collaboration, audio direction and the power of music to manipulate the emotions in association with visual media. © 2014 Intellect Ltd Article.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925247869

OBJECTIVE To determine whether cognitive and/or emotional variables mediate the effect of violent video game play on aggression and whether the effect is moderated by age, sex, prior aggressiveness, or parental monitoring. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Three-year longitudinal panel study. A total of 3034 children and adolescents from 6 primary and 6 secondary schools in Singapore (73%male) were surveyed annually. Children were eligible for inclusion if they attended one of the 12 selected schools, 3 of which were boys' schools. At the beginning of the study, participants were in third, fourth, seventh, and eighth grades, with a mean (SD) age of 11.2 (2.1) years (range, 8-17 years). Study participation was 99% in year 1. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The final outcome measurewas aggressive behavior, with aggressive cognitions (normative beliefs about aggression, hostile attribution bias, aggressive fantasizing) and empathy as potential mediators. RESULTS Longitudinal latent growth curve modeling demonstrated that the effects of violent video game play are mediated primarily by aggressive cognitions. This effect is not moderated by sex, prior aggressiveness, or parental monitoring and is only slightly moderated by age, as younger children had a larger increase in initial aggressive cognition related to initial violent game play at the beginning of the study than older children. Model fit was excellent for all models. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Given that more than 90% of youths play video games, understanding the psychological mechanisms by which they can influence behaviors is important for parents and pediatricians and for designing interventions to enhance or mitigate the effects. © 2014 American Medical Association.",24663396,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84900402140

Six male amateur handball players took part in this study and participated in three different 8-min 3vs3 (plus goalkeepers) small-sided handball games (each repeated twice). The three court dimensions were 12×24m, 30×15m and 32×16m. Through Global Positioning System devices (SPI pro elite 15Hz, GPSports) and video analysis, the following parameters were recorded: cyclic and acyclic movements (distance covered and number of technical actions executed), heart rate, and rating of perceived exertion (RPE). Total distance travelled increased with court dimensions (885.2m ± 66.6m in 24×12m; 980.0m ± 73.4m in 30×15m; 1095.0m ± 112.9m in 32×16m, p &lt; 0.05). The analysis of distance covered in the four speed zones (0-1.4 m·s-1; 1.4-3.4 m·s-1; 3.4-5.2 m·s-1; &gt;5.2 m·s-1) highlighted substantial differences: playing with the 30×15m court in comparison to the 24×12m, the players covered less distance in the first speed zone (p = 0.012; ES = 0.70) and more distance in the second (p = 0.049; ES = 0.73) and third (p = 0.012; ES = 0.51) speed zones. Statistical differences were also found between the 24×12m and 32×16m courts: the players covered more distance in the second and third speed zones (p = 0.013, ES = 0.76; p = 0.023 ES = 0.69) with the 32×16m court in comparison to the 24×12m. There was no significant effect of court dimensions on the technical parameters (number of team actions, passes, piston movements toward goal and defensive activities), the number of specific handball jumps and changes of direction, and the time spent in the different heart rate zones. Considering the average data of all the experimental conditions together (24×12m, 30×15m, 32×16m), a pronounced statistical difference was highlighted between the values in first two HR zones and the last two (p &lt; 0.05; large ES). The rating of perceived exertion was significantly higher during the drill with the 32×16m court compared with the 24×12m one (p &lt; 0.05; ES = 2.34). Our findings indicate that changing court dimensions during small-sided handball games can be used to manipulate both external and internal loads on the players. © Journal of Sports Science and Medicine.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84901693326

The learning process, a very important feature of intelligent methods, is the result of an intelligent game controller to determine and control the game objects behaviors' or actions autonomously. Our approach is to use a more efficient learning model in the form of artificial neural networks for training the controllers. We propose a Hill-Climbing Neural Network (HillClimbNet) that controls the movement of the Ms. Pac-man agent to travel around the maze, gobble all of the pills and escape from the ghosts in the maze. HillClimbNet combines the hill-climbing strategy with a simple, feed-forward artificial neural network architecture. The aim of this study is to analyze the performance of various activation functions for the purpose of generating neural-based controllers to play a video game. Each non-linear activation function is applied identically for all the nodes in the network, namely log-sigmoid, logarithmic, hyperbolic tangent-sigmoid and Gaussian. In general, the results shows an optimum configuration is achieved by using log-sigmoid, while Gaussian is the worst activation function.©Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84893022545

This paper compares a vehicle-based paradigm (where a single operator individually assigns tasks to unmanned assets) to a task-based paradigm (where the operator generates a task list, which is then given to the group of vehicles that determine how to best divide the tasks among themselves.) The results demonstrate significant advantages in using a task-based paradigm for both overall performance and robustness to increased workload. This effort also demonstrated that while previous video gaming experience mattered for performance, the degree of experience that demonstrated benefit was minimal.

The children alternated between playing the collaborative video game with a neurotypical adult and playing the same game with the humanoid robot, being exposed to each condition twice. The equipment and experimental setup were designed to observe whether the children would engage in more collaborative behaviours while playing the video game and interacting with the adult than performing the same activities with the humanoid robot. The article describes the development of the experimental setup and its first evaluation in a small-scale exploratory pilot study. The purpose of the study was to gain experience with the operational limits of the robot as well as the dyadic video game, to determine what changes should be made to the systems, and to gain experience with analyzing the data from this study in order to conduct a more extensive evaluation in the future. Based on our observations of the childrens' experiences in playing the cooperative game, we determined that while the children enjoyed both playing the game and interacting with the robot, the game should be made simpler to play as well as more explicitly collaborative in its mechanics. Also, the robot should be more explicit in its speech as well as more structured in its interactions. Results show that the children found the activity to be more entertaining, appeared more engaged in playing, and displayed better collaborative behaviours with their partners (For the purposes of this article, 'partner' refers to the human/robotic agent which interacts with the children with autism. We are not using the term's other meanings that refer to specific relationships or emotional involvement between two individuals.) in the second sessions of playing with human adults than during their first sessions. One way of explaining these findings is that the children's intermediary play session with the humanoid robot impacted their subsequent play session with the human adult. However, another longer and more thorough study would have to be conducted in order to better re-interpret these findings. Furthermore, although the children with autism were more interested in and entertained by the robotic partner, the children showed more examples of collaborative play and cooperation while playing with the human adult. © 2013 The Author(s).",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84896306077

This challenging scientific perspective has produced a number of programming techniques often applied to solve concrete problems (Data Analysis, Process Optimization, Social Simulations, etc.). Computer Gaming is a field where AL techniques are applied. There are many successfully Alife products for pure entertainment (e.g., Tamagotchi and Creatures) and for educational objectives (e.g., Avida-Ed). However, we notice that all AL-Based games share a general flavor: they refer in someway to biological scenarios. In other terms, they represent often a sort of popularization of AL experiments designed for non-scientists. In this paper we argue that AL programming techniques (or more basically bio-inspired computational algorithms) could be used to develop generic games (e.g., sports, adventures, business games, etc.) without any relation with a biological perspective. We describe BreedBot and Learn2Lead, two Serious Games that we think could be paradigmatic examples about how to use AL techniques in different ways and fields that could be very different from their biological roots. BreedBot and its sequels (BestBot and BrianFarm) have been developed to disseminate the core-concepts of Autonomous Robotics and Learn2Lead has been developed to teach Psychological Theories of Teamwork in Small and Medium Enterprises. In BreedBot, AL techniques are used to develop the player–game interaction and they are explicitly visible by the user (he/she has to train/evolve a population of artificial agents). At the opposite side, Lear2lead has an old style appearance but it hides an AL engine. In this case AL techniques are used to model the game mechanics (e.g., artificial team dynamics and avatars’ behavior).

Our objective was to investigate the association between asthma diagnosis and physical activity and to examine differences in these associations by race/ethnicity, weight status and caregiver education. Methods: We investigated the association between asthma (defined as report of physician-diagnosed asthma with at least one asthma related symptom) and measures of physical and sedentary activity in a study of 6- to 8-year-old girls in the Breast Cancer and the Environment Research Project. We compared reported activity and pedometer measurements among girls with and without asthma, and examined modification of these associations by race/ethnicity, weight status and caregiver education. Results: Girls (n=1182) were included with 33.5% White, 4.8% Asian, 30.6% non Hispanic Black and 30.7% Hispanic. Asthma was present in 16.2% of girls. Overall, 38% of girls reported no participation in organized recreational activities and 58% had >2h/day of television, video game and computer time combined. Girls with asthma whose parents were less educated reported fewer pedometer steps and less non-scheduled activity than girls without asthma with similar caregiver education level. Among girls with asthma, those on a controller medication had higher levels of sedentary activity and more structured physical activity but were less likely to report high intensity physical activity. Conclusions: Among girls whose parents are less educated, girls with asthma may have lower physical activity levels than girls without asthma.

Affect-sensitive robots are more likely to be able to establish and maintain believable interactions over extended periods of time. Nevertheless, the integration of affect recognition frameworks in real-time human-robot interaction scenarios is still underexplored. In this article, we propose and evaluate a context-sensitive affect recognition framework for a robotic game companion for children. The robot can automatically detect affective states experienced by children in an interactive chess game scenario. The affect recognition framework is based on the automatic extraction of task features and social interaction-based features. Vision-based indicators of the children's nonverbal behaviour are merged with contextual features related to the game and the interaction and given as input to support vector machines to create a context-sensitive multimodal system for affect recognition. The affect recognition framework is fully integrated in an architecture for adaptive human-robot interaction. Experimental evaluation showed that children's affect can be successfully predicted using a combination of behavioural and contextual data related to the game and the interaction with the robot. It was found that contextual data alone can be used to successfully predict a subset of affective dimensions, such as interest toward the robot. Experiments also showed that engagement with the robot can be predicted using information about the user's valence, interest and anticipatory behaviour. These results provide evidence that social engagement can be modelled as a state consisting of affect and attention components in the context of the interaction. © 2014 ACM.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84983580321

A meta-CSP can be seen as a metaproblem whose decomposition leads to a set of CSPs. The meta-variables correspond to sub-problems of the original problem, and a meta-constraint is a relation among those meta-variables. Meta-CSPs find many applications in industry, usually in processes that involve time and actions such as the control of a robot, a manufacturing process, or the scheduling of any common activity. In this paper, we introduce the notion of Sequentially Dependent Meta-CSP (SD Meta-CSP), which extends the meta-CSP in order to support applications where a dependency between sub-problems is mandatory. In this case, the meta-CSP is decomposed into a set of sub-problems {Pi, Pi+1, . . . , Pn}, but the instance of the sub-problem Pi+1 sequentially depends on the solution of the sub-problem Pi . In this work we provide a formal definition for the SD Meta-CSPs, a framework to handle it, and we illustrate its applicability to video games.

Good balance control is closely related to body stability and its development. Therefore, balance training is necessary for any age group. OBJECTIVE: This study proposes the combination of Kinect and virtual reality to build an information platform of interactive scenarios, for practice and evaluation of balance ability. Real-time monitoring of SpO2, pulse rate, velocity and reaction time during the training process is presented for the training activities of elderly physical function. METHODS: Based on the indicators of balance ability, this information platform sets out various training activities to improve balance ability, making the supposedly tedious process fun and vivid and leading to much better training results. RESULTS: The data (SpO2, pulse rate, velocity, reaction time) collected from this platform can be sorted and analysed, and the results used to evaluate the performance of balance training, and referenced for follow-up planning in the future. The real-time pulse rate and SpO2 measurement information indicating the training activities for the elderly to maintain physical function has a positive significance. A noninvasive and unconstrained real-time method to detect the pulse rate and SpO2 during exercises is presented. The results of balance assessment scale testing of BBS and TUG for the experimental group show that effective balance really improved. The difference between the experimental group and the control group was achieved by using paired t-test. The data were analysed by the descriptive statistics on significant level of P &lt; 0.01. CONCLUSIONS: From the training results of the participants, we know that the information platform developed for enhancing balance ability is in line with practical needs. Furthermore, the fun and interesting game-like exercises it introduces are very helpful in improving balance ability, and certainly in preventing falls. © 2014 - IOS Press and the authors.",24361986,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84901836999

However, general-purpose computers are not designed with the millisecond-level accuracy of operation required for such applications. Software that does not control for the various sources of delay may return reaction time values that are substantially different from the true reaction times. We have developed and characterized a freely available system for PC-based simple visual reaction time testing that is analogous to the widely used psychomotor vigilance task (PVT). In addition, we have integrated individualized prediction algorithms for near-real-time neurobehavioral performance prediction. We characterized the precision and accuracy with which the system as a whole measures reaction times on a wide range of computer hardware configurations, comparing its performance with that of the ""gold standard"" PVT-192 device. We showed that the system is capable of measuring reaction times with an average delay of less than 10 ms, a margin of error that is comparable to that of the gold standard.

Match analysis is increasingly being used by sport scientists and coaches to improve the understanding of the physical demands of this sport. This study investigated the physical and physiological demands of elite men's rugby sevens, with special reference to the temporal patterns of fatigue during match play. Nine players, 4 backs and 5 forwards (age 25.1 6 3.1 years) participated during 2 ""Roma 7s"" international tournaments (2010 and 2011). All the players were at the professional level in the highest Italian rugby union, and 5 of these players also competed at the international level. During the matches (n = 15), the players were filmed to assess game performance. Global positioning system, heart rate (HR), and blood lactate (BLa) concentration data were measured and analyzed. The mean total distance covered throughout matches was 1,221 ± 118 m (first half = 643 ± 70 m and second half = 578 ± 77 m; with a decrease of 11.2%, p ≥ 0.05, Effect Size [ES] = 0.29). The players achieved 88.3 ± 4.2 and 87.7 ± 3.4% of the HRmax during the first and second halves, respectively. The BLa for the first and second halves was 3.9 ± 0.9 and 11.2 ± 1.4 mmol.L -1, respectively.

The difference found in relation to the playing position, although not statistically significant (p = 0.11), showed a large ES (n2 = 0.20), suggesting possible practical implications.

In particular, there is growing interest in intranasal OT as a potential treatment for certain psychiatric disorders, and preliminary pre-clinical and clinical studies suggest efficacy in alleviating some of the associated symptoms. However, the vast majority of research participants in these studies have been male, and there is evidence for sexually differentiated effects of nonapeptides in both humans and non-human animals. To date, no study has investigated the effect of intranasal OT on brain function in human males and females within the same paradigm. Previously, in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind fMRI study, we reported effects of intranasal OT and AVP on behavior and brain activity of human males as they played an interactive social game known as the Prisoner's Dilemma Game. Here, we present findings from an identical study in human females, and compare these with our findings from males. Overall, we find that both behavioral and neural responses to intranasal OT and AVP are highly sexually differentiated. In women, AVP increased conciliatory behavior, and both OT and AVP caused women to treat computer partners more like humans. In men, AVP increased reciprocation of cooperation from both human and computer partners. However, no specific drug effects on behavior were shared between men and women. During cooperative interactions, both OT and AVP increased brain activity in men within areas rich in OT and AVP receptors and in areas playing a key role in reward, social bonding, arousal and memory (e.g., the striatum, basal forebrain, insula, amygdala and hippocampus), whereas OT and AVP either had no effect or in some cases actually decreased brain activity in these regions in women. OT treatment rendered neural responses of males more similar to responses of females in the placebo group and vice versa, raising the prospect of an inverted u-shaped dose response to central OT levels. These findings emphasize the need to fully characterize the effects of intranasal OT and AVP in both males and females and at multiple doses before widespread clinical application will be warranted. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",24157401,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84888021826

I examined how social interactions influence associative learning in neurodegenerative diseases and atypical neurodevelopmental conditions primarily characterised by social cognitive and memory dysfunctions. Methods: Participants were individuals with high-functioning autism (HFA, n=18), early-stage behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD, n=16) and Alzheimer's disease (AD, n=20). The leading symptoms in HFA and bvFTD were social and behavioural dysfunctions, whereas AD was characterised by memory deficits. Participants received three versions of a paired associates learning task. In the game with boxes test, objects were hidden in six candy boxes placed in different locations on the computer screen. In the game with faces, each box was labelled by a photo of a person. In the real-life version of the game, participants played with real persons. Results: Individuals with HFA and bvFTD performed well in the computer games, but failed on the task including real persons. In contrast, in patients with early-stage AD, social interactions boosted paired associates learning up to the level of healthy control volunteers. Worse performance in the real life game was associated with less successful recognition of complex emotions and mental states in the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test.

Conclusions: When social cognition is impaired, but memory systems are less compromised (HFA and bvFTD), real-life interactions disrupt associative learning; when disease process impairs memory systems but social cognition is relatively intact (early-stage AD), social interactions have a beneficial effect on learning and memory. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",24709075,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84897544350

This AI is an autonomous computer program that governs the actions that one of the two players executes during the game according to the state of play. The entries are evaluated via a competition mechanism consisting of two-player rounds where each entry is tested against others. This paper describes the use of competitive coevolutionary (CC) algorithms for the automatic generation of winning game strategies in Planet Wars, the RTS game associated with the 2010 contest. Three different versions of a prime algorithm have been tested. Their common nexus is not only the use of a Hall-of-Fame (HoF) to keep note of the winners of past coevolutions but also the employment of an archive of experienced players, termed the hall-of-celebrities (HoC), that puts pressure on the optimization process and guides the search to increase the strength of the solutions; their differences come from the periodical updating of the HoF on the basis of quality and diversity metrics. The goal is to optimize the AI by means of a self-learning process guided by coevolutionary search and competitive evaluation. An empirical study on the performance of a number of variants of the proposed algorithms is described and a statistical analysis of the results is conducted. In addition to the attainment of competitive bots we also conclude that the incorporation of the HoC inside the primary algorithm helps to reduce the effects of cycling caused by the use of HoF in CC algorithms. © Springer Science+Business Media 2014.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84903582158

Compared to surgery and drug treatments, balance training is non-invasive and more desired. However, training exercises are usually tedious and the assessment tool is insufficient to diagnose patient's severity rapidly. Methods: An interactive virtual reality (VR) game-based rehabilitation program that adopted Cawthorne-Cooksey exercises, and a sensor-based measuring system were introduced. To verify the therapeutic effect, a clinical experiment with 48 patients and 36 normal subjects was conducted. Quantified balance indices were measured and analyzed by statistical tools and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Results: In terms of balance indices, patients who completed the training process are progressed and the difference between normal subjects and patients is obvious. Conclusions: Further analysis by SVM classifier show that the accuracy of recognizing the differences between patients and normal subject is feasible, and these results can be used to evaluate patients' severity and make rapid assessment. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",24894180,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84904471510

We aimed to investigate the prevalence of neck and shoulder pain in Norwegian adolescence and to examine whether behavioral and emotional factors were associated with the risk of neck and shoulder pain. Finally we aimed to investigate whether neck and shoulder pain was related to the use of health services. Method Data from the population-based study ung@hordaland were used. Participants were asked how often during the last 6 months they had experienced neck and shoulder pain. The association between frequent neck and shoulder pain and physical activity, symptoms of depression, and screen-based activities was evaluated using logistic regression analyses stratified by gender. The relative risk of visiting health services when reporting neck and shoulder pain was calculated using multiple logistic regression analyses. Results Frequent neck and shoulder pain was reported by 20.0% (1,797 of the total 8,990) and more often by girls than boys (p <.001). A high score of depressive symptoms was the strongest risk factor for neck and shoulder pain in both boys and girls (odds ratio = 6.14 [95% confidence interval 4.48-8.42] and odds ratio = 3.10 [95% confidence interval 2.63-3.67], respectively). Frequent screen-based activities slightly increased the risk while physical activity was protective. Individuals reporting neck and shoulder pain more often visited their general practitioner (47.1% vs. 31.8%) and school health services (24.6% vs. 13.5%). Conclusion Frequent neck and shoulder pain was reported in 20% of Norwegian adolescents. Symptoms of depression and screen-based activities increased the risk of neck and shoulder pain while physical activity was protective.

To make players care about these issues, we added a direct impact of the players' actions on a population of non-player characters, the villagers, whose simple autonomous behaviors resemble that of living entities. The game was implemented in the multi-user online three-dimensional (3-D) virtual world platform Open-Simulator, which supports an immersive user experience and high accessibility.

HCGs are different from games for pure entertainment which emphasize play and fun, rather than output generation. Therefore, research has yet to fully explore the factors underlying players' perception of HCG enjoyment. In this paper, we study the influence of motivational needs satisfaction and perceived output quality on perceived HCG enjoyment using a survey (N = 205) of a location-based information sharing HCG called SPLASH, developed as part of our research. According to the results, perceived needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness influence perceived enjoyment of HCGs, suggesting that HCGs that fulfill these three needs are more likely to be enjoyable, thereby encouraging players to make useful computations. The results also show that participants who perceive higher levels output relevancy report a greater level of enjoyment, indicating that HCGs that assist players in generating relevant outputs are more likely to be perceived as enjoyable. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Effects of these temperatures on player performance are well-documented; however, little is known how this environmental stress may impair cognitive performance of soccer referees and if so, whether exercise exasperates this. The present study aims to investigate the effect of cold [COLD; -5°C, 40% relative humidity (RH)], hot (HOT; 30°C, 40% RH) and temperate (CONT; 18°C, 40% RH) conditions on decision making during soccer specific exercise. On separate occasions within each condition, 13 physically active males; either semi-professional referees or semi-professional soccer players completed three 90 min intermittent treadmill protocols that simulated match play, interspersed with 4 computer delivered cognitive tests to measure vigilance and dual task capacity. Core and skin temperature, heart rate, rating of perceived exertion (RPE) and thermal sensation (TS) were recorded throughout the protocol. There was no significant difference between conditions for decision making in either the dual task (interaction effects: FALSE p = 0.46; MISSED p = 0.72; TRACKING p = 0.22) or vigilance assessments (interaction effects: FALSE p = 0.31; HIT p = 0.15; MISSED p = 0.17) despite significant differences in measured physiological variables (skin temperature: HOT vs. CONT 95% CI = 2.6 to 3.9, p < 0.001; HOT vs. COLD 95% CI = 6.6 to 9.0, p < 0.001; CONT vs. COLD 95% CI = 3.4 to 5.7, p < 0.01). It is hypothesized that the lack of difference observed in decision making ability between conditions was due to the exercise protocol used, as it may not have elicited an appropriate and valid soccer specific internal load to alter cognitive functioning. © 2014 Taylor, Fitch, Castle, Watkins, Aldous, Sculthorpe, Midgely, Brewer and Mauger.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84904339069

Using an unfamiliar language (German) to remove semantics, we assessed the role of meaning in promoting attention to content over prosody. As in a previous study with English sentences, TYP children attended to content to a greater extent than children with ASD while maintaining equivalent levels of discrimination based on prosody. However, in contrast to previous results, TYP children did not show a preference for enthusiastic over grouchy tone of voice, which suggests that the unfamiliar language rendered affective valence less salient.

Although decision-related emotions produce lingering effects on mental state, neuroscience research has generally focused on transient brain responses to positive or negative events, but ignored more sustained consequences of emotional episodes on subsequent brain states. We investigated how spontaneous brain activity and functional connectivity at rest are modulated by postdecision regret and gratification in 18 healthy human subjects using a gambling task in fMRI. Differences between obtained and unobtained outcomes were manipulated parametrically to evoke different levels of regret or gratification. We investigated how individual personality traits related to depression and rumination affected these responses. Medial and ventral prefrontal areas differentially responded to favorable and unfavorable outcomes during the gambling period. More critically, during subsequent rest, rostral anterior and posterior cingulate cortex, ventral striatum, and insula showed parametric response to the gratification level of preceding outcomes. Functional coupling of posterior cingulate with striatum and amygdala was also enhanced during rest after high gratification. Regret produced distinct changes in connectivity of subgenual cingulate with orbitofrontal cortex and thalamus. Interestingly, individual differences in depressive traits and ruminations correlated with activity of the striatum after gratification and orbitofrontal cortex after regret, respectively. By revealing lingering effects of decision-related emotions on key nodes of resting state networks, our findings illuminate how such emotions may influence self-reflective processing and subsequent behavioral adjustment, but also highlight the malleability of resting networks in emotional contexts. © 2014 the authors.",24899706,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84901809973

To improve adherence to exercise in HF patients, alternative approaches to motivate and increase self-efficacy to exercise are needed. Therefore, we have studied a new phenomenon: exergames (games to improve physical exercise). The aims of the study were to assess the influence of the exergame platform Nintendo Wii on exercise capacity and daily physical activity in heart failure patients, to study factors related to exercise capacity and daily physical activity, and to assess patients' adherence to exergaming. Methods: A 12-week pilot study with a pretest-posttest design was conducted. The intervention consisted of an instruction on how to use the Wii and 12 weeks' access to Wii at home. The main variables tested were exercise capacity (measured with a six-minute walking test), daily physical activity (measured with an activity monitor), and time exergaming (daily self-report with a diary). Bivariate correlations were used to assess associations between symptom experience, self-efficacy, motivation, anxiety, and depression. Results: In total, 32 heart failure patients were included. More than half of the patients (53%) significantly increased their exercise capacity after 12 weeks. No significant difference was found in daily physical activity between baseline and 12 weeks. Lower NYHA class and shorter time since diagnosis were factors significantly related to the increase in exercise capacity. The daily mean time spent exergaming was 28 minutes, and having grandchildren and being male were related to more time spent exergaming. Conclusion: Exergaming has the potential to increase exercise capacity in elderly, chronically ill cardiac patients. Although the daily physical activity did not change over time, exergaming was feasible for heart failure patients and might be a rehabilitation option for patients with heart failure. © 2014 Klompstra et al.",25407612,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84931839735

What are the neural processes that determine individual differences in the ability to cope with danger? We hypothesized that the extent of synchronization between amygdala, striatum, and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) would predict successful active coping performance. To test this, we developed a novel computer task based on the principals of Sidman avoidance. Healthy human participants learned through trial and error to move a marker between virtual game board compartments once every 3 s to avoid mild shocks. Behaviorally, participants exhibited large individual differences. Strikingly, both amygdala-mPFC and caudate-mPFC coupling during active coping trials covaried with final active coping performance across participants. These findings indicate that synchronization between mPFC subregions, and both amygdala and caudate predicts whether individuals will achieve successful active coping performance by the end of training. Thus, successful performance of adaptive actions in the face of threat requires functional synchronization of a neural circuit consisting of mPFC, striatum, and amygdala. Malfunction in the crosstalk between these components might underlie anxiety symptoms and impair individuals’ ability to actively cope under stress. This opens an array of possibilities for therapeutic targets for fear and anxiety disorders. © 2014 the authors.",25355225,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84908348781

To produce electricity in the smart grid, many micro grids (MGs) may exploit various renewable energy resources. Because the production capacity of renewable resources cannot be controlled, the MGs often require the power plants to provide power for them. However, the power loss between each MG and the power plant is larger than that among the MGs. To alleviate this power loss, we propose a game theoretic coalition formulation strategy for the MGs dubbed GT-CFS. Our proposed GT-CFS allows the MGs (belonging to the same macro station (MS)) to autonomously cooperate and self-organize into a partition composed of disjoint MG coalitions. Also, GT-CFS enables the MGs, in a distributed manner, to decide whether they will remain in the coalitions or not upon environmental changes, e.g., the variation of the power demand of the MGs. Within every coalition, MGs coordinate the power transfer among themselves as well as with the MS, in a fashion to optimize a utility function, which captures the total losses over the power distribution lines. MGs in the same coalition will distribute the extra profits (i.e., payoff) produced from forming coalitions by their 'Shapley value.' Through computer simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed GT-CFS reduces the average power loss per MG significantly in contrast with the conventional noncooperative approach. © 2013 IEEE.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84906082112

Given two points in a map, path-planning algorithms search for a path that joins those two points, avoiding obstacles. It is a challenging problem with important practical applications in a wide range of applications: autonomous mobile robotics, logistics or video games, just to mention some of them. Given its importance, it has attracted much research, resulting in a large number of algorithms, some classical, such as A∗, other more specialized, such as swarms. However, despite all the literature dedicated to this problem, the statistics used to analyze experimental results in most cases are naïve. In this paper, we position in favor of the need of incorporating stronger statistical methods in path-planning empirical research and promote a debate in the research community. To this end, we analyze some 2D-grid classical path-planning algorithms in discrete domains (i.e. A∗ and A∗ with post-processing) and more recent algorithms in continuous domains (i.e. Theta∗ and S-Theta∗). Given the differences of these algorithms, we study them under different criteria: Run-time, number of heading changes, number of expanded vertices and path-length. © The British Computer Society 2014.

The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is employed to describe and generate facial expressions. It breaks down facial actions into minor units known as Action Units (AUs). Facial expressions are generated by combining specific independent Action Units. The generated expressions cover sadness, anger, happy and fear.

In recent computer game and movies, simulation of natural phenomena has been increased. Realistic simulation is a key to the simulation of natural phenomena. It also comes in as an important role when simulating predator-prey chasing. Various factors must be put into consideration - such as physical condition, emotion of the predator, and the environment of the pursuit - when creating a realistic simulation of predator-prey chasing. It is not easy to simulate by reflecting all factors independently. Thus, this paper assumes that these independent variables are converted in terms of energy for the pursuit. It will simulate the situation of a predator chasing a prey using the ""energy for the pursuit"". To do this, we proposed the consumed energy by using steering force based on Newton's law and the needed energy based on physics theory for a predator to move a distance as maximum velocity. A number of experiments were conducted in order to show the correctness of the proposed energies.

'Near-miss' events, where unsuccessful outcomes are proximal to a jackpot win, recruit overlapping neural circuitry with actual monetary wins. Personal control over a gamble (e.g., via choice) is also known to increase confidence in one's chances of winning (the 'illusion of control'). Using psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses, we examined changes in functional connectivity as regular gamblers and non-gambling participants played a slot-machine game that delivered wins, near-misses and full-misses, and manipulated personal control. We focussed on connectivity with striatal seed regions, and associations with gambling severity, using voxel-wise regression. For the interaction term of near-misses (versus full-misses) by personal choice (participant-chosen versus computer-chosen), ventral striatal connectivity with the insula, bilaterally, was positively correlated with gambling severity. In addition, some effects for the contrast of wins compared to all non-wins were observed at an uncorrected (p <.001) threshold: there was an overall increase in connectivity between the striatal seeds and left orbitofrontal cortex and posterior insula, and a negative correlation for gambling severity with the connectivity between the right ventral striatal seed and left anterior cingulate cortex. These findings corroborate the 'non-categorical' nature of reward processing in gambling: near-misses and full-misses are objectively identical outcomes that are processed differentially. Ventral striatal connectivity with the insula correlated positively with gambling severity in the illusion of control contrast, which could be a risk factor for the cognitive distortions and loss-chasing that are characteristic of problem gambling. © 2014 The Authors.

Although there is evidence of substantial age-related deficits in memory for intentions, older adults have demonstrated the ability to compensate for their deficits in everyday life. The present study investigated feedback as a strategy for facilitating prospective memory in the elderly. Method: Young and older adults played a computer-based task, Virtual Week, in which they had to remember to carry out life-like intentions. After each virtual day, specific feedback on prospective memory performance was automatically provided on the computer screen that participants either proceeded through by themselves (non-social feedback) or were taken through by an experimenter (social feedback). The control group received no feedback. Results: We found that, compared with no-feedback group, only social feedback substantially reduced the age-related deficit in prospective memory. Older adults significantly benefited from feedback provided by the experimenter on the tasks of intermediate difficulty. Unexpectedly, prospective memory with non-social feedback was not only worse than with social feedback, but it was not any better than without any feedback at all. Conclusions: The results extended previous findings on the effectiveness of feedback in improving the memory performance of older adults to include memory for intentions. Despite the feedback meeting the critical recommendations of being specific, objective, and well-targeted, it was ineffective when the feedback displayed on the computer was not introduced by the experimenter. This has implications for computerized training tasks where automated feedback is considered crucial.

Neural correlates of reward processing seem to be influenced by developmental changes from adolescence to late adulthood. The aim of this study is to uncover these neural correlates during a slot machine gambling task across the lifespan. Therefore, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate 102 volunteers in three different age groups: 34 adolescents, 34 younger adults, and 34 older adults. We focused on the core reward areas ventral striatum (VS) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), the valence processing associated areas, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and insula, as well as information integration associated areas, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and inferior parietal lobule (IPL). Results showed that VS and VMPFC were characterized by a hyperactivation in adolescents compared with younger adults. Furthermore, the ACC and insula were characterized by a U-shape pattern (hypoactivation in younger adults compared with adolescents and older adults), whereas the DLPFC and IPL were characterized by a J-shaped form (hyperactivation in older adults compared with younger groups). Furthermore, a functional connectivity analysis revealed an elevated negative functional coupling between the inhibition-related area rIFG and VS in younger adults compared with adolescents. Results indicate that lifespan-related changes during reward anticipation are characterized by different trajectories in different reward network modules and support the hypothesis of an imbalance in maturation of striatal and prefrontal cortex in adolescents. Furthermore, these results suggest compensatory age-specific effects in fronto-parietal regions. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",24801222,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84923216886

These inferences can be drawn from several different sources of information occurring simultaneously in the communication situation. Based on previous studies revealing that children pay more heed to situational context than to emotional prosody when inferring the emotional states of others, we decided to focus on this issue, broadening the investigation to find out whether the natural combination of emotional prosody and faces (that is, paralinguistic cues) can overcome the dominance of situational context (that is, extralinguistic cues), and if so, at what age? In Experiment 1, children aged 3-9 years played a computer game in which they had to judge the emotional state of a character, based on two sources of information (that is, extralinguistic and paralinguistic) that were either congruent or conflicting. In Condition 1, situational context was compared with emotional prosody; in Condition 2, situational context was compared with emotional prosody combined with emotional faces. In a complementary study (Experiment 2) the same 3-year-olds performed recognition tasks with the three cues presented in isolation. Results highlighted the fundamental role of both cues, as a) situational context dominated prosody in all age groups, but b) the combination of emotional facial expression and prosody overcame this dominance, especially among the youngest and oldest children.

One common learning scenario that is often possible to apply is learning by imitation, in which the behavior of an exemplary driver provides training instances for a supervised learning algorithm. This article follows this approach in the domain of simulated car racing, using the TORCS simulator. In contrast to most prior work on imitation learning, a symbolic decision tree knowledge representation is adopted, which combines potentially high accuracy with human readability, an advantage that can be important in many applications. Decision trees are demonstrated to be capable of representing high quality control models, reaching the performance level of sophisticated pre-designed algorithms. This is achieved by enhancing the basic imitation learning scenario to include active retraining, automatically triggered on control failures. It is also demonstrated how better stability and generalization can be achieved by sacrificing human-readability and using decision tree model ensembles. The methodology for learning control models contributed by this article can be hopefully applied to solve real-world control tasks, as well as to develop video game bots. © 2014 by Paweł Cichosz.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84907810797

We conducted a 3 wk, 9-session clinical pilot with 10 people with chronic hemiparetic stroke, randomly assigned to train with an impedance- controlled ankle robot (anklebot) under either high reward (HR) or low reward conditions.

Assessments included paretic ankle motor control, learning curves, electroencephalograpy (EEG) coherence and spectral power during unassisted trials, and gait function.

However, the problem is to guide the robot though the trajectory and know whether it has followed it accurately to confirm that the qualified procedure has been carried out.Design/methodology/approach - The approach is to use sophisticated bulk electronics developed for game playing in combination with MATLAB to develop a wireless positioning system.Findings - The paper describes the development of an inexpensive wireless system comprising an optical spatial positioning system and inertial measurement unit that relates the 3D location of an NDT probe carried by a mobile robot to a computer-aided drawing (CAD) representation of the test structure in a MATLAB environment. The probe is located to an accuracy of - 2 mm at distances of 5 m.Research limitations/implications - Positioning range is limited to 5 m. Further development is required to increase this range.Practical implications - The wireless system is used to develop tools to guide the robot remotely to follow a desired scanning trajectory, obtain feedback about the actual trajectory executed by the robot, know exactly where an ultrasound pulse echo was captured, map identified defects on the CAD and relate them to the real test object.Originality/value - An inexpensive spatial positioning system with sufficient accuracy for automated NDT purposes. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84918524264

One such value is the opportunity to choose freely among many options, often regarded as a fundamental right to economic freedom. In modern developed societies, equal opportunities in work, living, and lifestyle are enforced by antidiscrimination laws. Despite the widespread endorsement of equal opportunity, no studies have explored how people assign value to it. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify the neural substrates for subjective valuation of equality in choice opportunity. Participants performed a two-person choice task in which the number of choices available was varied across trials independently of choice outcomes. By using this procedure, we manipulated the degree of equality in choice opportunity between players and dissociated it from the value of reward outcomes and their equality. We found that activation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) tracked the degree to which the number of options between the two players was equal. In contrast, activation in the ventral striatum tracked the number of options available to participants themselves but not the equality between players. Our results demonstrate that the vmPFC, a key brain region previously implicated in the processing of social values, is also involved in valuation of equality in choice opportunity between individuals. These findings may provide valuable insight into the human ability to value equal opportunity, a characteristic long emphasized in politics, economics, and philosophy. © 2014 the authors.",24790211,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84899625433

Robust detection of a laser spot has been made possible with the help of the computer vision techniques. Autonomous laser spot detection system has led to the evolution of many applications such as laser pointer interaction, autonomous robotic helper and simulation based computer game. This paper aims to provide the general architecture and methodology used in a laser spot detection system. Major lower level processing methods, such as thresholding, background subtraction, region of interest extraction and coordinate mapping are fundamental in developing a good laser spot system. Our study found out that most of existing systems are prone to error whenever the lighting condition is varied either gradually or suddenly. The spot is also difficult to detect when it is overlaid on a white background due to the weakness in the detection scheme. Jitter, which is mostly caused by uneven hand movement, is a big challenge in developing an accurate system, especially for laser interaction applications. Finally, we believe that a robust laser spot detection system can be built if the aforementioned challenges are carefully addressed. © 2005 - 2014 JATIT & LLS.

On average, the adaptive strategy achieves a higher payoff than other strategies. The strength of a strategy is defined as an adaptive measure calculated on the basis of a payoff obtained through interactions among agents. An agent interacts with other agents by selecting various strategies in computer networks. For the adaptive strategy, we give a formal definition of the adaptive measure of how well it behaves against other strategies. In order to demonstrate a performance of the adaptive strategy, we present a calculation example of the adaptive measure for the iterated prisoner's dilemma with three simple strategies. In the examplee, Trigger strategy is found to be the best strategy when we evaluate it by the adaptive measure, even if All-D (always defect) strategy achieves the highest expected payoff. Furthermore, we investigate the adaptive strategies for a self-repairing network consisting of agents with spatial strategies. According to simulations, under some conditions, the strategies obtaining the highest adaptive measures do not correspond to those with the highest averaged resources. The significance of the adaptive strategies is considered with a statistical analysis. The adaptive measure enables us to evaluate the behaviors of the adaptive strategies against those of other strategies. In addition, we discuss some open problems for polishing a notion of the adaptive strategies. © 2014.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84898626702

Artificial resin teeth are widely used for removable dental prostheses because of their excellent properties. An evaluation of their wear behavior is important for predicting good clinical performance.Purpose. The purpose of the study was to examine the wear behavior of 7 different artificial resin teeth with 3-dimensional measurements.Material and methods. The artificial denture teeth tested were 2 composite resin teeth (Yamahachi PX, Huge Kaijing), 3 cross-linked acrylic resin teeth (Cosmo HXL, Premium 8, Vita Lingoform), and 2 conventional acrylic resin teeth (Yamahachi FX, Shengjian). The specimens were subjected to an abrasive tester for masticatory simulation. The wear loss (vertical loss and volume loss) was determined with a confocal laser scanning microscope. Data were analyzed with 1-way ANOVA followed by the Games-Howell post hoc test (α=.05).Results. The mean vertical loss and volume loss for all cross-linked acrylic resin teeth (0.987-1.03 μm, 0.858-0.939 mm3 × 10-3) were higher than for all composite resin teeth (0.636-0.698 μm, 0.507-0.650 mm3 × 10-3, P&lt;.001) but lower than those for conventional acrylic resin teeth Yamahachi FX and Shengjian (1.39 μm, 1.24 mm3 × 10-3; 12.1 μm, 16.4 mm3 × 10-3; P&lt;.001). No significant differences for wear loss were found between the Vita Lingoform group and the other cross-linked acrylic resin teeth (P&gt;.05).Conclusion. The wear behavior of the artificial teeth examined differed with regard to their compositions. The composite resin teeth and high cross-linked acrylic resin teeth found superior wear resistance over the conventional acrylic resin teeth. © 2014 Editorial Council for the Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry.",24993378,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84912074716

It requires not only finding spatial curves but also that dynamic properties of the vehicles (such as speed limits for certain maneuvers) must be followed. In this paper, we present an approach for augmenting existing path planning methods to support basic dynamic constraints, concretely speed limit constraints. We apply this approach to the well known Astate-of-the-art ThetaLazy Thetapath planning algorithms. We use a concept of trajectory planning based on a modular architecture in which spatial and dynamic parts can be easily implemented. This concept allows dynamic aspects to be processed during planning. Existing systems based on a similar concept usually add dynamics (velocity) into spatial curves in a post-processing step which might be inappropriate when the curves do not follow the dynamics. Many existing trajectory planning approaches, especially in mobile robotics, encode dynamic aspects directly in the representation (e.g. in the form of regular lattices) which requires a precise knowledge of the environmental and dynamic properties of particular autonomous entities making designing and implementing such trajectory planning approaches quite difficult. The concept of trajectory planning we implemented might not be as precise but the modular architecture makes the design and implementation easier because we can use (modified) well known path planning methods and define models of dynamics of autonomous entities separately. This seems to be appropriate for simulations used in feasibility studies for some complex autonomous systems or in computer games etc. Our basic implementation of the augmented A, ThetaLazy Thetaalgorithms is also experimentally evaluated. We compare (i) the augmented and basic A, ThetaLazy Thetaalgorithms and (ii) optimizing of augmented ThetaLazy Thetafor distance (the trajectory length) and duration (time needed to move through the trajectory). © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84905562337

Moreover, we show that recognizing a face from a non-face can be accomplished autonomously if we imagine that learning to recognize a face occurs after learning to recognize a facial expression, and not the opposite, as it is classically considered. In these experiments, the robot is considered as a baby because we want to understand how the baby can develop some abilities autonomously. We model, test and analyze cognitive abilities through robotic experiments. Our starting point was a mathematical model showing that, if the baby uses a sensory motor architecture for the recognition of a facial expression, then the parents must imitate the baby’s facial expression to allow the online learning. Here, a first series of robotic experiments shows that a simple neural network model can control a robot head and can learn online to recognize the facial expressions of the human partner if he/she imitates the robot’s prototypical facial expressions (the system is not using a model of the face nor a framing system). A second architecture using the rhythm of the interaction first allows a robust learning of the facial expressions without face tracking and next performs the learning involved in face recognition. Our more striking conclusion is that, for infants, learning to recognize a face could be more complex than recognizing a facial expression. Consequently, we emphasize the importance of the emotional resonance as a mechanism to ensure the dynamical coupling between individuals, allowing the learning of increasingly complex tasks. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84919922196

We assess the prototype game regarding motivation to play and game usability, and also participants' emotional recognition abilities and technology usage. People with autism are less likely to gaze at faces and are also impaired in face discrimination tasks. Recently, technology plays an active role in helping these individuals to understand emotions and recognise facial expressions. LIFEisGAME prototype was played during a 15 minute game session by 11 children with ASD, with ages varying from 5-15 years old (M=9.27, SD=2.97), 91% were male and 9% were female, 82% were verbal ASD and 18% were non-verbal ASD. We video recorded each child and the footage was analysed according to game usability and motivation to play. Parents (n=11) filled out a parental consent form and a questionnaire about their child's technology usage and their emotional understanding. Therapists' opinions (n=8) about the game were given during an unstructured interview. The game was presented on an Ipad 4 (9.7 inches, 2048×1536). Participants enjoyed the prototype but it still needs to be simplified. All participants had experience with computer games. Fear, disgust and surprise were the most challenging emotions to recognise. Parents suggested adding musical stimuli to promote motivation and therapists recommended to include visual game instructions. Technology is a useful resource for autism and LIFEisGAME utilises technology to promote emotional understanding, bringing positive outcomes to quality of life for children with autism.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84894823296

Stronger activation to winning was observed in ventral and dorsal striatum as well as in vmPFC. Activation in ventral striatum was associated with participants' self-ratings of pleasure. During winning, ventral striatum showed stronger functional coupling with right insula, and weaker coupling with dorsal striatum, sensorimotor pre- and postcentral gyri, and visual association cortices.

The challenge in this case is to ensure children's comprehension of the game and to adequately combine feedback on the application with teacher interventions.

In this paper, we introduce a large data corpus derived from 58 participants that play the popular Super Mario Bros platform game and attempt to create accurate models of player experience for this game genre. Within the view of the current research, features extracted both from player gameplay behavior and game levels, and player visual characteristics have been used as potential indicators of reported affect expressed as pairwise preferences between different game sessions. Using neuroevolutionary preference learning and automatic feature selection, highly accurate models of reported engagement, frustration, and challenge are constructed (model accuracies reach 91%, 92%, and 88% for engagement, frustration, and challenge, respectively). As a step further, the derived player experience models can be used to personalize the game level to desired levels of engagement, frustration, and challenge as game content is mapped to player experience through the behavioral and expressivity patterns of each player. © 2013 IEEE.",24273140,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84890081139

However, like other body-based inputs such as gesture or gaze based systems, the system recognition of input commands is still far from perfect. This raises important questions, such as what level of control should such an interface be able to provide. What is the relationship between actual and perceived control? And in the case of applications for entertainment in which fun is an important part of user experience, should we even aim for the highest level of control, or is the optimum elsewhere? In this paper, we evaluate whether we can modulate the amount of control and if a game can be fun with less than perfect control. In the experiment users (n=158) played a simple game in which a hamster has to be guided to the exit of a maze. The amount of control the user has over the hamster is varied. The variation of control through confusion matrices makes it possible to simulate the experience of using a BCI, while using the traditional keyboard for input. After each session the user completed a short questionnaire on user experience and perceived control. Analysis of the data showed that the perceived control of the user could largely be explained by the amount of control in the respective session. As expected, user frustration decreases with increasing control. Moreover, the results indicate that the relation between fun and control is not linear. Although at lower levels of control fun does increase with improved control, the level of fun drops just before perfect control is reached (with an optimum around 96%). This poses new insights for developers of games who want to incorporate some form of BCI or other modality with unreliable input in their game: for creating a fun game, unreliable input can be used to create a challenge for the user. © 2013 IEEE.",24108725,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84890056328

The present study examined the impact of social exclusion compared to inclusion on steroid hormone concentrations as well as on subjective affect ratings. Methods: Eighty subjects (40 females) participated in two independent behavioral experiments. They engaged in a computerized ball tossing game in which they ostensibly played with two other players who deliberately excluded or included them, respectively. Hormone samples as well as mood ratings were taken before and after the game. Results: Social exclusion led to a decrease in positive mood ratings and increased anger ratings. In contrast, social inclusion did not affect positive mood ratings, but decreased sadness ratings. Both conditions did not affect cortisol levels. Testosterone significantly decreased after being excluded in both genders, and increased after inclusion, but only in males. Interestingly, progesterone showed an increase after both conditions only in females. Discussion: Our results suggest that social exclusion does not trigger a classical stress response but gender-specific changes in sex hormone levels. The testosterone decrease after being excluded in both genders, as well as the increase after inclusion in males can be interpreted within the framework of the biosocial status hypothesis. The progesterone increase might reflect a generalized affiliative response during social interaction in females. © 2013 The Authors.",23972943,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84888306197

It implements a shared-memory-based data transport protocol for message delivery and a TCP-based system management protocol. The latter ensures that the integrity of system structure is maintained at runtime. With the inclusion of bridging modules, the HCI2 Framework is interoperable with other software frameworks including Psyclone and ActiveMQ. In addition to the core communication middleware, we also present the integrated development environment (IDE) of the HCI2 Framework. It provides a complete graphical environment to support every step in a typical MHCI system development process, including module development, debugging, packaging, and management, as well as the whole system management and testing. The quantitative evaluation indicates that our framework outperforms other similar tools in terms of average message latency and maximum data throughput under a typical single PC scenario. To demonstrate HCI2 Framework's capabilities in integrating heterogeneous modules, we present several example modules working with a variety of hardware and software.

This approach works in two phases-a construction phase and a query phase.

In the query phase, a path is determined between a given starting point and a goal inside the corridor.

The classic framing effect was observed: participants chose the safe option when it was described as a potential gain, but they avoided the same option when it was described as a potential loss.

These effects were found to be related to self-reported social presence: linkage in positive emotional expression was associated with self-reported shared negative feelings. The observed effects confirmed the hypothesis that the social context affected the degree to which participants had similar reactions to their environment and consequently showed similar patterns of brain activity. We discuss the functional resemblance between linkage, as an indicator of a shared physiology and affect, and the well-known mirror neuron system, and how they relate to social functions like empathy. © 2013 Spapé et al.",24278112,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84894267868

For these applications it is essential that users appraise the affective qualities of the VE similar to those of its real world counterpart. Previous studies have shown that factors like simulated lighting, sound and dynamic elements all contribute to the affective appraisal of a desktop VE. Since ambient odor is known to affect the affective appraisal of real environments, and has been shown to increase the sense of presence in immersive VEs, it may also be an effective tool to tune the affective appraisal of desktop VEs. This study investigated if exposure to ambient odor can modulate the affective appraisal of a desktop VE with signs of public disorder. Method: Participants explored a desktop VE representing a suburban neighborhood with signs of public disorder (neglect, vandalism and crime), while being exposed to either room air or subliminal levels of unpleasant (tar) or pleasant (cut grass) ambient odor. Whenever they encountered signs of disorder they reported their safety related concerns and associated affective feelings. Results: Signs of crime in the desktop VE were associated with negative affective feelings and concerns for personal safety and personal property. However, there was no significant difference between reported safety related concerns and affective connotations in the control (no-odor) and in each of the two ambient odor conditions. Conclusion: Ambient odor did not affect safety related concerns and affective connotations associated with signs of disorder in the desktop VE. Thus, semantic congruency between ambient odor and a desktop VE may not be sufficient to influence its affective appraisal, and a more realistic simulation in which simulated objects appear to emit scents may be required to achieve this goal. © 2013 Toet et al.",24250810,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84892619918

Purpose: To compare the physical, physiological, and tactical demands of seasonal and tournament basketball competition and determine the pattern of changes within an international tournament. Methods: Eight elite junior male basketball players (age 17.8 ± 0.2 y, height 1.93 ± 0.07 m, mass 85 ± 3 kg; mean ± SD) were monitored in 6 seasonal games played over 4 mo in an Australian second-division national league and in 7 games of an international under-18 tournament played over 8 days. Movement patterns and tactical elements were coded from video and heart rates recorded by telemetry. Results: The frequency of running, sprinting, and shuffling movements in seasonal games was higher than in tournament games by 8-15% (99% confidence limits ± ~8%). Within the tournament, jogging and low- to medium-intensity shuffling decreased by 15-20% (± ∼14%) over the 7 games, while running, sprinting, and high-intensity shuffling increased 11-81% (± ∼25%). There were unclear differences in mean and peak heart rates. The total number of possessions was higher in seasonal than in tournament games by 8% (± 10%). Conclusions: Coaches should consider a stronger emphasis on strength and power training in their conditioning programs to account for the higher activity of seasonal games. For tournament competition, strategies that build a sufficient aerobic capacity and neuromuscular resilience to maintain high-intensity movements need to be employed. A focus on half-court tactics accounts for the lower number of possessions in tournaments. © 2013 Human Kinetics, Inc.",23479394,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84889605615

We further investigated if cognitive capacity and motor impairment influenced game performance. Nineteen children with neurological gait disorders (mean age: 13.4y, 42% girls) participated. To quantify game participation, electromyographic muscle activity (M. rectus femoris) and heart rate were compared in a demanding part and a less demanding part of the game. Cognitive capacity was assessed with the Test of Nonverbal Intelligence (TONI-4). Furthermore, the Functional Independence Measure for Children (WeeFIM), Manual Muscle Tests and a therapist-derived score of how well the child was able to train were assessed. Results showed that muscle activity and heart rate were higher during the demanding part of the game (30.7. ±. 22.6. μV; 129.4. ±. 15.7. bpm) compared to the less demanding part (16.0. ±. 13.4. μV; 124.1. ±. 15.9. bpm; p<. 0.01 for both measures). Game performance correlated moderately with the TONI-4 (r= 0.50, p = 0.04) and the cognition subscale of the WeeFIM (ρ= 0.59, p= 0.01). The therapist-derived score correlated significantly with game performance (p= 0.75, p<. 0.01) and the ability to modify muscle activity to the demands of the game (p= -0.72, p<. 0.01). Receiver operating characteristic analyses revealed that the latter factor differentiated well between those children suitable for the game and those not. We conclude that children with neurological gait disorders are able to modify their activity to the demands of the VR-scenario. However, cognitive function and motor impairment determine to which extent.

We compared cooperative decisions and electroencephalograph data between genders from who participated in repeated rounds of the public goods game (PGG) and investigated within groups changes that occurred after watching a TV program known as ""investigative reporting"" that denounces unfair advantages taken by free-riders against the public. Women tended to be more cooperative than men during early rounds of PGG, mostly because they react differently to the defection of others; women also had greater β and γ band activity in regions estimated to be associated with social cognition. These gender differences disappeared after participants watched the TV programs: women were more likely to choose free-riding in response to the defection of others that elicits significant increases in γ band activities that were estimated to be right insula. Greater activity in social cognition leads women to make decisions considering the motives of others, while men tend to make a decision by complying with the social norm.

In this study, the authors propose a runtime distributed migration algorithm based on game theory to balance the heat dissipation among processing elements (PEs) in a 3D NoC chip multiprocessor. The objective of this algorithm is to minimise the 3D NoC system's peak temperature, as well as the overhead imposed on chip performance during migration. Owing to the high thermal correlation between adjacent PEs in the same stack in 3D NoCs, the authors model this multi-objective problem as a cooperative game. The simulation results indicate upto 23 and 27% decrease in peak temperature, for the benchmarks that have the highest communication rate and the largest number of tasks, respectively.

Identifying the affective states that students experience in technology-enhanced learning contexts is a fundamental question in this area. This article provides an initial attempt to answer this question with a selective meta-analysis of 24 studies that utilized a mixture of methodologies (online self-reports, online observations, emote-aloud protocols, cued recall) and affect judges (students themselves, untrained peers, trained judges) for fine-grained monitoring of 14 discrete affective states of 1,740 middle school, high school, college, and adult students in 5 countries. Affective states occurred over the course of interactions with a range of learning technologies, including intelligent tutoring systems, serious games, simulation environments, and simple computer interfaces. Standardized effect sizes of relative frequency, computed by comparing the proportional occurrence of each affective state to the other states in each study, were modeled with random-effects models. Engagement/flow was consistently found to be relatively frequent (d+ = 2.5), and contempt, anger, disgust, sadness, anxiety, delight, fear, and surprise were consistently infrequent, with d+ ranging from -6.5 to -0.78. Effects for boredom (d+ = 0.19), confusion (d+ = 0.12), curiosity (d+ = -0.10), happiness (d+ = -0.13), and frustration (d+ = -2.5) varied substantially across studies. Mixed-effects models indicated that the source of the affect judgments (self vs. observers) and the authenticity of the learning contexts (classroom vs. laboratory) accounted for greater heterogeneity than the use of advanced learning technologies and training time.

The purpose of this study was to examine levels of physical activity (PA) and screen time (ST) in metabolically healthy obese (MHO) and metabolically unhealthy obese (MUO) adolescents and adults. Methods. NHANES data from obese adolescents (12-18 years, BMI z-score ≥ 95th percentile) and adults (19-85 years, BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) were pooled from 2003-2005 cycles. Metabolic phenotypes were categorized as MHO (0 or 1 cardiometabolic risk factor; triglycerides, HDL-C, blood pressure, or glucose) or MUO (≥2 cardiometabolic risk factors). Logistic regression models estimated associations between phenotype and PA/ST adjusted for age, gender, BMI, race/ethnicity, menopausal status, and NHANES cycle. Results. Among adolescents, PA was not associated with MHO. In contrast, MHO adults 19-44 years were 85% more likely to engage in active transportation and 2.7 times more likely to be involved in light intensity usual daily activity versus sitting. For each minute per day, adults 45-85 years were 36% more likely to have the MHO phenotype with higher levels of moderate PA. ST was not associated with metabolic phenotypes in adolescents or adults. Conclusion. The current study provides evidence that PA, but not ST, differs between MHO and MUO in adults, but not in adolescents. Future studies are needed to confirm results. © 2013 Sarah M.

Various studies are designed to monitor the CVR and use different types of experimental stressors. We have compared the CVR to three different stressors used in CVR based studies (cold pressor task, hand grip test, and video game) to identify the best suited stressor for any study design. Material and Methods: The study was conducted on 82 (38 female) young Indian adults with normal resting basal parameters and normotensive parents. Each volunteer was subjected to three stressors: cold pressor task (CPT), hand grip test (HGT), and video game (VG). The CVR to the three stressors was compared amongst female subjects and amongst male subjects by ANOVA, and between female and male subjects by unpaired Student's t-test. Results: Maximum CVR was obtained to HGT, while maximum gender difference in CVR was obtained in case of CPT. Heart rate and blood pressure changes obtained on playing VG were not statistically significant. Conclusion: When the purpose of research is to generate maximum possible CVR, we suggest the use of HGT; while if the purpose of the research is to study gender related differences, the use of CPT would be more appropriate. Unlike young adults of Western countries, VG is not perceived as a challenging task or stressor by young Indian adults and produces little change in heart rate and blood pressure.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84885197802

More importantly, testosterone reactivity to competition mediated the effect of winning on subsequent aggressive behaviour in men, but not women. We discuss limitations of the current study (e.g., the status manipulation may have affected other variables not measured in the study including competitiveness and physical activity expended), as well as discuss a potential neural mechanism underlying the effect of testosterone reactivity on aggressive behaviour. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",23587440,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84883866948

Here, we investigated the effect of damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC)-a brain region critical for valuing social information-on individuals' decisions in a trust game and in a risk game. In the trust game, one player, the investor, is endowed with a sum of money, which she can keep or invest. The amount she decides to invest is tripled and sent to the other player, the trustee, who then decides what fraction to return to the investor. In separate runs, ten patients with focal bilateral damage to the vmPFC and control participants made decision while playing in the role of either investor or trustee with different anonymous counterparts in each run. A risk game was also included in which the investor faced exactly the same decisions as in the trust game, but a random device (i.e., a computer), not another player, determined the final payoffs. Results showed that vmPFC patients' investments were not modulated by the type of opponent player (e.g., human vs. computer) present in the environment. Thus, vmPFC patients showed comparable risk-taking preferences both in social (trust game) and nonsocial (risk game) contexts. In stark contrast, control participants were less willing to take risk and invest when they believed that they were interacting with people than a computer. Furthermore, when acted as trustee, vmPFC patients made lower back transfers toward investors, thereby showing less reciprocity behavior. Taken together, these results indicate that social valuation and emotion subserved by vmPFC have a critical role in trusting and reciprocity decisions. The present findings support the hypothesis that vmPFC damage may impair affective systems specifically designed for mediating social transaction with other individuals. © 2013 Moretto, Sellitto and Di Pellegrino.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84884677021

For our study, we gathered data using questionnaires as well as by logging vehicle dynamics, environmental conditions, video data, and users' psychophysiological measurements. For the analysis, we used several novel approaches such as scatter plots to visualize driving tasks of different contexts and to obtain vigilance estimators from electroencephalographic (EEG) data in order to obtain important results about the differences between the driving in the two contexts.

Since human moving trajectory is one of the most informative representations for content understanding and event detection, trajectory-based video analysis has been gaining popularity. However, a jump action typically leads to violent change in human moving trajectory, since the person suddenly leaves the original plane on which he/she has been moving. The abnormal tracks of the trajectory would influence the performance of trajectory-based video analysis. Hence, differentiating jump tracks from planar moving tracks is of vital importance, not to mention that jump actions typically imply significant events, especially in sports games. In this paper, volleyball videos are used as case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed jump pattern recognition approach. We derive player trajectory by head tracking, analyze the movement of each player, and recognize potential jump tracks in player trajectories based on two important characteristics: (1) jumps cause pulse-like tracks in the trajectory and (2) the extensions of such tracks go through the vanishing point of vertical lines in the scenes. Finally, the jump positions/heights are estimated, in addition to the planar moving trajectory of each player on the court ground. The experiments show that satisfactory results can be obtained with the proposed recognition scheme. © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84883550223

In order to plan the most appropriate intervention mea sures the first step is to identify the associated factors of obesity. This paper presents the results of research conducted/coordinated by our research team and promo - ted by the Spanish Food Safety Agency (AESAN), in the last five years. These studies were focussed on representative samples of the Spanish population, paying attention to the condition of overweight/obesity and their associated factors. The first study, FANPE (""Fuentes alimentarias de nu - trientes de la población española"") (2009), was centered in 418 adults (18-60 years) from 15 provinces (30 sam - pling points). Its aim was to analyze the dietary sources of nutrients, paying particular attention to sodium. This research showed that the risk of overweight/obesity in - crea ses with age, in people who have follow weight con - trol diets, in ex-smokers, married people and those who slept less than 8.5 hours per day, while the risk is lower in women, people who make sport and those with an University degree. It was also found that overweight people had higher sodium intake and urine excretion. Therefore, and having in mind that 88.2% of the subjects took more than 2 g/day of sodium (the maximum recommended), it is advised to lower the sodium intake not only from the health point of view but also as a probably strategy against obesity. The study ALADINO (Estudio de Alimentación, Acti - vidad física, Desarrollo Infantil y Obesidad- Study of the Diet, Physical Activity, Child Development and Obesity) (2010-2011) was focused on 7659 children (6-9 years) from 19 autonomous communities. We founded a higher percentage of overweight/obesity in boys than in girls, and a significant increase in the figures from the age of 7. Being overweight is more evident in offspring of parents with low educational level or low income, or if parents are smokers (especially when both parents smoke). The pro - blem increases in those children who skip breakfast, have in those with sports facilities far from their home, those who have a personal computer, video game or TV in their room, or those who sleep less than 8 hours per day. All these factors, either by themselves or because they influence eating habits and/or activity patterns, are associated with a higher risk of being overweight, so it must be monitored and modified in a more favourable direction, within the health policies of each country, as part of stra - tegies to halt the rise in obesity condition.",24010744,"English; Spanish",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84883144010

Several brain centers of autonomic control and interoception that are activated in empathy are thought to misfunction in alexithymia. We hypothesized that individual differences in autonomic changes under affective stimulation might be associated with differences in alexithymia and empathy. METHODS:: We studied 21 healthy volunteers, comparing their alexithymia and empathy scores with changes in their sympathetic autonomic arousal, indexed by the palmar skin potential level, during 3 tasks: playing a computer game, performing mental arithmetic, and watching a negative emotional valence video. RESULTS:: Both autonomic and subjective sense of arousal increased at the beginning of each task and then gradually subsided over the course of the task. Higher autonomic arousal at the onset of the computer game was associated with higher empathy scores, and at the onset of the negative video with higher scores for both empathy and alexithymia. Alexithymia delayed the habituation of autonomic arousal during the computer game, while the empathy score was related to a faster decline in arousal during the negative video task. CONCLUSIONS:: High alexithymia and high empathy scores were linked to increased autonomic arousal at the onset of emotional stimulation, but were distinguishable in the rates of habituation of the evoked arousal. Our data provide insight into the relationships among interacting psychological traits, physiologic regulation, and the arousal dimension of emotional experience. © 2013 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",24077571,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84885464592

This study aimed to: (a) compare the activity intensities experienced by young adults while playing active tennis gaming with conventional sedentary gaming, tennis game-play, and current activity recommendations for health; and (b) identify changes in activity intensities across playing time. After habitualization, 10 active young adults (age: 20.2 ± 0.4 years; stature: 1.74 ± 0.03 m; body mass: 67.7 ± 3.3 kg) completed 3 experimental trials (sedentary gaming, active tennis gaming, and tennis game-play) on separate days in a randomized order. Heart rate (HR) and metabolic equivalents (METs) were averaged across 5 minutes and 10 minutes intervals, and the entire 20 minutes bout within each condition. Active gaming produced greater intensities across 5-10, 10-15, and 15-20 minutes time intervals compared with sedentary gaming (p &lt; 0.01). Tennis game-play elicited greater HR (67 ± 5% HRmax) and METs (5.0 ± 0.2) responses than both sedentary (40 ± 2% HRmax, 1.1 ± 0.1 METs) and active gaming (45 ± 2% HRmax, 1.4 ± 0.1 METs) (p &lt; 0.001).

However, certain categories of people are excluded from this form of entertainment and social interaction because they are unable to use the interface of the games. The reason for this can be deficits in motor control, vision or hearing. By using automatic speech recognition systems (ASR), voice driven commands can be used to control the game, which can thus open up the possibility for people with motor system difficulty to be included in game communities. This paper aims at find a standard way of using voice commands in games which uses a speech recognition system in the backend, and that can be universally applied for designing inclusive games. Present speech recognition systems however, do not support emotions, attitudes, tones etc. This is a drawback because such expressions can be vital for gaming. Taking multiple types of existing genres of games into account and analyzing their voice command requirements, a general ASRS module is proposed which can work as a common platform for designing inclusive games. A fuzzy logic controller proposed then is to enhance the system. The standard voice driven module can be based on algorithm or fuzzy controller which can be used to design software plug-ins or can be included in microchip. It then can be integrated with the game engines; creating the possibility of voice driven universal access for controlling games. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84878846351

We assess the effectiveness of a 3D serious game as a new tool for frequent ALS retraining. Methods: We developed a 3D serious game for scenario-based ALS retraining. The serious game, called EMSAVE, was designed to promote self-correction while playing. We organized a retraining course in which 40 ALS providers played two cardiac arrest scenarios with EMSAVE and took a test with 38 multiple-choice questions before and after playing. We administered the same test again 3 months later to evaluate retention. Participants also rated EMSAVE and the overall retraining experience. Results: After using EMSAVE, the number of correct answers per participant increased by 4.8 (95%CI +3.4, +6.2, p<. 0.001) and all but one participant improved. After 3 months, despite an expected decrease in ALS knowledge and skills (-1.9 correct answers, 95%CI -0.6, -3.3, p<. 0.01), there was a significant retention benefit (+2.9 correct answers per participant, 95%CI +1.5, +4.2, p<. 0.001).

Our cohort consisted of 103 actual gamblers who reported previous gambling activity on VLT's on a regular basis. We assess the effectiveness of graphic warnings vs. text-only warnings and the effectiveness of two major arguments (i.e., family vs. financial disruption). A 2 × 2 factorial design was used to test the direct and combined effects of two variables (i.e., warning content and presence vs. absence of a graphic). It was found that the presence of a graphic enhances both cognitive appraisal and fear, and has positive effects on the Depth of Information Processing. In addition, graphic content combined with family disruptions is more effective for changing attitudes and complying with the warning than other combinations of the manipulated variables.

Study design: Fifteen children (8 males, 10.1 ± 0.7 years, body mass index 17.9 ± 2.4 kg.m-2) undertook a graded exercise test and 2 × 15 minute exergaming sessions (Xbox 360â€Kinect); high intensity exergaming (HiE, Kinect Sports-200 m Hurdles) and low intensity exergaming (LoE, Kinect Sports-Ten Pin Bowling). Brachial artery FMD, a measure of endothelial function and arterial health, was measured before and immediately after each exergaming intervention. Actihearts were used to measure EE and HR during game play and a physical activity enjoyment scale assessed enjoyment. Results: Average HR during HiE (146 ± 11 beats per minute) was greater than during LoE (104 ± 11 beats per minute, P &lt;.05), a pattern reinforced by EE data (HiE 294.6 ± 75.2 J.min-1.kg-1, LoE 73.7 ± 44.0 J.min -1.kg-1, P &lt;.05).

The aim of this study was to examine differences in self-concept and degree of avatar identification in World of Warcraft addicted, non-addicted and naive (nonexperienced) participants. Methods: Participants (n = 45) completed interviews and self-report questionnaires on social, emotional and physical aspects of self-concept. Attributes of participants' 'actual self', 'ideal self' and their avatar were assessed using the Giessen test. The extent of avatar identification was examined by assessing differences between 'ideal self' and avatar evaluations. Results: In contrast to nonaddicted and naive participants, addicted players showed a more negative body appraisal and lower self-esteem as well as lower permeability, social response, general mood and social potency on the Giessen test subscales. They further showed significantly lower discrepancies between 'ideal self' and avatar ratings on nearly all Giessen test subscales. Discussion: The results point towards impairments in self-concept and a higher degree in avatar identification in addicted MMORPG players compared to the remaining participants.

Subset applications such as online games are notorious for their sensitivity to latency and high bandwidth demands. By omitting the centralised mechanisms that underpin current commercial implementations, the task of managing a disparate and dynamic peer population is made ever more daunting. For any VE, arbitrating the interactions between players is an inescapable need. Online games are equal parts collaboration and competition, requiring robust conflict resolution mechanisms to govern game-play. With centralised systems, arbitration duties are simply assigned to a provisioned server infrastructure. In a P2P system however, the issue looms large. As such, managing arbitration loads across the peer population is the focus here. Being a game-play arbitrator entails added bandwidth and processing demands. Thus, great care is needed to avoid overloading peers whilst providing a responsive and uninterrupted experience. The work here exploits 3D Voronoi Diagrams (3D-VD) as a scalable, flexible and fault-tolerant P2P overlay that is able to automatically balance arbitration loads amongst peers.

The preferred treatment of blunt kidney injury varies according to grade of severity, with a preference for non-operative management in most instances. Discussion We examine an unusual case of blunt renal trauma. In this case, our patient presented with severe flank pain and hematuria after a game of softball. Our focused abdominal sonography for trauma revealed fluid in the splenorenal recess concerning for intra-abdominal injury, and subsequent abdominal computed tomography confirmed a grade IV kidney laceration. Conclusion Our patient was managed medically despite his high grade of injury. This article reviews the diagnosis and management of blunt renal trauma and highlights the fact that despite significant injury, a patient can go on to do well with conservative management alone. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",23845527,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84883454036

However, young children are unable to spend a long time grading many attributes or indexes after playing. Thus, selecting the most important aspects to be analyzed is required in order to perform a non-time consuming and significant evaluation method to be used with children. Hence, this work is focused on designing an evaluation method to assess emotions when young children (3-5 years old) play a video game. In particular, we are interested in educational video games because of the importance that emotion has in motivation, which in turn is highly important in education. Although the method presented follows the pre-test, test and post-test classic structure, the activities carried out in each of these phases have been modified to, firstly, include no elements which require reading-writing skills, which are as yet undeveloped at this age and, secondly, to limit the emotional impact that children can suffer when they are aware that they are being evaluated. We have applied the proposed method in a sample of 39 children playing the educational video game ""Ato's Adventure"", which was in its final development phases, obtaining very promising results both for the analysis method and for the video game. © J.UCS.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84882967322

Cognitive remediation studies indicate that targeted cognitive and/or social-cognitive training improves behavioral performance on trained skills. However, the neural effects of training in schizophrenia and their relation to behavioral gains are largely unknown. This study tested whether a 50-h intervention which included both cognitive and social-cognitive training would influence neural mechanisms that support social ccognition. Schizophrenia participants completed a computer-based intervention of either auditory-based cognitive training (AT) plus social-cognition training (SCT) (N=11) or non-specific computer games (CG) (N=11). Assessments included a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) task of facial emotion recognition, and behavioral measures of cognition, social cognition, and functional outcome. The fMRI results showed the predicted group-by-time interaction. Results were strongest for emotion recognition of happy, surprise and fear: relative to CG participants, AT+SCT participants showed a neural activity increase in bilateral amygdala, right putamen and right medial prefrontal cortex. Across all participants, pre-to-post intervention neural activity increase in these regions predicted behavioral improvement on an independent emotion perception measure (MSCEIT: Perceiving Emotions). Among AT+SCT participants alone, neural activity increase in right amygdala predicted behavioral improvement in emotion perception. The findings indicate that combined cognition and social-cognition training improves neural systems that support social-cognition skills. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",23746615,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84879462233

In line with previous theory, depression is interpreted to provide means for not participating in joint enterprises that would otherwise be difficult to avoid ('bargaining' model); therefore, it provides an additional alternative strategy to social-imitation dynamics occurring in Public Good Games. Average income from joint enterprises modeled with a Public Good Game is interpreted to drive group-level genetic selection. Based on these assumptions, it is shown that if a joint enterprise is sufficiently important for both the between-individual and the between-groups competition, then a nonparticipation strategy (or gene for depression vulnerability) will be present in total population almost surely (i.e., with probability one). The modeling framework serves to explain several other seemingly unrelated empirical observations, such as association between income inequality and depression, co-morbidity and proximal biological mechanisms for negative emotions, and mechanisms for the social network-dynamics of emotion. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",23608629,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84877881876

So far, the relationship between stimuli, affect, and action has been mainly studied in highly controlled laboratory conditions. In order to find the generalization of this relationship to social interaction, we assess the influence of the salience of social stimuli on human interaction. We constructed reality ball game in a mixed reality space where pairs of people collaborated in order to compete with an opposing team. We coupled the players with team members with varying social salience by using both physical and virtual representations of remote players (i.e., avatars). We observe that, irrespective of the team composition, winners and losers display significantly different inter- and intrateam spatial behaviors. We show that subjects regulate their interpersonal distance to both virtual and physical team members in similar ways, but in proportion to the vividness of the stimulus. As an independent validation of this social salience effect, we show that this behavioral effect is also displayed in physiological correlates of arousal. In addition, we found a strong correlation between performance, physiology, and the subjective reports of the subjects. Our results show that proxemics is consistent with affective responses, confirming the existence of a social salience effect.

As part of a feasibility study to assess environmental and parenting influences on preschooler physical activity (PA) (Niños Activos), the aim of this study was to identify what parents do to encourage or discourage PA among Hispanic 3-5 year old children to inform the development of a new PA parenting practice instrument and future interventions to increase PA among Hispanic youth. Methods: Nominal Group Technique (NGT), a structured multi-step group procedure, was used to elicit and prioritize responses from 10 groups of Hispanic parents regarding what parents do to encourage (5 groups) or discourage (5 groups) preschool aged children to be active. Five groups consisted of parents with low education (less than high school) and 5 with high education (high school or greater) distributed between the two NGT questions. Results: Ten NGT groups (n = 74, range 4-11/group) generated 20-46 and 42-69 responses/group for practices that encourage or discourage PA respectively. Eight to 18 responses/group were elected as the most likely to encourage or discourage PA. Parental engagement in child activities, modeling PA, and feeding the child well were identified as parenting practices that encourage child PA. Allowing TV and videogame use, psychological control, physical or emotional abuse, and lack of parental engagement emerged as parenting practices that discourage children from being active. There were few differences in the pattern of responses by education level.Conclusions: Parents identified ways they encourage and discourage 3-5 year-olds from PA, suggesting both are important targets for interventions. These will inform the development of a new PA parenting practice scale to be further evaluated. Further research should explore the role parents play in discouraging child PA, especially in using psychological control or submitting children to abuse, which were new findings in this study. © 2013 O'Connor et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",23919301,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84881041207

At the behavioral level, lower fairness ratings and higher rejection rates were revealed for unfair losses than unfair gains. At the neural level, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, bilateral anterior insula, anterior cingulate cortex/anterior middle cingulate cortex and bilateral dorsal striatum were associated with rejection (vs. acceptance) in the loss context, but not in the gain context. Together, our data indicated that participants may experience more unfairness in UG and stronger desire to sanction social norm violations in the loss context than in the gain context, inducing more fairness-related neutral activities when rejecting (vs. accepting) unfair losses than unfair gains.

Children with cerebral palsy (CP) are prone to secondary complications related to physical inactivity and poor cardiorespiratory capacity. This problem could be greatly attenuated through the use of video games that incorporate physical activity for 2 reasons: Video games already represent an important component of leisure time in younger people, and such games can lead to a high level of exercise intensity in people who are healthy. Objective. The study objective was to evaluate exercise intensity in children with spastic diplegic CP and children who were typically developing while playing with an active video game console. Design. This was a cross-sectional study. Methods. Ten children (7-12 years old) with spastic diplegic CP (Gross Motor Function Classification System level I or II) and 10 children who were age matched and typically developing were evaluated in a movement analysis laboratory. Four games were played with the active video game console (jogging, bicycling, snowboarding, and skiing) for 40 minutes. Heart rate was recorded during the entire playing period with a heart rate belt monitor. Exercise intensity was defined as the percentage of heart rate reserve (HRR). In addition, lower extremity motion analysis was carried out during the final minute of the playing period for the jogging and bicycling games. Results. No difference between groups was observed for any variables. A main effect of games was observed for the amount of time spent at an intensity greater than 40% of HRR. Specifically, more than 50% of the playing time for the jogging game and more than 30% of the playing time for the bicycling game were spent at an intensity greater than 40% of HRR. In addition, the jogging game produced a larger range of motion than the bicycling game. Limitations. A limitation of this study was the relatively small and heterogeneous sample. Conclusions. For all 4 games, similar exercise intensity levels were observed for children who were typically developing and children with CP, suggesting that children with CP could obtain exercise-related benefits similar to those obtained by children without CP while playing with an active video game console. © 2013 American Physical Therapy Association.",23580626,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84880971019

Based on self-determination theory (SDT; Ryan & Deci, 2000), this study hypothesized that the three basic psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness are positively associated with purpose in life, which in turn acts as a protective factor against problem video game playing among Chinese young adult players. Through a questionnaire survey with a sample of 165 Chinese adults aged between 18 and 30 years (mean age = 22.7 years), we found that perceived autonomy, competence, relatedness, and purpose in life were all negatively correlated with problem game playing. The demographic and psychological factors explained 38% of the variances of problem game playing. Specifically, gender, perceived relatedness, and purpose in life emerged as the three most salient predictors of problem game playing among the Chinese young adults. The mediating role of purpose in life was evidenced and it was found that purpose in life mediated the influences of the psychological needs proposed by SDT on problem game playing. Moreover, young men were significantly more susceptible to problem game playing than their female counterparts. To conclude, psychological needs and purpose in life influenced Chinese young adults' vulnerability to problem game playing directly or indirectly. Intervention programs that encourage social involvement and voluntary work, as well as counseling service that helps clients to search for life purpose, are suggested for intervening in problem game playing among Chinese young adults. © 2013 Copyright International Union of Psychological Science.",22506646,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84881607110

The nucleus accumbens (NAc) receives dopaminergic projections from the ventral tegmental area and works as a key brain region for the positive incentive value of rewards. Because neurokinin-1 (NK1) receptor, the cognate receptor for substance P (SP), is highly expressed in the NAc, we hypothesized that the SP/NK1 receptor system might play a role in positive reward processing in the NAc in humans. Therefore, we conducted a functional MRI (fMRI) study to assess the effects of an NK1 receptor antagonist on human reward processing through a monetary incentive delay task that is known to elicit robust activation in the NAc especially during gain anticipation. Eighteen healthy adults participated in two series of an fMRI study, taking either a placebo or the NK1 receptor antagonist aprepitant. Behavioural measurements revealed that there was no significant difference in reaction time, hit rate, or self-reported effort for incentive cues between the placebo and aprepitant treatments. fMRI showed significant decrease in blood oxygenation-level-dependent signals in the NAc during gain anticipation with the aprepitant treatment compared to the placebo treatment. These results suggest that SP/NK1 receptor system is involved in processing of positive incentive anticipation and plays a role in accentuating positive valence in association with the primary dopaminergic pathways in the reward circuit. © CINP 2013.",23406545,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84880517822

However, designing an exergame for specific training purposes, with intensity levels suited to the needs and skills of the players, requires the investigation of motion performance to study player experience.This study investigates how parameters of a Kinect-based exergame, combined with balance training exercises, influence the balance control ability and intensity level the player can tolerate, by analyzing both objective and gameplay-based player experience, and taking enjoyment and difficulty levels into account.The exergame tested required participants to maintain their balance standing on one leg within a posture frame (PF) while a force plate evaluated the player's balance control ability in both static and dynamic gaming modes. The number of collisions with the PF depended on the frame's travel time for static PFs, and the leg-raising rate and angle for dynamic PFs. In terms of center of pressure (COP) metrics, significant impacts were caused by the frame's travel time on MDIST-AP for static PFs, and the leg-raising rate on MDIST-ML and TOTEX for dynamic PFs. The best static PF balance control performance was observed with a larger frame offset by a travel time of 2 seconds, and the worst performance with a smaller frame and a travel time of 1 second. The best dynamic PF performance was with a leg-raising rate of 1 second at a 45-degree angle, while the worst performance was with a rate of 2 seconds at a 90-degree angle.The results demonstrated that different evaluation methods for player experience could result in different findings, making it harder to study the design of those exergames with training purposes based on player experience. © 2013 Sun and Lee.",23922716,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84880786719

One Go game is divided into three stages: the opening, the middle, and the ending stages. Millions of people regularly play Go in countries around the world. The game is played by two players. One is White and another is Black. The players alternate placing one of their stones on an empty intersection of a square grid-patterned game board. The player with more territory wins the game. This paper proposes a soft-computing-based emotional expression mechanism and applies it to the game of computer Go to make Go beginners enjoy watching Go game and keep their tension on the game. First, the knowledge base and rule base of the proposed mechanism are defined by following the standards of the fuzzy markup language. The soft-computing mechanism for Go regional alarm level is responsible for showing the inferred regional alarm level to Go beginners. Based on the inferred board situation, the fuzzy inference mechanisms for emotional pleasure and arousal are responsible for inferring the pleasure degree and arousal degree, respectively. An emotional expression mapping mechanism maps the inferred degree of pleasure and degree of arousal into the emotional expression of the eye robot. The protocol transmission mechanism finally sends the pre-defined protocol to the eye robot via universal serial bus interface to make the eye robot express its emotional motion. From the experimental results, it shows that the eye robot can support Go beginners to have fun and retain their tension while watching or playing a game of Go. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84878775081

A person's functional health status constitutes a dynamic interaction between components identified in the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF). The aim of this study was to investigate the short-term effects of active video game play on community adults using the ICF. Methods Sixty community adults with an average age of 59.3 years and without physical disabilities were recruited. Over 2 weeks, each adult participated in six sessions of active video game play lasting 20 minutes each. Participants were assessed before and after the intervention. Variables were collected using sources related to the ICF components, including the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory, Biodex Stability System, chairrising time, Frenchay Activity Index, Rivermead Mobility Index, Chronic Pain Grade Questionnaire, Work Ability Index, and World Health Organization Quality of Life-Brief Version. Results Compared to baseline data, significantly reduced risk of a fall measured by Biodex Stability System and improvements in disability scores measured by the Chronic Pain Grade Questionnaire were noted. There was no significant change in the other variables measured.

People who participate in large amounts of sedentary behaviors, relative to those who do not, tend to be less physically active, less physically fit, and at greater risk for health problems. However, cell phone use does not have to be a sedentary behavior as these devices are portable. It can occur while standing or during mild-to-moderate intensity physical activity. Thus, the relationship between cell phone use, physical and sedentary activity, and physical fitness is unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate these relationships among a sample of healthy college students.Methods: Participants were first interviewed about their physical activity behavior and cell phone use. Then body composition was assessed and the validated self-efficacy survey for exercise behaviors completed. This was followed by a progressive exercise test on a treadmill to exhaustion. Peak oxygen consumption (VO2 peak) during exercise was used to measure cardiorespiratory fitness. Hierarchical regression was used to assess the relationship between cell phone use and cardiorespiratory fitness after controlling for sex, self-efficacy, and percent body fat. Interview data was transcribed, coded, and Chi-square analysis was used to compare the responses of low and high frequency cell phone users.Results: Cell phone use was significantly (p = 0.047) and negatively (β = -0.25) related to cardio respiratory fitness independent of sex, self-efficacy, and percent fat which were also significant predictors (p &lt; 0.05). Interview data offered several possible explanations for this relationship. First, high frequency users were more likely than low frequency users to report forgoing opportunities for physical activity in order to use their cell phones for sedentary behaviors. Second, low frequency users were more likely to report being connected to active peer groups through their cell phones and to cite this as a motivation for physical activity. Third, high levels of cell phone use indicated a broader pattern of sedentary behaviors apart from cell phone use, such as watching television.Conclusion: Cell phone use, like traditional sedentary behaviors, may disrupt physical activity and reduce cardiorespiratory fitness. © 2013 Lepp et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",23800133,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84879126802

In these advertisements, the superimposition of science fiction imagery over depictions of Air Force operations frames these missions as near-future sci-fi adventure, ironically summarized by the tagline: ""It's not science fiction. It's what we do every day."" Focusing on an early advertisement for the Air Force's Reaper unmanned aerial vehicle, this essay explores how themes essential to the science fiction genre play a role in influencing contemporary attitudes about autonomous and semi-autonomous robotic weapons, as well as the way in which the aesthetic and functional qualities of these advanced technologies are used to frame moral arguments about their use. As a reconfiguration of the near-future battleground in the guise of science fiction, the ""Reaper"" ad reveals the way in which science fiction has come to serve as a functional-aesthetic benchmark and cultural sounding board, against which ""every day"" technologies can be measured and claims about their value, ethos, and social appeal are made. This essay explores the ethical entanglements between science fiction film and video games, and military technology, and the complex role science fiction plays in influencing public attitudes towards military technologies. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84879781063

Here we report the protocol of a randomised controlled trial of the effects of emotion recognition training on mood in a sample of individuals with depressive symptoms over a 6-week follow-up period.Methods/Design: We will recruit 190 adults from the general population who report high levels of depressive symptoms (defined as a score ≥ 14 on the Beck Depression Inventory-II). Participants will attend a screening session and will be randomised to intervention or control procedures, repeated five times over consecutive days (Monday to Friday). A follow-up session will take place at end-of -treatment, 2-weeks and 6-weeks after training. Our primary study outcome will be depressive symptoms, Beck Depression Inventory- II (rated over the past two weeks). Our secondary outcomes are: depressive symptoms, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression; anxiety symptoms, Beck Anxiety Inventory (rated over the past month); positive affect, Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (rated as 'how you feel right now'); negative affect, Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (rated as 'how you feel right now'); emotion sensitivity, Emotion Recognition Task (test phase); approach motivation and persistence, the Fishing Game; and depressive interpretation bias, Scrambled Sentences Test.Discussion: This study is of a novel cognitive bias modification technique that targets biases in emotional processing characteristic of depression, and can be delivered automatically via computer, Internet or Smartphone. It therefore has potential to be a valuable cost-effective adjunctive treatment for depression which may be used together with more traditional psychotherapy, cognitive-behavioural therapy and pharmacotherapy.Trial registration: Current Controlled Trials: ISRCTN17767674. © 2013 Adams et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",23725208,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84878376838

The school years are known to be a critical period in the life course for shaping attitudes and behaviors. Children look to schools for much of their access to physical activity. Thus, through the provision of appropriate physical activity programs, schools have the power to influence apt physical activity choices, especially for underserved children where disparities in obesity-related outcomes exist. Objectives: To evaluate the impact of a nurse directed, coordinated, culturally sensitive, school-based, family-centered lifestyle program on activity behaviors and body mass index. Design, settings and participants: This was a parallel group, randomized controlled trial utilizing a community-based participatory research approach, through a partnership with a University and 5 community schools. Participants included 251 children ages 8-12 from elementary schools in urban, low-income neighborhoods in Los Angeles, USA. Methods: The intervention included Kids N Fitness©, a 6-week program which met weekly to provide 45min of structured physical activity and a 45min nutrition education class for parents and children. Intervention sites also participated in school-wide wellness activities, including health and counseling services, staff professional development in health promotion, parental education newsletters, and wellness policies for the provision of healthy foods at the school. The Child and Adolescent Trial for Cardiovascular Health School Physical Activity and Nutrition Student Questionnaire measured physical activity behavior, including: daily physical activity, participation in team sports, attending physical education class, and TV viewing/computer game playing. Anthropometric measures included height, weight, body mass index, resting blood pressure, and waist circumference.

The intrinsic heterogeneity of individuals' capability and willingness makes significant impact on the promotion of cooperation rate. In this paper, we propose a two-phase Heterogeneous Public Goods Game (HPGG) model to study the cooperation dynamics in CSNs. We introduce two factors to represent the heterogeneity of individual behaviors and the benefit-to-cost enhancement of population, respectively. Based on HPGG CSN model, we quantitatively investigate the relationship between cooperation rate and individuals' heterogeneous behaviors from an evolutionary game perspective. Simulations on the population structure of scale-free networks show the evolution of cooperation in CSNs has no-trivial dependence on the individuals' heterogeneous behaviors. Compared with standard PGG and single-phase heterogeneous PGG, HPGG provides a more precise mechanism to promote cooperation rate of CSNs. Finally, data traces collected from real experiments also demonstrate the preciseness of HPGG in formulating the cooperation dynamics on CSNs. © 1983-2012 IEEE.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84878147385

The extent to which active engagement influences dopaminergic brain reward circuit responses remains unsettled. Here we show that striatal reward circuit responses elicited by successes (wins) and failures (losses) in a video game are stronger during active than vicarious gameplay. Eleven healthy males both played a competitive first-person tank shooter game (active playing) and watched a pre-recorded gameplay video (vicarious playing) while their hemodynamic brain activation was measured with 3-tesla functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Wins and losses were paired with symmetrical monetary rewards and punishments during active and vicarious playing so that the external reward context remained identical during both conditions. Brain activation was stronger in the orbitomedial prefrontal cortex (omPFC) during winning than losing, both during active and vicarious playing conditions. In contrast, both wins and losses suppressed activations in the midbrain and striatum during active playing; however, the striatal suppression, particularly in the anterior putamen, was more pronounced during loss than win events. Sensorimotor confounds related to joystick movements did not account for the results. Self-ratings indicated losing to be more unpleasant during active than vicarious playing. Our findings demonstrate striatum to be selectively sensitive to self-acquired rewards, in contrast to frontal components of the reward circuit that process both self-acquired and passively received rewards. We propose that the striatal responses to repeated acquisition of rewards that are contingent on game related successes contribute to the motivational pull of video-game playing. © 2013 Kätsyri, Hari, Ravaja and Nummenmaa.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84933673401

A study comparing one hour of watching TV, playing typical video games, or playing motion-controlled video games found a difference across groups in energy intake, but the reasons for this difference are not clear. As a secondary analysis, we investigated several types of distraction to determine potential psychosocial mechanisms which may account for greater energy intake observed during sedentary screen time as compared to motion-controlled video gaming.Methods: Feelings of enjoyment, engagement (mental immersion), spatial presence (the feeling of being in the game), and transportation (immersion in a narrative) were investigated in 120 young adults aged 18 - 35 (60 female).Results: Only narrative transportation was associated with total caloric intake (ρ = .205, P = .025). Transportation was also higher in the TV group than in the gaming groups (P = .002) and higher in males than in females (P = .003). Transportation mediated the relationship between motion-controlled gaming (as compared to TV watching) and square root transformed energy intake (indirect effect = -1.34, 95% confidence interval -3.57, -0.13). No other distraction-related variables were associated with intake.Conclusions: These results suggest that different forms of distraction may differentially affect eating behavior during screen time, and that narrative appears to be a particularly strong distractor.

Complex-samples generalized linear models were run for each combination of screen time predictor and cardiovascular risk outcome, and a clustered cardiovascular risk score, adjusting for potential confounders (including physical activity). Analyses were conducted in 2011 and 2012. Results: TV viewing, but not PC or electronic games time, was associated positively with clustered cardiovascular risk score, DBP, and SBP after adjustment for all covariates. Watching TV for >2 hours/day (compared to <1 hour/day) was associated with higher DBP (coefficient, logged and back-transformed 0.02, 95% CI=0.00, 0.04, linear trend p=0.003); SBP (logged and back-transformed 0.02, 95% CI= -0.01, 0.05, p=0.009), and clustered cardiovascular risk score (0.13, 95% CI=0.02, 0.24, p<0.001). Conclusions: TV viewing, but no other type of screen time, was associated positively with cardiovascular risk markers independently of physical activity. Studies using a single marker of screen time or sedentary behavior may conceal screen time type-specific associations. © 2013 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.",23597812,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84876362678

Results from a between-subjects experiment showed that a realistic controller and a large screen display induced greater aggression, presence, and arousal than a conventional mouse and a small screen display, respectively, and confirmed that trait aggression was a significant predictor of gamers' state aggression. Contrary to GAM, however, arousal showed no effects on aggression; instead, presence emerged as a significant mediator. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2013.",23505967,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84878488048

Design/methodology/approach: The author's research methodology is based on Miryoku Engineering. The author interviewed 11 knowledgeable gamers by the evaluation grid method (EGM) and surveyed 321 players through a questionnaire in order to gather data about their preferences, which were then analysed using quantification theory type I. Findings: The semantic structure of the appeal of the games was determined from interviews with knowledgeable gamers (EGM). This structure represents a hierarchy of the relationship between the types of appeal or appeal factors, the reasons for gamers' preferences, and the specific characteristics of SNS games. According to the statistical analysis, the most important sociocultural appeal factors of SNS games are ""practicable and realizable"" and ""innovative and unique"", and these are affected in varying degrees by particular reasons and characteristics. Practical implications: The author has found that sociocultural factors influence the design of SNS games significantly. In addition, the issue of how to integrate the sociocultural factors into the design of games is critical to the success of the marketing strategies of SNS games in different areas or countries. Originality/value: The author's findings provide important information for designers and researchers of SNS games.

Adjusting TXOP can lead to better bandwidth utilization and QoS provisioning. To improve WLAN throughput performance, EDCA packet bursting can be used in 802.11e, meaning that once a station has gained an EDCA-TXOP, it can be allowed to transmit more than one frame without re-contending for the channel. Following the access to the channel, the station can send multiple frames as long as the total access time does not exceed the TXOP Limit. This mechanism can reduce the network overhead and increase the channel utilization instead. However, packet bursting may cause unfairness in addition to increasing jitter, delay and loss. To the best of the authors' knowledge, although TXOP tuning has been investigated through different methods, it has not been considered within a game theory framework. In this study, based on the analytical models of EDCA, a game theoretic approach called GTXOP is proposed to determine TXOP dynamically (i.e. according to the dynamisms of WLAN networks and the number of nodes in the network). Using GTXOP, each node can choose its TXOP autonomously, such that in addition to QoS improvement, the overall network performance is also improved. © 2013 Ghazvini et al.",23650539,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84877022694

Method: Participants included individuals 7 to 17 years of age (overall sample mean age 12.40 ± 3.01 years), with ""narrow-phenotype"" pediatric BD (n = 30) or ADHD (n = 38), or typically developing controls (TDC) with no psychiatric disorders themselves or in their first-degree relatives (n = 41). In the BD group, comorbid diagnoses were allowed; however, youth in the ADHD group were excluded for comorbid mood or anxiety disorders. Patient groups were not excluded for psychotropic medication use. Emotional face identification was assessed using the computerized Diagnostic Analysis of Non-Verbal Accuracy (DANVA). Results: Participants with BD made significantly more identification errors on child happy faces than either TDCs (p =.03) or participants with ADHD (p =.01). Furthermore, youth with BD (0.33 ± 0.55) were more likely than youth with ADHD (0.11 ± 0.31) to make errors on low-intensity child happy faces (p =.05) but not high-intensity happy faces (p = NS). Participants with BD and ADHD made significantly more total errors in child face labeling than did TDCs, although participants with BD and ADHD did not differ from one another. Conclusion: Our data suggest that youths with BD have specific alterations in emotional face identification of happy faces, an important finding that supports theories that response to positively valenced emotional stimuli may be especially salient in BD.

They have a number of degrees-of-freedom (DOF) giving them enhanced mobility, e.g., the ability to climb stairs and over obstacles. However, operating them remotely is complicated because their controllers are similar to conventional control pads or joysticks used in computer games or toys. It is hard for the operator to achieve an intuitive and natural feel, thus mistakes are common. To intuitively control the locomotion of a UGV with many DOFs, a master-slave operation was implemented. A novel UGV called Kurogane, which consists of a typical crawler combined with a human-like torso section, was developed. The torso section is controlled via a wearable controller interface. In addition, the UGV is equipped with models of muscle viscoelasticity and stretch reflex, called the involuntary autonomous adaptation system, inspired by the adaptive compliance of animals. The proposed system can autonomously and flexibly react and adapt to irregular terrain in real time. Therefore, the operation of Kurogane is simple and does not require great skill or precision. Experimental results show that it performs well over a fixed step, stairs, and rough outdoor terrain. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84875830364

However, these two effects have not been demonstrated in the same individuals in a single study. The current study used event-related brain potentials (ERPs) to examine the effects of playing an action or non-action video game on the processing of emotion in facial expression. The data revealed that 10 h of playing an action or non-action video game had differential effects on the ERPs relative to a no-contact control group. Playing an action game resulted in two effects: one that reflected an increase in the amplitude of the ERPs following training over the right frontal and posterior regions that was similar for angry, happy, and neutral faces; and one that reflected a reduction in the allocation of attention to happy faces. In contrast, playing a non-action game resulted in changes in slow wave activity over the central-parietal and frontal regions that were greater for targets (i.e., angry and happy faces) than for non-targets (i.e., neutral faces). These data demonstrate that the contrasting effects of action video games on visuospatial and emotion processing occur in the same individuals following the same level of gaming experience. This observation leads to the suggestion that caution should be exercised when using action video games to modify visual processing, as this experience could also have unintended effects on emotion processing. © 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.",23419898,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84875211626

Method: Undergraduate participants played a computer game requiring them to learn which stimuli (beans) would increase/decrease their points. Later, participants classified the valence of game beans and novel ones varying in resemblance to game beans. The weighting bias in attitude generalization was estimated as the average response to novel beans, controlling for game bean learning. We examined whether this bias related to judgments of hypothetical situations concerning interpersonal relationships (Study 1), threat assessment (Study 2), risk propensities (Study 3), and risk behavior (Study 6). We also assessed whether valence weighting is specifically predictive of novel situations (Studies 4 and 5). Finally, we explored participants' ability to self-report their weighting bias (Study 7). Results: Valence weighting in attitude generalization was related to judgments of novel situations and risk behavior.

Susceptibility to postoperative complications, cardiac rehabilitation is indicated. Therapeutic resources, such as virtual reality has been helping the rehabilitational process. The aim of the study was to evaluate the use of virtual reality in the functional rehabilitation of patients in the postoperative period. Methods: Patients were randomized into two groups, Virtual Reality (VRG, n = 30) and Control (CG, n = 30). The response to treatment was assessed through the functional independence measure (FIM), by the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP). Evaluations were performed preoperatively and postoperatively. Results: On the first day after surgery, patients in both groups showed decreased functional performance. However, the VRG showed lower reduction (45.7±2.3) when compared toCG (35.06±2.09, P<0.05) in first postoperative day, and no sig-nifcant difference in performance on discharge day (P>0.05). In evaluating the NHP field, we observed a signifcant decrease in pain score at third assessment (P<0.05). These patients also had a higher energy level in the first evaluation (P<0.05). There were no differences with statistical significance for emotional reactions, physical ability, and social interaction. The length of stay was signifcantly shorter in patients of VRG (9.4±0.5 days vs. 12.2 ± 0.9 days, P<0.05), which also had a higher 6MWD (319.9±19.3 meters vs. 263.5±15.4 meters, P<0.02).Conclusion: Adjunctive treatment with virtual reality demonstrated benefits, with better functional performance in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.",23939326,"English; Portuguese",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84881577176

Traditional Camera Motions are artificial oscillating motions applied to the subjective viewpoint when walking in the VE, and they are meant to evoke and reproduce the visual flow generated during a human walk. Our novel camera motions are: (1) multistate, (2) personified, and (3) they can take into account the topography of the virtual terrain. Being multistate, our CMs can account for different states of locomotion in VE namely: walking, but also running and sprinting. Being personified, our CMs can be adapted to avatar's physiology such as to its size, weight or training status. They can then take into account avatar's fatigue and recuperation for updating visual CMs accordingly. Last, our approach is adapted to the topography of the VE. Running over a strong positive slope would rapidly decrease the advance speed of the avatar, increase its energy loss, and eventually change the locomotion mode, influencing the visual feedback of the camera motions. Our new approach relies on a locomotion simulator partially inspired by human physiology and implemented for a real-time use in Desktop VR. We have conducted a series of experiments to evaluate the perception of our new CMs by naive participants. Results notably show that participants could discriminate and perceive transitions between the different locomotion modes, by relying exclusively on our CMs. They could also perceive some properties of the avatar being used and, overall, very well appreciated the new CMs techniques. Taken together, our results suggest that our new CMs could be introduced in Desktop VR applications involving first-person navigation, in order to enhance sensations of walking, running, and sprinting, with potentially different avatars and over uneven terrains, such as for: training, virtual visits or video games. © 2013 IEEE.",23428450,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84883481897

Perhaps this is why the echo of the Hispano-lslamic culture, which is still latent in Cordoba, has subconsciously signified more than a footnote to our proposal. In the face of the homogeneity imposed by our global civilisation, in all aspects of life, the Centre of Contemporary Art aspires to interpret a very different western culture, going beyond the cliche of this expression so frequently used. Distrusting the supposed efficacy and flexibility of a neutral and universal container, nowadays commonly used, allows us to imagine a building closely linked to a place and to a distant memory, where every space is individually shaped, and to a time which can transform itself and expand in sequence with different dimensions, uses and spatial qualities. We have always been admirers of the hidden geometric laws through which those artists, artisans and master builders of a remote Islamic past were capable of creating, the multiple and isotropic spaces within the Mosque; a building facetted with vaults and muqarna windows, permutations of ornamental motifs with lattice windows, paving and ataurique decorations, or the rules and narrative rhythms implicit in the poems and tales of Islamic tradition. Like those literary structures which feature a story within a story, often within yet another- a story without an end -we conceived the project as beginning with a system, a law generated by a repeating geometric pattern, that would originate in a hexagonal shape, which then in turn contains three different types of rooms, of 150 m2, 90 m2, and 60 m2. Like a combinatorial game, the permutations of these three areas would generate sequences of different spaces that can possibly come to create a single exhibition area. The artists' workshops on the ground floor and the laboratories on the upper floor are located adjacent to the exhibition halls, to the point where there is no strict difference between them: artistic works can be exhibited in the workshops while the exhibition halls can also be used as areas for artistic production. The assembly room - the black box-is designed as a stage area suitable for theatrical productions, conferences, film screenings, or even for audiovisual exhibitions. The Centre of Contemporary Art is not a centralised organism: its centre moves from one area to another, it is everywhere. It is designed as a sequence of rooms linked to a public walkway, where the different functions of the building come together. Conceived as a crossroads and meeting place, it is a communal area for exhibitions and exchange of ideas, to view an installation, see exhibitions, visit the cafe, use the mediateque, wait for the start of a show in the black box, or perhaps gaze at the Guadalquivir river. The materials coalesce to suggest the character of an art factory, which pervades the entire project. Throughout the interior, walls and slabs of concrete and continuous concrete floors establish a spatial area capable of being transformed at individual points using different forms of intervention. A network of electrical, digital, audio and lighting infrastructures creates the possibility of multiple views and connections everywhere. Outside, the building aspires to express itself through one material: GRC prefabricated panels that at the same time clad the opaque and perforated facades, or make up the flat and sloping roofs of the halls. The industrialised concept of the system as well as the conditions of impermeability, insulation and lightness of the material, contribute to guarantee the precision and rationality of its execution but also play a part in the interconnected concept that governs the whole project. The facade that faces onto the river, a true mask that protagonizes the exterior facade of the building, is conceived as a screen perforated by several polygonal openings with LED-type monochromatic maps behind them. With an appropriate computer programme, video signals will generate images and texts that will be reflected on the river's surface and enable installations specifically conceived for the place. During the day, natural light will filter through the perforations and penetrate the interior covered walkway. In the Centre for Contemporary Art, artists, visitors, experts, researchers and the public, will meet as in a contemporary zouk, without an obvious spatial hierarchy. It will be a centre for creative artistic processes that will closely link the architectural space with the public: an open laboratory where architecture attempts to provoke new modes of expression. Some of the most recent artistic proposals linked to the most recent technologies appear to move away from materiality and submerge themselves in a virtuality disconnected from a concrete place, but perhaps through it, disagreeing with this interpretation - which has become a commonplace - we are convinced that the building itself, the Guadalquivir river, the present and the past of Cordoba, will not simply be a casual circumstance but, as it has been for us as well, will be the start of a dialogue, agreement, or perhaps rejection. For are these not also emotions that underlie the search for all artistic expression?.",,"Korean; English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84876875512

This article focuses on how opportunities for aggression are distinct online from those of offline social contexts. The model developed here is informed by a recent aggression typology, which extends the reactive-proactive distinction by distinguishing aggression based on the affective motive (appetitive vs. reactive) and the recruitment of self-control. This typology informs an analysis of psychological processes linked to individual differences that are relevant to adolescents' aggressive activities. Processes implicated include hostile schema activation, anger and fatigue effects on self-control, anger rumination, empathic failure, excitation transfer, and thrill-seeking. With these processes established, the proposed model focuses on how features of online social platforms may afford opportunities for distinct types of aggression by engaging these processes in adolescent users. Features of online settings that present distinct opportunities for activation of these processes are reviewed for each process, including social cue ambiguity, temporal lag, cue permanence, anonymity, the continual perception of audience, and the availability of online gaming and online pornography. For each of the conceptually grounded cyber-aggression-relevant processes, implications for innovative research directions on adolescent cyber-aggression are presented. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",23526207,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84876149098

The advent of a range of different consumer body motion tracking video game console peripherals raises the question whether their different technological affordances (i.e., variations in the type and number of body limbs that they can track) influence the user experience while playing dance-based exergames both in terms of the level of physical exertion and the nature of the play experience. To investigate these issues a group of subjects performed a total of six comparable dance routines selected from commercial dance-based exergames (two routines from each game) on three different consoles. The subjects' level of physical exertion was assessed by measuring oxygen consumption and heart rate. They also reported their perceived level of exertion, difficulty, and enjoyment ratings after completing each dance routine. No differences were found in the physiological measures of exertion between the peripherals/consoles. However, there were significant variations in the difficulty and enjoyment ratings between peripherals. The design implications of these results are discussed including the tension between helping to guide and coordinate player movement versus offering greater movement flexibility. © 2013 Alasdair G.

However, increased realism does not necessarily imply increased acceptance and factors such as aberrant facial expression may evoke the Uncanny Valley phenomenon. In humans, personality traits such as anger, callousness, coldness, dominance, being unconcerned, and untrustworthiness are associated with psychopathy; a visual facial marker of this condition being a lack of visible response in the eye region to emotive situations. As such, the present study investigated if inadequate upper facial animation in human-like virtual characters evoked the uncanny due to a perception of psychopathic traits within a character. The results revealed that virtual characters that showed a lack of a startle response to a scream sound were regarded as most uncanny and perceptions of personality traits associated with psychopathy were a strong predictor of reported uncanniness but, that other negative personality traits not associated with psychopathy were not. The study presents possible psychological drivers of uncanniness to inform designers why a lack of detail in a character's upper face when portraying a startle response may evoke perception of specific negative personality traits in a character, to help control the uncanny in character design. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Although it is known that alternative regulation strategies may have different emotional consequences, the effectiveness of such strategies for socially driven emotions remains unclear. In this study we investigated the efficacy of different forms of reappraisal on responses to the selfish and altruistic behavior of others in the Dictator Game. In Experiment 1, subjects mentalized the intentions of the other player in one condition, and took distance from the situation in the other. Emotion ratings were recorded after each offer. Compared with a baseline condition, mentalizing led subjects to experience their emotions more positively when receiving both selfish and altruistic proposals, whereas distancing decreased the valence when receiving altruistic offers, but did not affect the perception of selfish behavior. In Experiment 2, subjects played with both computer and human partners while reappraising the meaning of the player's intentions (with a human partner) or the meaning of the situation (with a computer partner). Results showed that both contexts were effectively modulated by reappraisal, however a stronger effect was observed when the donor was a human partner, as compared to a computer partner.

Results showed that emotion recognition was best when all three behavioural cues were present; posture + face and posture + tone of voice were joint second best.

Using extant research on tournaments and intrinsic motivation, we model competitive games as a skill-based tournament and conduct an experimental study to understand player behaviors and emotional responses under different competition conditions. When players compete with players of similar skill levels, they apply more effort as indicated by more games played and longer duration of play.

Previous studies found not only stress but also a decrease in self-esteem to precede the formation of delusions. As evidence for causal conclusions has not been provided yet, the present study assessed the direct impact of social stress on paranoid beliefs using an experimental design and considered a decrease in self-esteem as a mediator and the proneness to psychosis and paranoia as moderators of the effect. Methods: A nonclinical population sample (n = 76) was randomly assigned to an experimental (EG) or a control group condition (CG). In the EG, participants were excluded during a virtual ball game (Cyberball) by the other two players and received a negative feedback after performing a test. The CG was included in the game and received a neutral feedback. Before and after the experimental conditions, emotions, self-esteem and paranoid beliefs were assessed using state-adapted questionnaires. Results: After the social stress induction, the EG reported a higher increase in subclinical paranoid beliefs compared to the CG. The impact of social stress on paranoid ideation was mediated by a decrease in self-esteem and moderated by proneness to paranoia. Individuals who felt distressed by paranoid thoughts at baseline were more likely to react with an increase in paranoid ideation under social stress. Limitations: The results need to be confirmed in a patient sample to draw conclusions about the processes involved in the formation of delusions in clinically relevant stages. Conclusions: The impact of social stress on symptom formation and self-esteem is discussed in terms of recent models of symptom formation and interventions in psychosis. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition, further treatment in the home environment is possible. Objective: This cohort study was designed to investigate the impact of the Nintendo® Wii Balance Board as a visual compensation device after acute vestibular neuritis. Methods: Subjects were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups. Group A (n = 37) performed customized exercises with the Nintendo® Wii Balance Board. Group B (n = 34) performed only two elected exercises as a control group for comparison of the results. Both groups underwent additive therapy with steroids (intravenous) in decreasing doses (250 mg decreasing to 25 mg over 10 days). The Sensory Organization Test (SOT), Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI), Vertigo Symptom Scale (VSS), and Tinneti questionnaire were evaluated immediately before treatment (baseline), at the end of treatment, i.e. at day 5, and after 10 weeks. Results: The early use of a visual feedback system in the context of the balance training supports the central nervous vestibular compensation after peripheral labyrinthine disorders. Patients in group B (without training) required a longer in-patient stay (average 2.4 days, SD 0.4) compared with patients following early Wii rehabilitation. The absence of nystagmus under Frenzel's goggles in group A was observed 2.1 days (SD 0.5) earlier than in group B. Group A showed significantly better results in the SOT, DHI, VSS, and Tinneti questionnaire at all time points measured (p < 0.05). © 2013 Informa Healthcare.",23131174,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84874067912

This paper suggests an approach facilitating designing AI functionalities and striving to reduce, via software tool support, the amount of hand-written AI script code needed. Our approach is suitable for, e.g., creating autonomous agents with personal characteristics, capable of behaving in a natural manner. For instance, the goal-oriented agent paradigm can be applied easily with the approach. The definitions needed are written using a script language. Therefore, the agent configurations can be tested rapidly. We have extended an existing AI environment and created a script framework for implementing general-purpose AIs. Moreover, we have implemented software tools capable of generating script code for helping in the AI structure design and for simplifying the actual code-writing task.

From the results of this first study, we have developed an iPhone game for transmitting knowledge as part of multiculturalism, solidarity and tolerance following established learning theories, several design principles, and the objectives and competences of the Spanish law for primary education. We also report on a second study to determine whether the iPhone game has better learning outcomes than a traditional game by analyzing the participation of 84 children ranging in age from 8 to 10 years old. The frequency of playing with consoles or computer games was also taken into account in this second study, and the worldwide trend of previous studies has been corroborated. For learning outcomes, the results did not show significant differences between the two groups. However, 96% of the children indicated that they would like to play with the iPhone game again, and 90% indicated that they preferred the experience with the iPhone game over the traditional one. From these results, we can conclude that the children achieved similar knowledge improvements using both the autonomous game (iPhone game) and the custom, guided game (traditional game). This could facilitate versatility in the learning process since the learning activity could be performed at any place and time without requiring supervision.

Both experiments varied (a) proximal action-related information by either introducing or not introducing Turbulence into the mouse controls and (b) distal outcome-related information such that touched X's ""exploded"" either 100 or 75 % of the time. Both variables affected people's judgments of agency (JOAs), but the effect was different. First, the decrement in feelings of agency was greater with the proximal variable than with distal variable. Second, while the proximal variable always had a large direct effect on JOAs, even taking judgments of performance (JOPs) into account, JOPs completely accounted for the effect of the distal variable in Experiment 1, where the instructions were just to touch the X's. And even in Experiment 2, in which the instructions were to explode the X's, the direct effect of the distal variable on JOAs was small. These data indicate that these two cues exhibit different psychological profiles. The proximal action-related information is a diagnostic cue to agency indicating the match between one's own intentions and actions. Internal monitoring of intentions is necessary and so the self is implicated. However, distal outcome can be largely monitored using information external to the agent, and so-while it is used by people to make agency judgments-it is a non-diagnostic cue. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.",23358706,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84892815703

If this model is accurate, then human social exclusion should be utilized by females more than males and females should be more sensitive to its occurrence. Here we present four studies supporting this model. In Study 1, using a computerized game with fictitious opponents, we demonstrate that females are more willing than males to socially exclude a temporary ally. In Study 2, females report more actual incidents of social exclusion than males do. In Study 3, females perceive cues revealing social exclusion more rapidly than males do.

As hypothesized, when reappraising, decision acceptance rates were altered, with a greater number of unfair offers accepted while down-regulating and a greater number of unfair offers rejected while upregulating, both relative to the baseline condition. At the neural level, during reappraisal, significant activations were observed in the inferior and middle frontal gyrus (MFG), in addition to the medial prefrontal cortex and cingulate gyrus for unfair offers only. Regulated decisions involved left inferior frontal gyrus for upregulation and MFG for down-regulation strategies, respectively. Importantly, the effects of emotion modulation were evident in posterior insula, with less activation for down-regulation and more activation for upregulation in these areas.

It is not known if the APVG practice provides similar outcomes in subjects with spinal cord injury (SCI). Aim: Aim of the study was to evaluate cardio-pulmonary and metabolic adaptations during APVG practice and to find whether EE increase above resting condition could suggest the inclusion of this exercise in a more general strategy for health promotion and body weight control in subjects with SCI. Design: Repeated measures study. Setting: Rehabilitation Institute. Population: Ten male subjects with SCI (lesion levels from C7 to L1) age 26 to 55 years. Methods: We recorded pulmonary ventilation (VE), oxygen consumption (VO 2) for EE esteem and heart rate (HR) at rest and while playing virtual bowling, tennis and boxing games using a portable metabolimeter equipped with ECG electrodes. The standard metabolic equivalent of task (METs) was calculated offline. The metabolic and functional parameters were referred to the 10th minute of each activity. Results: Metabolic and functional parameters increased significantly from rest to bowling, tennis and boxing. METs exceeded in average 3 during boxing. One hour of APVG can increase daily EE by about 6% (bowling), 10% (tennis) and 15% (boxing). Conclusion: These considerable results suggest that physical exertion during APVG practice in subjects with SCI could contribute to health promotion as well as caloric balance control, especially when boxing is considered. This can be safely achieved at home with regular activity.

Ten years later, that vision is coming closer to reality. Having overcome the high costs and poor accuracy that once stunted its growth, one form of biometric technology-facial recognition-is quickly moving out of the realm of science fiction and into the commercial marketplace. Today, companies are deploying facial recognition technologies in a wide array of contexts, reflecting a spectrum of increasing technological sophistication. At the simplest level, the technology can be used for facial detection; that is, merely to detect and locate a face in a photo. Current uses of facial detection include refining search engine results to include only those results that contain a face; locating faces in images in order to blur them; ensuring that the frame for a video chat feed actually includes a face; or developing virtual eyeglass fitting systems and virtual makeover tools that allow consumers to upload their photos online and ""try on"" a pair of glasses or a new hairstyle. A more refined version of facial recognition technology allows companies to assess characteristics of facial images. For instance, companies can identify moods or emotions from facial expressions to determine a player's engagement with a video game or a viewer's excitement during a movie. Companies can also place cameras into digital signs to determine the demographic characteristics of a face-such as age range and gender-and deliver targeted advertisements in real-time in retail spaces. In the most advanced application, companies can use the technology to compare individuals' facial characteristics across different images in order to identify them. In this application, an image of an individual is matched with another image of the same individual. If the face in either of the two images is identified-that is, the name of the individual is known-then, in addition to being able to demonstrate a match between two faces, the technology can be used to identify previously anonymous faces. This is the use of facial recognition that potentially raises the most serious privacy concerns because it can identify anonymous individuals in images. One prevalent current use of this application is to enable semi-automated photo tagging or photo organization on social networks and in photo management applications. On social networks this feature typically works by scanning new photos a user uploads against existing ""tagged"" photos. The social network then identifies the user's ""friends"" in the new photos so the user can tag them. On December 8, 2011, the Federal Trade Commission (""FTC"" or ""Commission"") hosted a workshop-""Face Facts: A Forum on Facial Recognition Technology"" (""Face Facts workshop"")-to explore developments in this rapidly evolving field. Panelists discussed a number of issues, including: recent advances in facial recognition technologies; current and possible future commercial uses of facial recognition technologies; ways consumers can benefit from these uses; and privacy and security concerns raised. Following the workshop, the FTC received eighty public comments discussing these issues from private citizens, industry representatives, trade groups, consumer and privacy advocates, think tanks, and members of Congress. In this report, FTC staff has synthesized those discussions and comments in order to develop recommended best practices for protecting consumer privacy in this area, while promoting innovation. To begin, staff recommends that companies using facial recognition technologies design their services with privacy in mind, that is, by implementing ""privacy by design,"" in a number of ways. First, companies should maintain reasonable data security protections for consumers' images and the biometric information collected from those images to enable facial recognition (for example, unique measurements such as size of features or distance between the eyes or the ears). As the increasing public availability of identified images online has been a major factor in the increasing commercial viability of facial recognition technologies, companies that store such images should consider putting protections in place that would prevent unauthorized scraping which can lead to unintended secondary uses. Second, companies should establish and maintain appropriate retention and disposal practices for the consumer images and biometric data that they collect. For example, if a consumer creates an account on a website that allows her to virtually ""try on"" eyeglasses, uploads photos to that website, and then later deletes her account on the website, the photos are no longer necessary and should be discarded. Third, companies should consider the sensitivity of information when developing their facial recognition products and services. For instance, companies developing digital signs equipped with cameras using facial recognition technologies should consider carefully where to place such signs and avoid placing them in sensitive areas, such as bathrooms, locker rooms, health care facilities, or places where children congregate. Staff also recommends several ways for companies using facial recognition technologies to provide consumers with simplified choices and increase the transparency of their practices. For example, companies using digital signs capable of demographic detection-which often look no different than digital signs that do not contain cameras-should provide clear notice to consumers that the technologies are in use, before consumers come into contact with the signs. Similarly, social networks using a facial recognition feature should provide users with a clear notice-outside of a privacy policy-about how the feature works, what data it collects, and how it will use the data. Social networks should also provide consumers with (1) an easy to find, meaningful choice not to have their biometric data collected and used for facial recognition; and (2) the ability to turn off the feature at any time and delete any biometric data previously collected from their tagged photos. Finally, there are at least two scenarios in which companies should obtain consumers' affirmative express consent before collecting or using biometric data from facial images. First, they should obtain a consumer's affirmative express consent before using a consumer's image or any biometric data derived from that image in a materially different manner than they represented when they collected the data. Second, companies should not use facial recognition to identify anonymous images of a consumer to someone who could not otherwise identify him or her, without obtaining the consumer's affirmative express consent. Consider the example of a mobile app that allows users to identify strangers in public places, such as on the street or in a bar. If such an app were to exist, a stranger could surreptitiously use the camera on his mobile phone to take a photo of an individual who is walking to work or meeting a friend for a drink and learn that individual's identity-and possibly more information, such as her address-without the individual even being aware that her photo was taken. Given the significant privacy and safety risks that such an app would raise, only consumers who have affirmatively chosen to participate in such a system should be identified. The recommended best practices contained in this report are intended to provide guidance to commercial entities that are using or plan to use facial recognition technologies in their products and services. However, to the extent the recommended best practices go beyond existing legal requirements, they are not intended to serve as a template for law enforcement actions or regulations under laws currently enforced by the FTC. If companies consider the issues of privacy by design, meaningful choice, and transparency at this early stage, it will help ensure that this industry develops in a way that encourages companies to offer innovative new benefits to consumers and respect their privacy interests. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Previous work has probed social norm violations and the feelings that such violations engender; however, a computational rendering of the underlying neural and emotional responses has been lacking. We probed norm violations using a two-party, repeated fairness game (ultimatum game) where proposers offer a split of a monetary resource to a responder who either accepts or rejects the offer. Using a norm-training paradigm where subject groups are preadapted to either high or low offers, we demonstrate that unpredictable shifts in expected offers creates a difference in rejection rates exhibited by the two responder groups for otherwise identical offers. We constructed an ideal observer model that identified neural correlates of norm prediction errors in the ventral striatum and anterior insula, regions that also showed strong responses to variance-prediction errors generated by the same model. Subjective feelings about offers correlated with these norm prediction errors, and the two signals displayed overlapping, but not identical, neural correlates in striatum, insula, and medial orbito-frontal cortex. These results provide evidence for the hypothesis that responses in anterior insula can encode information about social norm violations that correlate with changes in overt behavior (changes in rejection rates). Together, these results demonstrate that the brain regions involved in reward prediction and risk prediction are also recruited in signaling social norm violations. © 2013 the authors.",23325247,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84872326470

Currently there is insufficient experimental evidence about how extended video-game play may affect adolescents' sleep. The aim of this study was to investigate the shortterm impact of adolescents' prolonged exposure to violent video-gaming on sleep. Seventeen male adolescents (mean age = 16 ± 1 years) with no current sleep difficulties played a novel, fast-paced, violent videogame (50 or 150 min) before their usual bedtime on two different testing nights in a sleep laboratory. Objective (polysomnography-measured sleep and heart rate) and subjective (single-night sleep diary) measures were obtained to assess the arousing effects of prolonged gaming. Compared with regular gaming, prolonged gaming produced decreases in objective sleep efficiency (by 7 ± 2%, falling below 85%) and total sleep time (by 27 ± 12 min) that was contributed by a near-moderate reduction in rapid eye movement sleep (Cohen's d = 0.48). Subjective sleep-onset latency significantly increased by 17 ± 8 min, and there was a moderate reduction in self-reported sleep quality after prolonged gaming (Cohen's d = 0.53). Heart rate did not differ significantly between video-gaming conditions during pre-sleep game-play or the sleep-onset phase. Results provide evidence that prolonged video-gaming may cause clinically significant disruption to adolescent sleep, even when sleep after video-gaming is initiated at normal bedtime. However, physiological arousal may not necessarily be the mechanism by which technology use affects sleep. © 2012 European Sleep Research Society.",23137332,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84880149917

METHODS: Thirty boys (aged 13-16 years, standard deviation = 0.9), half of them low-exposed (≤1 h/d) and half high-exposed (≥3 h/d) to violent games, played a VG/NVG for 2 hours during two different evenings in their homes. Heart rate (HR) and HR variability were registered from before start until next morning. A questionnaire about emotional reactions was administered after gaming sessions and a sleep diary on the following mornings. RESULTS: During sleep, there were significant interaction effects between group and gaming condition for HR (means [standard errors] for low-exposed: NVG 63.8 [2.2] and VG 67.7 [2.4]; for high-exposed: NVG 65.5 [1.9] and VG 62.7 [1.9]; F(1,28) = 9.22, p = .005).

Many violent video games can be stressful because enemies are trying to kill players. The present study investigates whether violent games increase aggression by inducing stress in players. Stress was measured using cardiac coherence, defined as the synchronization of the rhythm of breathing to the rhythm of the heart. We predicted that cardiac coherence would mediate the link between exposure to violent video games and subsequent aggression. Specifically, we predicted that playing a violent video game would decrease cardiac coherence, and that cardiac coherence, in turn, would correlate negatively with aggression. Participants (N = 77) played a violent or nonviolent video game for 20 min. Cardiac coherence was measured before and during game play. After game play, participants had the opportunity to blast a confederate with loud noise through headphones during a reaction time task. The intensity and duration of noise blasts given to the confederate was used to measure aggression. As expected, violent video game players had lower cardiac coherence levels and higher aggression levels than did nonviolent game players. Cardiac coherence, in turn, was negatively related to aggression. This research offers another possible reason why violent games can increase aggression-by inducing stress. Cardiac coherence can be a useful tool to measure stress induced by violent video games. Cardiac coherence has several desirable methodological features as well: it is noninvasive, stable against environmental disturbances, relatively inexpensive, not subject to demand characteristics, and easy to use. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",23097053,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84872662915

For instance, high-anxious individuals are more likely to avoid such social interactions as communicating with strangers. In this study, we investigate the impact of anxiety on social decision-making. The classic ultimatum game (UG) paradigm was utilized in concert with skin conductance recording. Behavioral results reveal that when playing as responders, high-trait anxiety (HTA) participants with lower levels of self-esteem, as well as low-trait anxiety (LTA) participants with higher levels of impulsivity, were more likely to accept human-proposed inequitable offers. In addition, the HTA participants rejected more computer-proposed inequitable offers than did LTA participants. Moreover, the skin conductance response to inequitable offers was correlated with levels of anxiety in the HTA group, but not in the LTA group. In conclusion, people differing in levels of anxiety showed distinct behavior patterns and autonomic neural responses during social decision-making, whereas the levels of self-esteem, impulsivity, and depression might be additional moderating factors.

The dynamics of this affective model are also analyzed using Lewis's dynamic theory of emotions. Evidences of phase transitions suggested by Lewis are observed in simulations, including trigger, self-amplification and self-stabilization phases.

The aim was to examine the association between time engaged in television (TV) viewing or playing with videogames and a clustered cardio-metabolic risk in adolescents. Methods and results: Sedentary behaviours and physical activity were assessed in 769 adolescents (376 boys, aged 12.5-17.5 years) from the HELENA-CSS study. We measured systolic blood pressure, HOMA index, triglycerides, TC/HDL-c, VO2max and the sum of four skinfolds, and a clustered metabolic risk index was computed. A multilevel regression model (by Poisson) was performed to calculate the prevalence ratio of having a clustered metabolic risk. In boys, playing &gt;4h/day with videogames (weekend) and moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) was associated with cardio-metabolic risk after adjustment for age, maternal education and MVPA. In contrast, TV viewing was not associated with the presence of cardio-metabolic risk. Conclusion: In boys, playing with videogames may impair cardio-metabolic health during the adolescence. Adolescents should be encouraged to increase their participation in physical activity of at least moderate intensity to obtain a more favourable risk factor profile. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",22906564,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84886290970

In substance-related addiction, attentional bias and cue reactivity are often observed. We conducted a functional magnetic resonance study using a dot probe paradigm with short-presentation (attentional bias) and long-presentation (cue reactivity) trials in eight male pathological computer game players (PCGPs) and nine healthy controls (HCs). Computer game-related and neutral computer-generated pictures, as well as pictures from the International Affective Picture System with positive and neutral valence, served as stimuli. PCGPs showed an attentional bias toward both game-related and affective stimuli with positive valence. In contrast, HCs showed no attentional bias effect at all. PCGPs showed stronger brain responses in short-presentation trials compared with HCs in medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and anterior cingulate gyrus and in long-presentation trials in lingual gyrus. In an exploratory post hoc functional connectivity analyses, for long-presentation trials, connectivity strength was higher between right inferior frontal gyrus, which was associated with inhibition processing in previous studies, and cue reactivity-related regions (left orbitofrontal cortex and ventral striatum) in PCGPs. We observed behavioral and neural effects in PCGPs, which are comparable with those found in substance-related addiction.

We computed signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of SSVEPs and used partial least squares regression to model hit rates, SNRs and their relationship at 3 Hz and 8.6 Hz. The following are the most significant results: RPG players' parietal responses to the attended 8.6 Hz flicker were predictive of hit rate and were positively correlated with it, indicating attentional signal enhancement. FPS players' parietal responses to the ignored 3 Hz flicker were predictive of hit rate and were positively correlated with it, indicating distractor suppression. Consistent with these parietal responses, RPG players' frontal responses to the attended 8.6 Hz flicker, increased as task difficulty increased with number of regions; FPS players' frontal responses to the ignored 3 Hz flicker increased with number of regions. Thus the FPS players appear to employ an active suppression mechanism to deploy selective attention simultaneously to multiple interleaved regions, while RPG primarily use signal enhancement. These results suggest that fast-action gaming can affect neural strategies and the corresponding networks underlying attention, presumably by training mechanisms of distractor suppression. © 2012 The Author(s).",22614909,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84872295020

Twenty healthy adults (aged 61±6 years) took part in a single session using a selection of the Wii Sports and Wii Fit games. During the gameplay session, heart rate and perceived exertion were measured. Pre-and post-session, we investigated mood using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) and cognitive function (i.e. aptitude, abstract reasoning and problem solving) using the test of non-verbal intelligence (TONI-IQ) and trail B tests. We also gathered subjective feedback from participants using semi-structured interviews and questionnaires. Three of the game activities (hula-hoop, rowing squat and leg extension) were identified to reach a moderate level of heart rate intensity, with one activity (jogging) corresponding to a vigorous level. We identified that post-session PANAS-positive subscale scores were greater than pre-session scores (P&lt;0.01). There was a reduction in the time to complete the TONI-IQ test from pre-to post-session (P&lt;0.05). Findings from these data identify that some Wii activities were of an intensity required for health benefits; a single Wii activity session can result in positive mood changes and the Wii interface is generally acceptable and appropriate for this older age adult group.

However, regret and disappointment are also characterized by differential agency attribution: personal agency for regret, external agency for disappointment. In this study, we investigate the neural correlates of these two characterizations of regret and disappointment using magnetoencephalography (MEG). To do this, we experimentally induced each emotion by manipulating feedback (chosen gamble vs. unchosen gamble), agency (human vs. computer choice) and outcomes (win vs. loss) in a fully randomized design. At the behavioral level the emotional experience of regret and disappointment were indeed affected by both feedback and agency manipulations. These emotions also differentially affect subsequent choices, with regret leading to riskier behavior. At the neural level both feedback and agency affected the brain responses associated with regret and disappointment, demonstrating differential localization in the brain for each. Notably, feedback regret showed greater brain activity in the right anterior and posterior regions, with agency regret producing greater activity in the left anterior region.

Initially, it has been studied for video game players, but the effect has recently been cited across various disciplines. Flow can occur when there is the right balance between the challenge [C] of a task and the corresponding skill set [S] of the individual performing the task. Recent research findings shed light on how to balance these two factors and create optimal flow conditions in the workplace. The findings translate into management tools that provide an atmosphere which encourages high engagement and performance. Flow is also a highly energized state where senses and emotions are in full alignment with the task that is carried out. A motivational framework therefore needs to take a second dimension into account. It has to balance the workload [WL] of an employee and his/her capacity to work [CW], thus ensuring that the mid-term and long-term effectiveness of employees is maintained. Pushing employees down an energy-depleting path can quickly lead to a drop in performance or even fatigue or burn-out. Instead, organizations need to apply strategies to leverage wellsprings and effectively reenergize their workforce. Balancing the Big 4 factors challenge [C] vs. skill [S], and workload [WL] vs. capacity to work [CW], are the centerpiece of the resulting new framing of employee motivation.

Less than 30% of out-of-hospital victims receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) despite the American Heart Association training over 12 million laypersons annually to conduct CPR. New engaging learning methods are needed for CPR education, especially in schools. Massively multiplayer virtual worlds (MMVW) offer platforms for serious games that are promising learning methods that take advantage of the computer capabilities of today's youth (ie, the digital native generation). Objective: Our main aim was to assess the feasibility of cardiopulmonary resuscitation training in high school students by using avatars in MMVM. We also analyzed experiences, self-efficacy, and concentration in response to training. Methods: In this prospective international collaborative study, an e-learning method was used with high school students in Sweden and the United States. A software game platform was modified for use as a serious game to train in emergency medical situations. Using MMVW technology, participants in teams of 3 were engaged in virtual-world scenarios to learn how to treat victims suffering cardiac arrest. Short debriefings were carried out after each scenario. A total of 36 high school students (Sweden, n=12; United States, n=24) participated. Their self-efficacy and concentration (task motivation) were assessed. An exit questionnaire was used to solicit experiences and attitudes toward this type of training. Among the Swedish students, a follow-up was carried out after 6 months. Depending on the distributions, t tests or Mann-Whitney tests were used. Correlation between variables was assessed by using Spearman rank correlation. Regression analyses were used for time-dependent variables. Results: The participants enjoyed the training and reported a self-perceived benefit as a consequence of training. The mean rating for self-efficacy increased from 5.8/7 (SD 0.72) to 6.5/7 (SD 0.57, P<.001). In the Swedish follow-up, it subsequently increased from 5.7/7 (SD 0.56) to 6.3/7 (SD 0.38, P=.006). In the Swedish group, the mean concentration value increased from 52.4/100 (SD 9.8) to 62.7/100 (SD 8.9, P=.05); in the US group, the concentration value increased from 70.8/100 (SD 7.9) to 82.5/100 (SD 4.7, P<.001). We found a significant positive correlation (P<.001) between self-efficacy and concentration scores. Overall, the participants were moderately or highly immersed and the software was easy to use. Conclusions: By using online MMVWs, team training in CPR is feasible and reliable for this international group of high school students (Sweden and United States). A high level of appreciation was reported among these adolescents and their self-efficacy increased significantly. The described training is a novel and interesting way to learn CPR teamwork, and in the future could be combined with psychomotor skills training. © Filippo Castiglione.",23318253,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84877286682

However, little is known about the neural process that underpins human reciprocity during social interactions. Our neuroimaging study manipulated partner identity (computer, human) and strategy (random, tit-for-tat) in repeated prisoner's dilemma games and investigated the neural correlate of reciprocal interaction with humans. Reciprocal cooperation with humans but exploitation of computers by defection was associated with activation in the left amygdala. Amygdala activation was also positively and negatively correlated with a preference change for human partners following tit-for-tat and random strategies, respectively. The correlated activation represented the intensity of positive feeling toward reciprocal and negative feeling toward non-reciprocal partners, and so reflected reciprocity in social interaction. Reciprocity in social interaction, however, might plausibly be misinterpreted and so we also examined the neural coding of insight into the reciprocity of partners. Those with and without insight revealed differential brain activation across the reward-related circuitry (i.e., the right middle dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and dorsal caudate) and theory of mind (ToM) regions [i.e., ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) and precuneus]. Among differential activations, activation in the precuneus, which accompanied deactivation of the VMPFC, was specific to those without insight into human partners who were engaged in a tit-for-tat strategy. This asymmetric (de)activation might involve specific contributions of ToM regions to the human search for reciprocity. Consequently, the intensity of emotion attached to human reciprocity was represented in the amygdala, whereas insight into the reciprocity of others was reflected in activation across the reward-related and ToM regions. This suggests the critical role of mentalizing, which was not equated with reward expectation during social interactions. © 2013 Sakaiya, Shiraito, Kato, Ide, Okada, Takano and Kansaku.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84898038791

This implies an autonomous developmental process for skills in which a skill-acquisition goal is first identified, then a skill is learned to solve the goal. The learned skill may then be stored, reused, temporarily ignored or even permanently erased. This paper formalizes the developmental process for skills by proposing a goal-lifecycle using the option framework for motivated reinforcement learning agents. The paper shows how the goal-lifecycle can be used as a basis for designing motivational state-spaces that permit agents to reason introspectively and autonomously about when to learn skills to solve goals, when to activate skills, when to suspend activation of skills or when to delete skills. An algorithm is presented that simultaneously learns: 1) an introspective policy mapping motivational states to decisions that change the agent's motivational state, and 2) multiple option policies mapping sensed states and actions to achieve various domain-specific goals. Two variations of agents using this model are compared to motivated reinforcement learning agents without introspection for controlling non-player characters in a computer game scenario. Results show that agents using introspection can focus their attention on learning more complex skills than agents without introspection. In addition, they can learn these skills more effectively. © 2009-2011 IEEE.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871094570

The obesity epidemic leads to several life threatening conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, and mental health problems like depression, anxiety, and loneliness just to mention a few. Several approaches, including physical exercises, strict diet, and exergames among others, have been adopted to address the obesity epidemic. Exergames are considered the innovative approach for fighting several health problems such as obesity, where a combination of exercise and 3-D gaming are proposed to incite kids to exercise as a team. Collaborative exergaming became even more popular given that it addresses the social side of the obesity epidemic, and it motivates kids to socialize with other kids. Traditional exergames are based on the client-server approach where the server is responsible for streaming the 3-D environment. However, this can lead to latency and server bottleneck if many clients participate in the exergame, which leads to the kids stopping exercising. Having an exergame application that does not suffer from networking problem such as delay, is very important given that it increases the exercise hours. In this paper, we propose a new trend of mobile collaborative exergaming applications that is based on the peer-to-peer architecture, as well as two supplying partner selection protocols that aim at selecting the suitable source responsible for streaming the relevant 3-D data. Our system, that we refer to as MOSAIC, is intended for mobile collaborative exergames that incite kids to move inside a large area, using thin mobile devices such as head-mounted devices, have physical exercises, and collaborate with other kids which in consequence address several health problems such as the obesity epidemic on the physical and social plans. Our proposed mobile collaborative exergame aims at inciting the kids to exercise as a team for a longer time by improving the quality of the streaming and reducing the delay. This is accomplished by our proposed supplying partner selection protocols that provide a quick discovery of multiple supplying partners, by minimizing the time required to acquire the data. The performance evaluation that we have obtained to evaluate our suite of protocols using a realistic set of exergame scenarios for obese kids is then presented and discussed. © 1997-2012 IEEE.",22752144,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84870888811

Specifically, the study was designed to examine whether these games elicit desensitization, facilitation, and disinhibition. Thus, does physiological arousal in response to violent activity decrease over time during game play, and is there a difference between novice and experienced game players (as would be expected if desensitization had occurred)? Do players experience positive emotional states when actively engaged in virtual violent behavior (fighting and killing opponents) - a necessary condition for disinhibition? Do game players frame their motivations in terms of self-defense and game success, as would be necessary for facilitation to occur? The results showed that playing first-person shooters did elicit these requisite patterns of cognitive, physiological, and emotional states. Violent game play is a positive, arousing, present, dominant experience, as required for disinhibition and facilitation. Experienced game players are less aroused than less experienced game players (as required for desensitization). Further, during a game-playing session, exploring and searching for enemies become less arousing, while fighting and killing become more arousing over time (as required by desensitization and facilitation). © 2012 Hogrefe Publishing.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84877301903

Computer-mediated training for crew commanders should provide a sensory experience that is sufficiently intense to make the training viable and effective. In practice, sound is an important source of information for firefighters. During an evaluation of a soundless computer-mediated and instructor in-the-loop virtual training, both trainees and instructors frequently remarked that the lack of sound made the simulation less convincing and engaging. Research on entertainment games has shown that users may experience higher levels of presence, engagement, and arousal when sound is included in the simulations. The authors therefore hypothesized that the addition of task-relevant (informative) sounds to a virtual training would raise the engagement and arousal of the users, and the overall convincingness of the simulation. In this study, they included verisimilar and task-relevant sounds in an instructor in-the-loop computer-mediated firefighter training and assessed how these sounds affect user experience. In contrast to the common belief of trainees and instructors, the authors find that merely adding task-relevant sounds does not necessarily increase the engagement and arousal of the users. The authors conclude that the physical presence of (and verbal communication with) the instructor probably distracted from the simulation, and an integral sound design involving mediated communication with a remotely present instructor may be required to resolve this problem. © 2012 SAGE Publications.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871181130

In the recent academic excitement surrounding game studies, the music of games has been overshadowed. The author would like to call attention to the significance of game music and to consider a rhetorical method to approaching it that calls upon a rekindling of the history of coupling rhetoric with music. The author builds on this history by suggesting the foundation of a rhetorical framework for understanding the argumentative power of video game songs. He then moves to offer an approach for evaluating the ethos of game music that consists of assessing worlds and how they are carried through, and by, music. While 17th century baroque composers thought music to be fundamentally an issue of affections-and especially played off of emotional binaries such as joy/sadness as a rhetorical approach-the author hope to here revive this lost art of applying rhetoric to music through broadening the discussion beyond the matter of human emotion. This rhetorical approach allows the individual a framework with which to evaluate the ethos of game music as it now appears through numerous mobile operating systems, online environments, and as remediated forms manifesting in/as cultural artifacts.

A perceptual skill that is fundamental to effective social communication is the ability to accurately perceive and interpret facial emotions. To evaluate the expression processing of participants with ASD, we designed the Let's Face It! Emotion Skills Battery (LFI! Battery), a computer-based assessment composed of three subscales measuring verbal and perceptual skills implicated in the recognition of facial emotions. Methods: We administered the LFI! Battery to groups of participants with ASD and typically developing control (TDC) participants that were matched for age and IQ. Results: On the Name Game labeling task, participants with ASD (N = 68) performed on par with TDC individuals (N = 66) in their ability to name the facial emotions of happy, sad, disgust and surprise and were only impaired in their ability to identify the angry expression. On the Matchmaker Expression task that measures the recognition of facial emotions across different facial identities, the ASD participants (N = 66) performed reliably worse than TDC participants (N = 67) on the emotions of happy, sad, disgust, frighten and angry. In the Parts-Wholes test of perceptual strategies of expression, the TDC participants (N = 67) displayed more holistic encoding for the eyes than the mouths in expressive faces whereas ASD participants (N = 66) exhibited the reverse pattern of holistic recognition for the mouth and analytic recognition of the eyes. Conclusion: In summary, findings from the LFI! Battery show that participants with ASD were able to label the basic facial emotions (with the exception of angry expression) on par with age- and IQ-matched TDC participants. However, participants with ASD were impaired in their ability to generalize facial emotions across different identities and showed a tendency to recognize the mouth feature holistically and the eyes as isolated parts. © 2012 The Authors.

The term ""biofeedback"" was coined in late 1969 to describe laboratory procedures (developed in the 1940's) that trained research subjects to alter brain activity, blood pressure, muscle tension, heart rate and other bodily functions that are not normally controlled voluntarily. Although most people initially viewed these practices with skepticism, researchers proved that many individuals could alter their involuntary responses by ""feeding back"" information either visually or audibly to show what was occurring in their bodies. Today, research has demonstrated that biofeedback can help in the treatment of many diseases and painful conditions. BF techniques applied to vision are still being studied for both their methodological and physiological aspects. Giorgi, Contestabile, and Vingolo et al. have proposed different visual rehabilitation techniques and instruments using biofeedback strategies starting from basic systems like an Accomotrack Vision Trainer (which is a high- speed infrared optometer which records the vergence of light reflected from the retina at a rate of 40 Hz, then converts the signal into an auditory tone which increases in pitch and rate as accommodation decreases; the subject listens to the tone and thus receives immediate auditory feedback as to his/ her accommodative status) or improved biofeedback integrated system (IBIS) devices, merging to more complex instruments as the fundus related MP-1 microperimeter (Nidek Technologies, Padua, Italy). Recently introduced techniques, such as microperimetry by a scanning laser ophthalmoscope (SLO), microperimetry together with the ongoing research targeting the neurophysiology, and neuro-modelling lead us to a better knowledge of the cognitive processes of rehabilitation and can also serve as a useful diagnostic as well as a therapeutic tool for the treatment of retinal disease. Visual training with visually evoked assisted biofeedback has been used to improve performance in high speed drivers and precision shooters. Computer programs for visual stimulation have been used to treat amblyopia, offering to shift the visual training into the domestic sphere. Several randomized control studies on vision training systems, consisting of a background stimulation by a drifting sinusoidal grating, combined with a foreground game aimed at maintaining attention have been reported in this field. Furthermore, visual training has also been used to improve the saccadic performance in dyslexic children with deficitary eye movement control. This indicates that daily practice improved not only perceptual capacity, but also voluntary saccade control within 3 to 8 weeks. After training, the group of dyslexics was no longer statistically different from the control group. This chapter aims to review the history, methodology and application of biofeedback techniques to vision. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Multilevel models assessed within- and between-person associations between time in each activity and cortisol area under the curve (AUC), cortisol awakening response (CAR), morning peak (30 minutes after wake up), and daily decline (morning peak to bedtime). Results: Links with AUC were found for most activities; significant associations with cortisol rhythms suggested that most effects were due to anticipation of the day's activities. Specifically, on days when youths spent more time than usual on video games and television, they had lower AUCs, with lower morning peaks. Youths who spent more time reading (within-person) and in computer-related activities (between-person) had higher AUCs, with stronger CARs (within-person). Youths who slept more had lower AUCs, with lower morning peaks on both the between- and within-person levels. Amounts of time spent in clubs, and for older adolescents in sports, were also linked to lower AUCs. Finally, youths who spent more time in school/schoolwork had lower average AUCs, but on days when youths spent more time than usual in school, they had higher AUCs, stronger CARs, and steeper daily declines. Conclusion: Beyond their known implications for psychological adjustment, youths' everyday activities are linked to stress physiology. © 2012 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.",23174474,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84869499256

Once initial score was partialled out, the best predictors were frontal alpha power and alpha and delta ERSPs, but not P300. By combining these predictors, we could explain about 50% of the learning rate variance and 10%-20% of the variance in transfer to other tasks using only pretraining EEG measures.

In this code a hybrid model is adopted, in which the time-consuming solvers are dealt with GPUs and the complex AMR data structure is manipulated by Central Processing Units (CPUs). The code is highly parallelized with the Hilbert space-filling curve method. These implementations allow us to resolve well desperate spatial scales that are associated with acoustic waves. We show that a localized velocity (gas pressure) pulse that is initially launched within a uniform and still medium triggers acoustic waves simultaneously with a vortex (an entropy mode). In a flowing medium, acoustic waves experience amplitude growth or decay, a scenario which depends on a location of the flow and relative direction of wave propagation.

Cognitive radio ad hoc networks (CRAHNs) constituted of autonomous wireless nodes are a natural fit for game theory-based modeling. The game theory-based model is particularly suitable for ""collaborative spectrum sensing"" where each cognitive radio senses the spectrum and shares the results with other nodes such that the targeted sensing accuracy is achieved. Spectrum sensing in CRAHNs, especially when used in emergency scenarios such as disaster management and military applications, needs to be not only accurate and resource efficient, but also adaptive to the changing number of users as well as signal-to-noise ratios. In addition, spectrum sensing mechanism must also be proactive, fair, and tolerant to security attacks. Existing work in collaborative spectrum sensing has mostly been confined to resource efficiency in static systems using request-based reactive sensing resulting in high latencies. In this paper, evolutionary game theory (EGT) is used to model the behavior of the emergency CRAHNS, providing an efficient model for collaborative spectrum sensing. The resulting implementation model is adaptive to the changes in its environment such as signal-to-noise ratio and number of users in the network.

Most healthy decision-makers have the foresighted choicepattern. Namely, healthy subjects prefer advantageous decks to disadvantageous decks after the second block (about trials 21-40) in the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) (Damasio,1994; Bechara et al., 1999). Conversely, the patients with ventromedial prefrontal lesions possess the myopic decision pattern. However, an increasing number of studies have identified the prominent deck B (PDB) phenomenon, indicating that normal decision-makers have myopic choice behavior in the IGT. Normal subjects have difficulty avoiding disadvantageous deck B, even when near game end. Nevertheless, most IGT-related studies, including those of the Iowa group, subtracted bad decks from good decks (the two-category format) when presenting experimental data. Consequently, the incidence of the PDB phenomenon was not accurately assessed. Here we provided an empirical study which contains a complex and simple version of IGT to illustrate the PDB phenomenon. Methods: Two computer versions of IGT (concurrent (cIGT) vs. net-value (nIGT) are utilized to determine whether healthy decision-makers start shifting their preference from bad decks to good decks after the second block (about trials 21-40). In total, 48 gender-balanced subjects participated in this experiment. Each subject played only thecIGT or the nIGT. In total, 300 trials for each IGT version were utilized to identify the extended preferences of subjects. Results: A few studies presented data acquired using the four-deck format, providing clear experimental results for each deck that verify that the PDB phenomenon exists. Additionally, empirical results obtained by this study indicate that the two-category format identified a turning point for preferences during the second block (about trials 21-40) in both IGT versions. However, the PDB phenomenon existed in most stages of both IGT versions; namely, most healthy decision-makers avoided bad deck A, and had difficultly avoiding bad deck B. Conclusions: The present research indicates that the PDB phenomenon probably exists in most IGT related studies. Different presentation methods (two categories vs. four decks) can result in entirely different explanations of IGT decision behavior. Empiricaldata demonstrate that in both IGT versions, the PDB phenomenon existed, (Lin et al., 2007), which is counter to the basic IGT assumption that decks are chosen based on long-term outcome, even under an extended number of trials. This empirical finding indicates that players have a myopic view of long-term outcome in the IGT. © 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

We address this issue by comparing self-reported emotion ratings to observed emotion ratings and look at how differences between these two types of ratings affect the development and performance of automatic emotion recognizers developed with these ratings. A dimensional approach to emotion modeling is adopted: the ratings are based on continuous arousal and valence scales. We describe the TNO-Gaming Corpus that contains spontaneous vocal and facial expressions elicited via a multiplayer videogame and that includes emotion annotations obtained via self-report and observation by outside observers. Comparisons show that there are discrepancies between self-reported and observed emotion ratings which are also reflected in the performance of the emotion recognizers developed. Using Support Vector Regression in combination with acoustic and textual features, recognizers of arousal and valence are developed that can predict points in a 2-dimensional arousal-valence space. The results of these recognizers show that the self-reported emotion is much harder to recognize than the observed emotion, and that averaging ratings from multiple observers improves performance. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Design: Comparison study. Setting: Kirkby Sports College Centre for Learning, Liverpool, England. Participants: Eighteen schoolchildren (10 boys and 8 girls) aged 11 to 15 years. Main Exposure: A comparison of a traditional sedentary video game and 2 Kinect activity-promoting video games, Dance Central and Kinect Sports Boxing, each played for 15 minutes. Physiologic responses and energy expenditure were measured using a metabolic analyzer. Main Outcome Measures: Heart rate, oxygen uptake, and energy expenditure. Results: Heart rate, oxygen uptake, and energy expenditure were considerably higher (P &lt; .05) during activity-promoting video game play compared with rest and sedentary video game play. The mean (SD) corresponding oxygen uptake values for the sedentary, dance, and boxing video games were 6.1(1.3), 12.8(3.3), and 17.7(5.1) mL·min -1·kg-1, respectively.

Their judgements were largely inaccurate and based on their own emotions, suggesting limited emotion understanding. Experiment 2 explored if this could be overcome by making collaborators aware of each other's emotions. Co-located and remote collaborators played a cooperative puzzle-solving game under conditions of awareness or no awareness. Awareness was manipulated by making collaborators share their self-reported emotions during key moments of their game play. Both remote and co-located collaborators improved their performance after sharing their emotions.

Complementing the cognitive metaphorical interpretation, the visually represented emotive behaviors are theorized as partial iconic representations of real life behaviors, which are in turn indexes of emotion. Adopting a social semiotic approach, this paper formulates facial expression, touch, and body orientation as inter-related systems of meaning, the selection and combination of which constitutes a systemic functional ""lexico-grammar"" for analyzing and interpreting meaning making in visual imagery. The systems are then used to explain how emotive meanings are represented in comic books. The analysis shows that cartoonists' systemic choices for representing emotions are largely consistent with the coding accuracy of facial behaviors on the one hand, and style guidelines advocated in comic handbooks on the other. Through the examination of both American and Japanese comics, it is demonstrated that the social semiotic lexico-grammatical approach is not only effective in explaining the emotion resources in nonverbal behavior, but also useful for investigating cultural differences in the visual depiction of emotion. The systemic choices also provide artists with a framework to ""design"" emotion in creative visual media such as comics, and possibly in computer vision, game design and related domains. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84869866175

Initially, Team A bats to score some runs, while Team B balls. Then, Team A balls and Team B bats to overcome the score of Team A. If this happens, then Team B wins. Otherwise, Team A wins. The balling team can dismiss a batsman from scoring through a Run-Out, i.e.; the batsman fails to enter an area before three stumps are dislodged in that area. In this case, a third umpire makes the 'Run-Out/Not-Out' decision through video technology. This process can consume around one minute which disrupts the pace of the game. In this paper, we propose and validate a novel technology called A-Eye, which automates the role of the third umpire. By applying A-Eye to a set of autonomously-filmed Run-Out videos, we show that it is efficient as compared to the third umpire, and almost as accurate. Also, it can be used to estimate a rating for the field umpires.

While the literature suggests that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), striatum, and amygdala are involved in valuation-based DM and hippocampus in context processing, how these neural mechanisms subserve the integration of cognitive and emotional values in a social context remains unclear. In this study we addressed this gap by systematically manipulating cognition-emotion interaction in a social DM context, when the participants played a card game with a hypothetical opponent in a behavioral study (n = 73) and a functional magnetic-resonance-imaging study (n = 16). We observed that payoff-based behavioral choices were influenced by emotional values carried by face pictures and identified neurocircuits involved in cognitive valuation, emotional valuation, and concurrent cognition-emotion value integration. Specifically, while the vmPFC, amygdala, and ventral striatum were all involved in both cognitive and emotional domains of valuation, these regions played dissociable roles in social DM. The payoff-dependent responses in vmPFC and amygdala, but not ventral striatum, were moderated by the social context. Furthermore, the vmPFC, but not amygdala, not only encoded the opponent's gains as if self's losses, but also represented a ""final common currency"" during valuation-based decisions.

Life's stressful events and daily stresses cause both deleterious and cumulative effects on the human body. The practice of meditation might offer a way to relieve that stress. Objective The research team intended to study the effects of meditation on stress-induced changes in physiological parameters, cognitive functions, intelligence, and emotional quotients. Methods The research team conducted the study in two phases, with a month between them. Each participant served as his own control, and the first phase served as the control for the second phase. In phase 1, the research team studied the effects of a stressor (10 minutes playing a computer game) on participants' stress levels. In phase 2, the research team examined the effects of meditation on stress levels. Setting The research team conducted the study in a lab setting at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India. Participants The participants were 34 healthy, male volunteers who were students. Intervention To study the effects of long-term meditation on stress levels, intelligence, emotional quotients, and cognitive functions participants meditated daily for 1 month, between phases 1 and 2. To study the immediate effects of meditation on stress levels, participants meditated for 15 minutes after playing a computer game to induce stress. Outcome Measures The research team measured galvanic skin response (GSR), heart rate (HR), and salivary cortisol and administered tests for the intelligence and emotional quotients (IQ and EQ), acute and perceived stress (AS and PS), and cognitive functions (ie, the Sternberg memory test [short-term memory] and the Stroop test [cognitive flexibility]). Using a pre-post study design, the team performed this testing (1) prior to the start of the study (baseline); (2) in phase 1, after induced stress; (3) in part 1 of phase 2, after 1 month of daily meditation, and (4) in part 2 of phase 2, after induced stress, both before and after 15 minutes of meditation. Results Induced stress from the computer game resulted in a significant increase in physiological markers of stress such as GSR and HR. In the short term, meditation was associated with a physiological relaxation response (significant decrease in GSR) and an improvement in scores on the Stroop test of reaction times. In the long term, meditation brought significant improvements in IQ and scores for cognitive functions, whereas participants' stress levels (GSR and AS) decreased. EQ, salivary cortisol, and HR showed no significant changes. Conclusions The practice of meditation reduced psychological stress responses and improved cognitive functions, and the effects were pronounced with practice of meditation for a longer duration (1 month).",23251943,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84868708916

This so-called, ""competition effect"" has received inconsistent empirical support, suggesting that additional psychological (e.g., mood), situational (i.e., nature of the competition) and physiological (e.g., cortisol) variables might intervene in modulating testosterone fluctuations after social contests. We investigated possible interactions between the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) stress axis in predicting transient changes in testosterone after social victory or defeat on a familiar competitive task. In particular, the present study examined the dual-hormone hypothesis - proposing that baseline cortisol potently modulates the competition effect (Mehta and Josephs, 2010) - in a sample of healthy young men engaged in head-to-head competition on a widely played commercial videogame, Tetris. We found a significant interaction between HPG and HPA axes status and the competition effect on testosterone in the randomly assigned videogame winners, such that winners with a pre-competition combination of high baseline testosterone and low baseline cortisol exhibited significantly greater post-competition testosterone concentrations. The randomly assigned videogame losers showed significantly decreased post-competition levels of testosterone.

While systemic efforts are addressing health inequalities, there remains a need to demonstrate that persons with ID can increase their health self-advocacy skills. Method: A randomised control design with up to 6-month follow-up was used to evaluate the 3Rs (Rights, Respect and Responsibility) health self-advocacy training program for persons with ID (n=31). Training involved teaching participants to recognise and redress health rights violations in the context of respect and responsibility. Training materials included PowerPoint slides and interactive video scenarios illustrating health rights, respect and responsibility problem and non-problems. Two-hour training sessions were conducted twice a week in a group format where participants played a game and answered questions. Results: The health rights training group made significantly more correct responses on post training and follow-up tests than the control group.

We investigated whether WT is grounded on low-level selective attention or on higher level cognitive processes including differential weighting of evidence or response formation. Participants in our MRI study predicted the likelihood that their favorite or least favorite team would win a football game. Consistent with expectations, favorite team trials were characterized by higher winning odds. Our data demonstrated activity in a cluster comprising parts of the left inferior occipital and fusiform gyri to distinguish between favorite and least favorite team trials. More importantly, functional connectivities of this cluster with the human reward system were specifically involved in the type of WT investigated in our study, thus supporting the idea of an attention bias generating WT. Prefrontal cortex activity also distinguished between the two teams. However, activity in this region and its functional connectivities with the human reward system were altogether unrelated to the degree of WT reflected in the participants' behavior and may rather be related to social identification, ensuring the affective context necessary for WT to arise. © The Author (2011).

A technique for measuring the mental states of the human and associated applications based on normal brain signals are examined and evaluated firstly. Secondly, the virtual game starts with the information from the BCI and then it runs in the form of a thread, with the singleton design pattern as the main mode. Thirdly, through the synergistic cooperation with the main software, the virtual game can achieve quick and effective access to blood oxygen, heart rate and other physiological information of the patients. At the same time, by means of the hardware control system, the start-up of the gait rehabilitation training robot could be controlled accurately and effectively. Therefore, the plantar pressure information and the velocity information, together with the physiological information of the patients, would be properly reflected in the game lastly and the physical condition of the patients participating in rehabilitation training would also be reflected to a great extent. © 2012 Wang et al.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84868019558

Research question: The purpose of this laboratory-based study was to compare perceived exertion on the Nintendo Wii™ and two traditional modes of exercise: the treadmill and cycle ergometer. It was expected that the Wii™ would show lower ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) values. Type of study: A repeated measures design was used. Methods: Five healthy males (average age = 21.4 years) and seven females (average age = 22.1 years) completed three 20 minute exercise sessions in random order, one each using the cycle ergometer, the treadmill and the Nintendo Wii Fit Plus™. Exercise intensity was fixed at 65% (± 5 bpm) of each participant's age predicted maximum heart rate. Ratings of perceived exertion and HR were measured every minute.

Landmark detection is formulated as a game, in which landmarks are players, landmark candidate points are strategies, and likelihoods that candidate points represent landmarks are payoffs, determined according to the similarity of image intensities and spatial relationships between the candidate points in the target image and their corresponding landmarks in images from the training set. The solution of the formulated game-theoretic problem is the equilibrium of candidate points that represent landmarks in the target image and is obtained by a novel iterative scheme that solves the segmentation problem in polynomial time. The object boundaries are finally extracted by applying dynamic programming to the optimal path searching problem between the obtained adjacent landmarks. The performance of the proposed framework was evaluated for segmentation of lung fields from chest radiographs and heart ventricles from cardiac magnetic resonance cross sections. The comparison to other landmark-based segmentation techniques shows that the results obtained by the proposed game-theoretic framework are highly accurate and precise in terms of mean boundary distance and area overlap. Moreover, the framework overcomes several shortcomings of the existing techniques, such as sensitivity to initialization and convergence to local optima. © 2012 IEEE.",22692901,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867496657

In our work, we discuss a framework for implementing artificial game presenter characters that are based on game actions and players' social profiles in order to deliver knowledgeable, socially oriented comments. Moreover, the presented framework supports emotional facial expressions for the presenters, allowing them to convey their emotions and thus be more expressive than the majority of the commentary systems today.

Overuse is a concern, but it remains unclear whether problems arise from addictive patterns of use or simply excessive time spent on use. The goal of the present study was to evaluate computer/gaming station use in youth and to examine the relationship between amounts of use, addictive features of use and functional impairment. Method: A total of 110 subjects (11 to 17 years of age) from local schools participated. Time spent on television, video gaming and nongaming recreational computer activities was measured. Addictive features of computer/gaming station use were ascertained, along with emotional/behavioural functioning. Multiple linear regressions were used to understand how youth functioning varied with time of use and addictive features of use. Results: Mean (± SD) total screen time was 4.5±2.4 h/day. Addictive features of use were consistently correlated with functional impairment across multiple measures and informants, whereas time of use, after controlling for addiction, was not. Conclusions: Youth are spending many hours each day in front of screens. In the absence of addictive features of computer/gaming station use, time spent is not correlated with problems; however, youth with addictive features of use show evidence of poor emotional/behavioural functioning. ©2012 Pulsus Group Inc.

The pleasure offered by digital games may explain the players' consumption of this activity. Games may elicit both positive and negative emotions, which can be measured by encephalography (EEG). The EEG alpha asymmetry index (AI) is different in positive and negative emotions and so may be used to distinguish positive from negative emotions that occur during gaming. We hypothesized that the ""Counter-Strike"" (CS) game (Valve Software, Bellevue, WA) is pleasurable and demonstrable with a positive EEG AI. Subjects and Methods: Twelve male participants ages 18-30 years underwent EEG recordings continuously during and postgame. EEG was also recorded pregame for control conditions of baseline (sitting on a chair staring at a blank wall), movement (moving fingers on the computer keyboard with a blank screen), sound (listening to the sound of the CS game with a blank screen), and screen (watching the CS game without playing). Self-ratings of emotional responses were completed at pre-, during, and postgame. Results: A significant decrease in the EEG AI was observed under the screen condition compared with baseline, whereas an increase was observed postgame compared with the screen condition. The participants demonstrated a positive EEG AI following the ""shoot"" events (shoot opponents) and negative emotions after the ""being shot"" events. Subjective ratings of emotional response indicated happiness during and postgame, but anger and arousal were reported only during the game. Conclusions: The overall results are consistent with the hypothesis that predominantly positive emotional reactions are elicited from playing the CS game and concur with positive subjective ratings of happiness.

Thus, marketers need to consider the distinctive influences of various aspects of online reviews when launching new products and devising e-marketing strategies. Copyright © 2012 M.E. Sharpe, Inc.

All these roles call for intelligent bots that can give the player an engaging experience by adjusting and adapting to the players' style of play. They need to behave as actors in a virtual improvisational theatre. They need to perform in a manner that the player finds believable and engaging so that the player becomes sufficiently immersed in the interactive drama and keeps coming back for more. The bot's intelligence needs to be both robust to respond to player actions and sufficiently complex to handle character traits, emotions and complex decision making that resembles that of a human player. A balance needs to be maintained between the bots' believability and their entertainment value for the player, as these two goals may be at odds in some situations. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Additionally, other cognitive architectures used in video games are also analyzed. The bot codenamed CC-Bot2, winner of the 2K BotPrize 2010 competition and based on the CERA-CRANIUM cognitive architecture, is also described in this chapter. Specifically, the particular way in which CC-Bot2 processes the sensory-motor information and generates sequences of adaptive human-like actions is discussed. We also analyze the main differences between CC-Bot2 and other bots, focusing on the key features that allowed CC-Bot2 to win first place in the competition.

In this paper, we aim to take a first step toward answering this question. Such a question emerges from the fact that various studies have shown the dual role of body movement, i.e., a window on people's emotional and mental states as well as a means to affect people's cognitive and affective processes. In this paper, first, we investigate the possibility of automatically recognizing the emotional expressions conveyed by the player's body movement in a Nintendo sport game. Our results showed that our automatic recognition system achieved recognition rates comparable to human observers' benchmarks. Second, by taking a pragmatist definition of aesthetic experience into account, we argue that the tracked body expressions do not only express what the player may be feeling. Given their modulating role on cognition and affect, these body expressions also let the player actively construct and assign affective meanings to the unfolding of the game. We argue that the player's variety of emotional bodily expressions constitutes the emotional rhythmic dynamic of aesthetic experience and, as such, they provide a measure of its distinctive quality. © 2009-2012 IEEE.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866512354

It argues that a quasi-autonomous gaming culture was established in the mid-1980s, which established the perceptions and habits that make gaming possible and create the 'gamer' identity. The analysis shows a structural break associated with the introduction of the term 'gameplay' around March 1985, after which the appraisal of games takes on a limited independence from technical, educational and other normative criteria that get applied to other objects in the computer culture. The resulting discourse explains what is and can be meant by 'computer game' in our culture.

Participants played a computer game in which they had to learn whether previously unknown stimuli (i.e., beans) produced positive or negative outcomes. They then had to classify novel stimuli, which varied in resemblance to those employed in the game, as either positive or negative. Attitude generalization, i.e., the extent to which participants weight resemblance to a positive versus negative, is critical to the classification of these novel stimuli, which provided the basis for indexing valence weighting. Participants then completed a stressful anagram task, in which they had three minutes to solve as many anagrams as possible. Half the anagrams were difficult, and half were insoluble, thus creating a failure experience. Mood was assessed before and after the task as a measure of emotional reactivity. In two studies, we observed that for participants initially in a good mood, the extent to which negative attitudes generalized more extensively than positive attitudes was predictive of greater emotional reactivity to the stressful anagram task. © 2012 Guilford Publications, Inc.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866010312

Behavioral research has demonstrated that various cognitive processes can be influenced by conceptual representations implicitly primed during a preceding and unrelated task. Here we investigated whether emotion processing might also be influenced by prior incidental exposure to negative semantic material and which neural substrates would mediate these effects. During a first (priming) task, participants performed a variant of the hangman game with either negative or neutral emotion-laden words. Subsequently, they performed a second, unrelated visual task with fearful and neutral faces presented at attended or unattended locations. Participants were generally not aware of any relationships between the two tasks. We found that priming with emotional words enhanced amygdala sensitivity to faces in the subsequent visual task, while decreasing discriminative responses to threat. Furthermore, the magnitude of the induced bias in behavior and amygdala activation was predicted by the effectiveness of semantic access observed in the priming task. This demonstrates that emotional processing can be modulated by implicit influence of environmental information processed at an earlier time, independently of volitional control. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",22691615,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863527118

We developed gaming technology that encourages forced expiratory maneuvers. OBJECTIVE: Following interviews regarding recreational activities and subjects' practice of ACTs, we conducted a pilot trial of spirometer games in 13 adolescents with CF, to test the hypothesis that games could increase subjects' engagement with forced expiratory breathing maneuvers and improve pulmonary function tests (PFTs). METHODS: After baseline PFTs, subjects were provided with digital spirometers and computers set up as ""game only"" or ""control"" devices. After the first of 2 periods (each &gt; 2 weeks), the computer was set-up for the alternate condition for period 2. The t test and non-parametric correlation analyses examined use, number of expiratory high flow events (HFEs), and change in PFTs, identifying trends at P &lt; 1, significance at P &lt; 05. RESULTS: Interviews disclosed minimal awareness of ACTs among our pediatric CF patients. Subjects used games and control software a similar percentage of days during the game (26%) and control periods (32%). There was a trend toward more minutes with the game versus control setup (P = 07), though HFE count did not differ between the 2 conditions (P = 71). Game play showed no overall effect on FEV1, though correlation analysis showed a modest relation between minutes of play and change in FEV1 from baseline (r = 0.50, P = 09). The game period showed a trend to increased vital capacity (P = 05). CONCLUSIONS: Spirometer games elicit forced expiratory breath maneuvers in pediatric CF patients.

Based on self-determination theory and the concept of personal interest, we propose that: Satisfying students' basic needs for competence, autonomy, and relatedness when playing educational games is critical for arousal of intrinsic motivation in learning-through-gaming; Students' interest in the core subject and their intrinsic motivation in learning-through-gaming are important for their perceptions of how relevant they believe the gaming session is for the discipline they are studying. The results from an empirical study indicate that arousal of intrinsic motivation in the ongoing gaming session is more important than pre-gaming interest in the core subject for participants' post-gaming perception of how relevant such gaming is as a means for developing their discipline competence. The results also indicate that satisfying basic needs for competence, autonomy, and relatedness is critical for arousal of intrinsic gaming motivation. Our findings have implications for the choice of pedagogical means when utilizing educational games as a complementary alternative to traditional learning methods. To that end, we offer directions for future research. © 2012 Copyright Scandinavian Journal of Educational Research.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864646497

We found that participants perceived the teammate character as experiencing more secondary emotions than the opponent character, but that they perceived the teammate and opponent character as experiencing equal levels of primary emotions. Thus, participants anthropomorphized the ingroup character to a greater extent than the outgroup character.

The neurobiology of the disorder is thought to involve a wide cortical and subcortical network that includes but is not limited to the amygdala and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). These two regions have been hypothesized to play different roles in stress and anxiety; the amygdala is thought to regulate responses to brief emotional stimuli while the BNST is thought to be involved in more chronic regulation of sustained anxiety. In this study, we exposed medication-free GAD patients as well as non-anxious controls to a gambling game where one of the conditions involved non-contingent monetary loss. This condition of high uncertainty was intended to elicit a stressful response and sustained anxiety. Functional MRI scans were collected simultaneously to investigate BOLD activity in the amygdala and BNST during performance of this task. Compared to controls, we found that GAD patients demonstrated decreased activity in the amygdala and increased activity in the BNST. Skin conductance measures showed a consistent early versus late effect within block where GAD patients demonstrated higher arousal than controls late in the task blocks. Based on these results, we hypothesize that GAD patients disengage the amygdala and its response to acute stress earlier than non-anxious controls making way for the BNST to maintain a more sustained response. Future studies are needed to investigate the temporal dynamics of activation and deactivation in these regions. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",22575329,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863433602

It was expected that both conditions were associated with different game situations. A sample of 441 game situations (241 MIHRs and 200 MHRRs), taken from HR records and individual filming of 12 elite soccer players, was assessed along 7 preseason competition matches. The game situations in which each of these 441 HR conditions took place were identified, using a previously established taxonomy of a combination of field formats and category systems in the Match Vision Studio Premium. For the recording of the HR condition, an HRM Polar was attached to the players when in competition, together with a simultaneous filming of their performance during the game. The HRM and video recordings were synchronized beforehand to be able to relate the game situation in the film with HR conditions. The results showed significant differences between both HR conditions for 4 criteria of game situations (Ball in play, Game Center, Role, and Opposition). In all the cases, the MIHR is more associated with active participation of the players in the game, whereas the MHRR is more associated with the end of this participation.

Natriuretic peptides (NP) prevent cardiac malfunction through pressure, natriuresis action. However, whether race affects the relationships of NP action with cardiac function is unknown. Methods: To assess this, 55 (21 whites and 27 males) normotensive adults underwent a 2-hour protocol of 40 minutes rest, video game stressor and recovery. Mitral inflow and myocardial velocities (tissue Doppler) were recorded every 20 minutes. Blood pressure and heart rate were obtained at 10-minute intervals. Blood samples for pro-atrial NP and pro-brain NP (pro-BNP) were collected every 40 minutes. Results: There were differences in the association between (1) the changes from rest to stress for E/A ratio and double product (whites, r = -0.42; blacks, r = 0. 10; P = 0.034 for difference between correlations); (2) stress E m and pro-atrial NP (whites, r = 0.59; blacks, r = -0.25; P = 0.025); (3) rest E m and BNP (whites, r = 0.83; blacks r = -0.17; P = 000); (4) rest E m/A m and pro-BNP (whites, r = 0.70; blacks, r = -0.42;; P = 0.003); (5) rest E/E m and pro-BNP (whites, r = -0.61; blacks, r = 0.31; P = 0.015) and (6) stress E and pro-BNP (whites, r = 0.56; blacks, r = -0.18; P = 0.043). Conclusion: The higher correlations between levels of NP and diastolic function indices both at rest and stress suggest that NP protective action is more pronounced in whites than in blacks. © 2012 Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins.",22314104,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864357980

Although several naturalistic studies have been conducted showing the usefulness of serious video games in the treatment of some abnormal behaviours, there is a lack of serious games specially designed for treating mental disorders.Aim The purpose of our project was to develop and evaluate a serious video game designed to remediate attitudinal, behavioural and emotional processes of patients with impulse-related disorders.Method and results The video game was created and developed within the European research project PlayMancer. It aims to prove potential capacity to change underlying attitudinal, behavioural and emotional processes of patients with impulse-related disorders. New interaction modes were provided by newly developed components, such as emotion recognition from speech, face and physiological reactions, while specific impulsive reactions were elicited. The video game uses biofeedback for helping patients to learn relaxation skills, acquire better self-control strategies and develop new emotional regulation strategies. In this article, we present a description of the video game used, rationale, user requirements, usability and preliminary data, in several mental disorders. © 2012 Informa UK, Ltd.",22548300,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864213727

Methods: 10 male addicts of WoW were selected as addicts' group, and 10 other healthy male non-addicts who were matched by age, were used as non-game addicts' group. All volunteers participated in fMRI paradigms. WoW associated cue pictures and neutral pictures were shown. We examined functional cerebral regions activated by the pictures with 3.0. T Philips MRI. The imaging signals' database was analyzed by SPM5. The correlation between game craving scores and different image results were assessed. Results: When the game addicts watch the pictures, some brain areas show increased signal activity namely: dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, bilateral temporal cortex, cerebellum, right inferior parietal lobule, right cuneus, right hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, left caudate nucleus. But in these same brain regions we did not observe remarkable activities in the control group. Differential image signal densities of the addict group were subtracted from the health control group, results of which were expressed in the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, inferior parietal lobe and inferior temporal gyrus, cerebellum, right insular and the right angular gyrus.

This study investigated whether a 50 h (10-week) remediation intervention which included both cognitive and social cognitive training would influence neural function in regions that support social cognition. Twenty-two stable, outpatient schizophrenia participants were randomized to a treatment condition consisting of auditory-based cognitive training (AT) [Brain Fitness Program/auditory module ~. 60 min/day] plus social cognition training (SCT) which was focused on emotion recognition [~. 5-15 min per day] or a placebo condition of non-specific computer games (CG) for an equal amount of time. Pre and post intervention assessments included an fMRI task of positive and negative facial emotion recognition, and standard behavioral assessments of cognition, emotion processing, and functional outcome. There were no significant intervention-related improvements in general cognition or functional outcome. fMRI results showed the predicted group-by-time interaction. Specifically, in comparison to CG, AT. +. SCT participants had a greater pre-to-post intervention increase in postcentral gyrus activity during emotion recognition of both positive and negative emotions. Furthermore, among all participants, the increase in postcentral gyrus activity predicted behavioral improvement on a standardized test of emotion processing (MSCEIT: Perceiving Emotions).

The aims of this study were to examine and compare the physiological demands and activity profiles of players at dif-ferent competitive levels during futsal match play. Methods. Fifteen professional futsal players (elite group) and 15 university futsal players (amateur group) participated in the study. The players in each group were divided into th-ree teams; each team consisted of 1 goalkeeper and 4 outfield players. All players were observed during two match simu-lated competitive games. The physiological demands were analyzed by measuring heart rate, estimated V•O2 from an individual HR-V•O2 relationship, and earlobe-blood lactate concentration before and at the end of the match. Activity profiles were analyzed for whole game movement patterns using a computer-based tracking system. Results. The physiological demands of the outfield players in the elite group was higher (P&lt;0.05) than in the amateur group (%HRmax: 89.8±5.8 vs. 86.2±6.7%, %V•O2max: 77.9±9 vs. 73.1±6.2% and blood lactate: 5.5±1.4 vs. 5.1±1.5 mmol/L, respectively).

Players completed three different conditioned small-sided 4 vs. 4 games (1 ball touch. =1T, 2 ball touches. =2T and Free Play. =FP) as well as two friendly matches. Heart rate (HR), blood lactate ([La]), ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) as well as physical and technical performance were analyzed. Compared to match-play, total distance covered per minute of play, high-intensity running activities (sprinting and high-intensity runs), total numbers of duels and lost ball possessions were significantly greater within SSGs for all playing positions (p<. .05). In contrast, [La], percentage of successful passes and number of ball possessions were lower (p<. .05) within SSGs, particularly with 1T and 2T rules, in comparison with match-play. HR was higher in SSGs compared to match-play for all playing positions, and RPE values were lower (p<. .05) during the FP SSG for defensive midfielders, wide midfielders and forwards. In conclusion, this study revealed that 4 vs. 4 SSGs played with 1 or 2 ball touches increased the high-intensity running and the difficulty to perform technical actions, being more specific to match demands. Subsequently, it is of importance for coaches to understand the different physiological demands imposed upon players by varying the rules of SSGs and to understand the differences between positional roles. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",22341858,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84870244620

To date, most clinical studies have used selfreport questionnaires or physiological measures to appraise the degree of presence. Some studies that have tested behavioral scales have used a single VE, required additional equipment, or did not test psychometric properties during immersion in the VR. The current study described and tested an operationalized, easy-to-use scale of presence, the Behavior Presence Test in Threatening VEs (BPTT), through the observation of overt behavior exhibited by a sample of 40 participants during immersion in five different threatening virtual situations. The BPTT was compared with standard subjective and physiological measures of presence and anxiety. The VEs resulted in clear increases in anxiety and arousal. Most importantly, findings demonstrated the consistency, reliability and validity of the BPTT. Video game experience did not seem to have any impact on presence or on participants' behavior.

Effectively responding to a critical event is a requirement for all nurses illustrating the need for effective educational approaches from pre-registration training through to enhancing and maintaining life support skills after qualification. This paper reports the findings of utilising a web-based multimedia simulation game PULSE (Platform for Undergraduate Life Support Education). The platform was developed to enhance the student experience of life support education, to motivate on-going learning and engagement and to improve psychomotor skills associated with the provision of Intermediate Life Support (ILS) training. Pre training participants played PULSE and during life support training data was collected from an intervention and a control group of final year undergraduate nursing students (N = 34). Quantitative analysis of performance took place and qualitative data was generated from a questionnaire assessing the learning experience. A statistically significant difference was found between the competence the groups displayed in the three skills sets of checking equipment, airway assessment and the safe/effective use of defibrillator at ILS level, and PULSE was positively evaluated as an educational tool when used alongside traditional life support training. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",22082881,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863858489

In this study, 13 OCD patients and 13 healthy matched controls underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while playing an interactive risky choice game encompassing distinct intervals of threat and reward; as well as anatomical diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Compared to healthy controls OCD patients were reluctant to make risky choices during the game. Furthermore, they displayed higher amygdala activation to threat; lower nucleus accumbens (Nacc) activation to reward and reduced functional connectivity of the amygdala and Nacc to two frontal regions, the orbito-frontal cortex (OFC) and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), respectively. OCD patients also displayed reduced structural integrity in clusters within the uncinate and cingulum fiber tracts. Finally, these deficits in limbic-frontal connectivity pathways, both at the functional and structural level, were associated with severity of OCD symptoms, as well as with each other. Our results thus suggest that risk aversion in OCD is mediated by abnormal limbic responses to threatening and rewarding stimuli, as well as by deficient functional and structural limbic-frontal connectivity. Such deficiency characterization may aid in identifying neural predictors for treatment response and localizing individual targets for direct neural intervention treatments. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",22959813,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867140169

Male participants (n = 12) playing at a senior or academy level in rugby union were recruited and each completed three interventions (15. min each) before a competitive game; 1) watching a video clip of successful skill execution by the player with positive coach feedback [VPCF1]; 2) watching a video clip of successful skill execution by an opposing player with cautionary coach feedback [VCCF], 3) the player left alone to self-motivate [SM1]. The first and last interventions were retested [VPCF2 and SM2]. Salivary free T and C measures were taken pre-intervention and pre-game. Within each game, players were rated by coaching staff on a key performance indicator (KPI) from identified skills and an overall performance indicator (OPI), where 1 = best performance to 5 = worst performance. The VPCF1 and VPCF2 interventions both promoted significant T responses (11.8% to 12.5%) before each game and more so than SM1, SM2 and VCCF. The VCCF approach produced the largest C response (17.6%) and this differed from all other treatments. The VPCF interventions were also associated with better game KPI (1.5 to 1.8) and OPI ratings (1.7 to 1.8) than SM1, SM2 and/or VCCF. Across all treatments, greater individual T responses and lower C responses were associated with better KPI and OPI outcomes.

The physiological activity (facial EMG, electrodermal activity, cardiac activity and respiration) of 21 dyads were acquired synchronously while they were playing a digital game either cooperatively or competitively and either at home or in the laboratory. Physiological compliance was defined as the correlation between the physiological signals of the dyad members. The results of this study confirm that physiological compliance is higher in a conflicting situation than when playing cooperatively. Importantly, the results also demonstrate that physiological compliance is related to self-reported social presence. This suggests that physiological compliance is not limited to negative situations but rather increases due to rich interactions. Only minor differences in physiological compliance were observed between home play and laboratory play, suggesting the ecological validity of laboratory measures.

The results show that the presence of mutual eye-gaze enriches the feelings of social presence, fun and game experience; conversely, the absence of mutual eye-gaze dramatically effects the quality of interaction in the video-mediated environment.

Visits lasted for 3 hours (1-hour rest, video game challenge and recovery for experimental visit. Mitral inflow early (E) to late (A) filling velocities (E/A) ratio; mitral valve annular early velocity (E′) and E/E′ ratio were recorded every 30 minutes to evaluate DF. Results: BP and HR increased during experimental visit (all p values < .01).

However, people can also experience spontaneous positive mental images, and these are little understood. Positive images may play a role in promoting healthy positive mood and may be lacking in conditions such as depression. However, they may also occur in problematic states of elevated mood, such as in bipolar disorder. Can we apply an understanding of spontaneous imagery gained by the study of spontaneous negative images to spontaneous positive images? In an analogue of the trauma film studies, 69 volunteers viewed an explicitly positive (rather than traumatic) film. Participants were randomly allocated post-film either to perform a visuospatial task (the computer game 'Tetris') or to a no-task control condition. Viewing the film enhanced positive mood and immediately post-film increased goal setting on a questionnaire measure. The film was successful in generating involuntary memories of specific scenes over the following week. As predicted, compared with the control condition, participants in the visuospatial task condition reported significantly fewer involuntary memories from the film in a diary over the subsequent week. Furthermore, scores on a recognition memory test at 1week indicated an impairment in voluntary recall of the film in the visuospatial task condition. Clinical implications regarding the modulation of positive imagery after a positive emotional experience are discussed.

In this paper, we propose an integrated analysis and control framework for a pan, tilt, zoom (PTZ) camera network in order to maximize various scene understanding performance criteria (e.g., tracking accuracy, best shot, and image resolution) through dynamic camera-to-target assignment and efficient feature acquisition. Moreover, we consider the situation where processing is distributed across the network since it is often unrealistic to have all the image data at a central location. In such situations, the cameras, although autonomous, must collaborate among themselves because each camera's PTZ parameter entails constraints on the others. Motivated by recent work in cooperative control of sensor networks, we propose a distributed optimization strategy, which can be modeled as a game involving the cameras and targets. The cameras gain by reducing the error covariance of the tracked targets or through higher resolution feature acquisition, which, however, comes at the risk of losing the dynamic target. Through the optimization of this reward-versus-risk tradeoff, we are able to control the PTZ parameters of the cameras and assign them to targets dynamically. The tracks, upon which the control algorithm is dependent, are obtained through a consensus estimation algorithm whereby cameras can arrive at a consensus on the state of each target through a negotiation strategy. We analyze the performance of this collaborative sensing strategy in active camera networks in a simulation environment, as well as a real-life camera network. © 2012 IEEE.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862514530

Generally, overlay networks are heterogeneous, dynamic, and distributed environments managed by multiple administrative authorities, shared by users with different and competing interests, or even autonomously provided by independent and rational users. Thus, the structure of a whole overlay network and the peers' rational strategies are ever coevolving. However, there are very few approaches that theoretically investigate the coevolution between network structure and individual rational behaviors. The main motivation of our article lies in that: Unlike existing work which empirically illustrates the interaction between rational strategies and network structure (through simulations), based on EGT (Evolutionary Game Theory), we not only infer a condition that could favor the cooperative strategy over defect strategy, but also theoretically characterizes the structural properties of the formed network. Specifically, our contributions are twofold. First, we strictly derive the critical benefit-to-cost ratio (b/c) that would facilitate the evolution of cooperation. The critical ratio depends on the network structure (the number of peers in system and the average degree of each peer), and the evolutionary rule (the strategy and linking mutation probabilities). Then, according to the evolutionary rules, we formally derive the structural properties of the formed network in full cooperative state. Especially, the degree distribution is compatible with the power-law, and the exponent is (4-3v)/(1-3v), where v is peer's linking mutation probability. Furthermore, we show that, without being harmful to cooperation evolution, a slight change of the evolutionary rule will evolve the network into a small-world structure (high global efficiency and average clustering coefficient), with the same power-law degree distribution as in the original evolution model. © 2012 ACM.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864831669

Participants subjectively rated the experience of sharing a reward more positively with their friends than the other partners. Neuroimaging results support participants' subjective reports, as ventral striatal BOLD responses were more robust when sharing monetary gains with a friend as compared to the confederate or computer, suggesting a higher value for sharing with an in-network partner. Interestingly, ratings of social closeness covaried with this activity, resulting in a significant partner × closeness interaction; exploratory analysis showed that only participants reporting higher levels of closeness demonstrated partner-related differences in striatal BOLD response.

The interventions showed either video footage of player mistakes with negative coach feedback (NCF1) or player successes with positive feedback (PCF1). Both approaches were repeated (NCF2 and PCF2). In the following week, participants were assessed for their free testosterone (T) and cortisol (C) responses to a physical stress-test, pre-game T and game-ranked performance.

Subjective health complaints have also become a problem among children. In the present study, we investigated the relationship between media use and health status in elementary school children in Japan. Methods: A cross-sectional school-based population survey was conducted in 2009 with a sample of fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-grade children (age range: 1012 years old) in elementary schools in Japan (n = 3,464). Self-reported health, lifestyle habits, and time spent using media were assessed. Results: The use of games, television, and personal computers was significantly associated with lifestyle (p<0.05) and subjective health (p<0.05). In addition, the use of games, the use of television, and the use of personal computers were mutually associated. The greater the number of media used for more than 1 hour was, the higher the odds ratio of the association of media use with unhealthy lifestyle and subjective health complaints was. The plural use of these media had stronger associations with unhealthy lifestyle and subjective health complaints. Conclusions: Game, television, and personal-computer use were mutually associated, and the plural use of these media had stronger associations with unhealthy lifestyle and subjective health complaints.

Eligible year-7 students (2353/3144, mean age 12.7 years) from a random cluster sample of 21 Sydney schools were examined during 2003-2005. Parents and children completed detailed questionnaires of activity. BP was measured using a standard protocol and high BP was defined using published guidelines. Height and weight were measured, and body mass index (BMI) calculated. After adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, parental education, height, BMI and time spent in physical activity, each hour per day spent in screen time, watching TV and playing video games was associated with a significant increase in diastolic BP of 0.44 (P0.0001), 0.99 (P0.0001) and 0.64 mm Hg (P0.04), respectively. In contrast, each hour per day spent reading was associated with a decrease of 0.91 (P0.01) and 0.69 mm Hg (P0.02) in systolic and diastolic BP, respectively.

Despite the absence of response monitoring demands and thus overt response conflicts, the experiment revealed a differential physiological response pattern as a function of item type. First, probes elicited the largest skin conductance responses. Second, differential hemodynamic responses were observed in bilateral inferior frontal regions, the right supramarginal gyrus and the supplementary motor area as a function of item type. Probes and targets were accompanied by a larger signal increase than irrelevant items in these regions. Moreover, the responses to probes differed substantially from targets.

However, most of this research has focused on young adults and it remains unclear whether our current models extend to healthy aging. To address this question, we investigated the behavioral and neural basis of simple economic decisions in 18 young and 20 older healthy adults. Participants made decisions which involved accepting or rejecting monetary offers from human and non-human (computer) partners in an Ultimatum Game, while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The partners' proposals involved splitting an amount of money between the two players, and ranged from $1 to $5 (from a $10 pot). Relative to young adults, older participants expected more equitable offers and rejected moderately unfair offers ($3) to a larger extent. Imaging results revealed that, relative to young participants, older adults had higher activations in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) when receiving unfair offers ($1-$3). Age group moderated the relationship between left DLPFC activation and acceptance rates of unfair offers. In contrast, older adults showed lower activation of bilateral anterior insula in response to unfair offers. No age group difference was observed when participants received fair ($5) offers. These findings suggest that healthy aging may be associated with a stronger reliance on computational areas subserving goal maintenance and rule shifting (DLPFC) during interactive economic decision-making. Consistent with a well-documented "" positivity effect"" , older age may also decrease recruitment of areas involved in emotion processing and integration (anterior insula) in the face of social norm violation. © 2012.",22414593,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861226064

Stroke is a leading cause of disability in healthy adults. The purpose of this pilot study was to assess the feasibility and outcomes of a novel video gaming repetitive practice paradigm, (ENGAGE) enhanced neurorehabilitation: guided activity-based gaming exercise. Methods. Sixteen individuals at least three months after stroke served as participants. All participants received concurrent outpatient therapy or took part in a stroke exercise class and completed at least 500 minutes of gaming. Primary baseline and posttest outcome measures included the Wolf motor function test (WMFT) and the Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA). ENGAGE uses a game selection algorithm providing focused, graded activity-based repetitive practice that is highly individualized and directed. The Wilcoxon signed ranks test was used to determine statistical significance. Results. There were improvements in the WMFT (P=0.003) and the FMA (P=0.002) that exceeded established values of minimal clinically important difference. Conclusions.

Here, we investigated how incidental affect (i.e. emotional states unrelated to the decision at hand) may influence decisions, and how these biases are implemented in the brain. Nineteen adult participants made decisions which involved accepting or rejecting monetary offers from others in an Ultimatum Game while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Prior to each set of decisions, participants watched a short video clip aimed at inducing either a sad or neutral emotional state. Results demonstrated that, as expected, sad participants rejected more unfair offers than those in the neutral condition. Neuroimaging analyses revealed that receiving unfair offers while in a sad mood elicited activity in brain areas related to aversive emotional states and somatosensory integration (anterior insula) and to cognitive conflict (anterior cingulate cortex). Sad participants also showed a diminished sensitivity in neural regions associated with reward processing (ventral striatum). Importantly, insular activation uniquely mediated the relationship between sadness and decision bias. This study is the first to reveal how subtle mood states can be integrated at the neural level to influence decision-making. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",22374480,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858976005

However, few studies specifically manipulated game features for each of the three basic needs specified in the self-determination theory (SDT) to examine how the game features impact players' need satisfaction and game experience. The current study employed an in-house developed exergame and manipulated the game features in a 2 (autonomy-supportive game features: on vs. off) × 2 (competence-supportive game features: on vs. off) experiment to predict need satisfaction, game enjoyment, motivation for future play, effort for gameplay, self-efficacy for exercise using the game, likelihood of game recommendation, and game rating. The manipulated game features led to the corresponding need satisfaction. Manipulated autonomy-supportive and competence-supportive game features had main effects on most motivation and engagement outcomes. Need satisfaction of autonomy and need satisfaction of competence were both found to be mediators for the relationships between the game features and the motivation and engagement outcomes. The findings add evidence to support the underlying mechanism postulated by SDT for media enjoyment and motivation as well as the emerging entertainment research conceptualizing enjoyment as need satisfaction.

Self-benefiting behavior despite loss to others is especially common among youth with CP and callous-unemotional traits (CU). Such behavioral tendencies are generally measured using self- or observer-report. We are unaware of attempts to measure this tendency with a behavioral paradigm. Methods/Principal Findings: In our AlAn's (altruism-antisocial) game a computer program presents subjects with a series of offers in which they will receive money but a planned actual charity donation will be reduced; subjects decide to accept or reject each offer. We tested (1) whether adolescent patients with CP (n = 20) compared with adolescent controls (n = 19) differed on AlAn's game outcomes, (2) whether youths with CP and CU differed significantly from controls without CP or CU, and (3) whether AlAn's game outcomes correlated significantly with CP and separately, CU severity. Patients with CP and CU compared with controls without these problems took significantly more money for themselves and left significantly less money in the charity donation; AlAn's game outcomes were significantly correlated with CU, but not CP. Conclusions/Significance: In the AlAn's game adolescents with conduct problems and CU traits, compared with controls without CP/CU, are disposed to benefit themselves while costing others even in a novel situation, devoid of peer influences, where anonymity is assured, reciprocity or retribution are impossible, intoxication is absent and when the ""other"" to be harmed is considered beneficent. AlAn's game outcomes are associated with measures of CU. Results suggest that the AlAn's game provides an objective means of capturing information about CU traits.

Although game play has been intensively studied, the underlying neurobiology is still poorly understood. Flow theory is a well-established model developed to describe subjective game experience. In 13 healthy male subjects, we acquired fMRI data during free play of a video game and analyzed brain activity based on the game content. In accordance with flow theory, we extracted the following factors from the game content: (i) balance between ability and challenge; (ii) concentration and focus; (iii) direct feedback of action results; (iv) clear goals; and (v) control over the situation/activity. We suggest that flow is characterized by specific neural activation patterns and that the latter can be assessed-at least partially-by content factors contributing to the emergence of flow. Each of the content factors was characterized by specific and distinguishable brain activation patterns, encompassing reward-related midbrain structures, as well as cognitive and sensorimotor networks. The activation of sensory and motor networks in the conjunction analyses underpinned the central role of simulation for flow experience.

Results: Of 410 patients receiving PT in the medical ICU, 22 (5% of all patients; male, 64%; median age, 52 years) had 42 PT treatments with video games (median [interquartile range] per patient, 1.0 [1.0-2.0]). Main indications for video game therapy included balance (52%) and endurance (45%), and the most common activities included boxing (38%), bowling (24%), and balance board (21%). Of 42 treatments, 69% occurred while standing and 45% while mechanically ventilated. During 35 hours of PT treatment, 0 safety events occurred (95% upper confidence limit for safety event rate, 8.4%). Conclusions: Novel use of interactive video games as part of routine PT in critically ill patients is feasible and appears safe in our case series. Video game therapy may complement existing rehabilitation techniques for ICU patients. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",21944880,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858621320

The current study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to determine whether induced stress resulted in gender-specific patterns of brain activation during a decision task involving monetary reward. Specifically, we manipulated physiological stress levels using a cold pressor task, prior to a risky decision making task. Healthy men (n = 24, 12 stressed) and women (n = 23, 11 stressed) completed the decision task after either cold pressor stress or a control task during the period of cortisol response to the cold pressor. Gender differences in behavior were present in stressed participants but not controls, such that stress led to greater reward collection and faster decision speed in males but less reward collection and slower decision speed in females. A gender-by-stress interaction was observed for the dorsal striatum and anterior insula. With cold stress, activation in these regions was increased in males but decreased in females. The findings of this study indicate that the impact of stress on reward-related decision processing differs depending on gender. © The Author (2011).

While objectively equivalent to an outright miss, near-misses motivate ongoing play and may therefore be implicated in the development of disordered gambling. Given naturalistic data showing increases in heart rate (HR) and electrodermal activity (EDA) during periods of real gambling play, we sought to explore the phasic impact of win, near-miss and full-miss outcomes on physiological arousal in a controlled laboratory environment. EDA and HR were monitored as healthy, student participants (n = 33) played a simulated slot-machine task involving unpredictable monetary wins. A second gambling distortion, perceived personal control, was manipulated within the same task by allowing the participant to select the play icon on some trials, and having the computer automatically select the play icon on other trials. Near-misses were rated as less pleasant than full-misses. However, on trials that involved personal choice, near-misses produced higher ratings of 'continue to play' than full-misses. Winning outcomes were associated with phasic EDA responses that did not vary with personal choice. Compared to full-misses, near-miss outcomes also elicited an EDA increase, which was greater on personal choice trials. Near-misses were also associated with greater HR acceleration than other outcomes. Near-miss outcomes are capable of eliciting phasic changes in physiological arousal consistent with a state of subjective excitement, despite their objective non-win status. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",21516368,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862844599

Nonetheless, an increasing number of studies suggest that acute administration of nicotine may alter other reinforcing behaviors in both animal and human models, raising the possibility that nicotine may also influence gambling behavior and craving. Objectives The purpose of this study was to examine the acute effects of nicotine on subjective and behavioral gambling responses. Methods Twenty-eight (15 male) regular gamblers who smoke daily completed two double-blind laboratory sessions where their subjective and behavioral responses to video lottery terminal (VLT) gambling were assessed, following the administration of nicotine inhalers (NI; 4 mg deliverable) or placebo inhalers. Results NI significantly decreased tobacco-related cravings (p<0.05) but did not affect gambling-related cravings, VLT betting patterns, or subjective responses (ps>0.1). Conclusions NI were found to acutely suppress tobacco-related cravings without influencing gambling. These results suggest that use of nicotine replacement therapies may be a safe option for gamblers who are attempting to quit smoking. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",21904819,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858445724

A further aim of the study was to evaluate the relationships between FBL s, maximal oxygen consumption (VO 2max) and distance covered during a game. A multistage field test was administered to 32 players to determine FBL s and VO 2max. Blood lactate (LA), heart rate (HR) and rate of perceived exertion (RPE) responses were obtained from 36 players during tournament matches filmed using six fixed cameras. Images were transferred to a computer, for calibration and synchronization. In all players, values for LA and HR were higher and RPE lower during the 1 st half compared to the 2 nd half of the matches (p &lt; 0.01). Players in forward positions had higher LA levels than defenders, but HR and RPE values were similar between playing positions. Total distance and distance covered in jogging, low-moderatehigh intensity running and low intensity sprint were higher during the 1 st half (p &lt; 0.01). In the 1 st half, players also ran longer distances at FBL s [p&lt;0.01; average running speed at 2mmol·L -1 (FBL 2): 3.32 ± 0.31m·s -1 and average running speed at 4mmol·L -1 (FBL 4): 3.91 ± 0.25m·s -1]. There was a significant difference between playing positions in distance covered at different running speeds (p &lt; 0.05). However, when distance covered was expressed as FBL s, the players ran similar distances. In addition, relationships between FBL s and total distance covered were significant (r = 0.482 to 0.570; p &lt; 0.01). In conclusion, these findings demonstrated that young soccer players experienced higher internal load during the 1 st half of a game compared to the 2 nd half.

While this image appears to promote a revolutionary vision of choice opposing gender stratifications, it responds to the sexual anxieties of a shifting postcolonial context by reconciling women's choices with patriarchal and communalist values. To justify its ostensible ""feminist"" revolution, the imagery draws upon indigenous oppositional traditions of gender portrayal while flexibly utilizing opposition in the services of an inequitable market. Even as the neoliberal canon of (free) women and (unfree) labor is narrowcast on regional-language satellite channels throughout Bengal and its diasporas, this canon is being debated through critical embodiments of women, work, and choice in oppositional-feminist cinema. I look, on the one hand, at televisual adaptations of woman-centered works by a foremost gender-activist of the anti-colonial era, Rabindranath Tagore. The adaptive canon is read in tandem with a widely popular game show on Bengali satellite television called The Earning Homemaker. On the other hand, I consider how oppositional-feminist filmmaker Aparna Sen is undoing the prevalent canon of woman's autonomy in her recent films. My point overall is to explore how we could disentangle the oppositional from dominant neo-humanist communication patterns. I argue that we must situate various depictions of women's ""choice"" within specific relations of power, distribution, and technologies of persuasion-considering what differs and why the differences tend to be elided. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857279478

Globally, an estimated 10% of school-aged children, between 5 and 17 years of age, are overweight and obese. Obesity can be seen as first wave of a defined cluster of non-communicable diseases called ""New World Syndrome"" creating an enormous socio-economic and public health burden in poorer countries. The most important consequence of childhood obesity is its persistence into adulthood with all its health risks like dyslipidemia, hyper-insulinemia, cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, osteoarthritis, gall bladder disease, hypertension and some sex hormone- sensitive cancers.

The proposed path finding algorithm first computes an optimal path from an initial point to a target point after analyzing the 3-D terrain data from which it constructs a weighted graph. Then, it employs a real-time path finding algorithm specifically designed to realize the navigation of the group from one waypoint to the successive one on the optimal path generated at the previous stage, preserving the formation and avoiding collision.

Current generation smartphones' video camera technologies enable photoplethysmographic (PPG) acquisition and heart rate (HR) measurement. The study objective was to develop an Android application and compare HRs derived from a Motorola Droid to electrocardiograph (ECG) and Nonin 9560BT pulse oximeter readings during various movement-free tasks. Materials and Methods. HRs were collected simultaneously from 14 subjects, ages 20 to 58, healthy or with clinical conditions, using the 3 devices during 5-minute periods while at rest, reading aloud under observation, and playing a video game. Correlation between the 3 devices was determined, and Bland-Altman plots for all possible pairs of devices across all conditions assessed agreement. Results. Across conditions, all device pairs showed high correlations. Bland-Altman plots further revealed the Droid as a valid measure for HR acquisition. Across all conditions, the Droid compared to ECG, 95 of the data points (differences between devices) fell within the limits of agreement. Conclusion. The Android application provides valid HRs at varying levels of movement free mental/perceptual motor exertion. Lack of electrode patches or wireless sensor telemetric straps make it advantageous for use in mobile-cell-phone-delivered health promotion and wellness programs. Further validation is needed to determine its applicability while engaging in physical movement-related activities. Copyright © 2012 Mathew J.

The objective of this study was to compare the achievement of learning outcomes of undergraduate nursing students when a virtual patient trainer or a traditional lecture was used to teach pediatric respiratory content. Methods: This was a randomized, controlled, posttest design. A virtual pediatric hospital unit was populated with four virtual pediatric patients having different respiratory diseases that were designed to meet the same learning objectives as a traditional lecture. The study began in Spring 2010 with 93 Senior I, baccalaureate nursing students. Students were randomized to receive either a traditional lecture or an experience with a virtual patient trainer. Students' knowledge acquisition was evaluated using multiple-choice questions, and knowledge application was measured as timeliness of care in two simulated clinical scenarios using high-fidelity mannequins and standardized patients. Results: Ninety-three students participated in the study, of which 46 were in the experimental group that received content using the virtual patient trainer. After the intervention, students in the experimental group had significantly higher knowledge acquisition (P = 0.004) and better knowledge application (P = 0.001) for each of the two scenarios than students in the control group. Conclusions: The purpose of this project was to compare a virtual patient trainer to a traditional lecture for the achievement of learning outcomes for pediatric respiratory content. Although the virtual patient trainer experience produced statistically better outcomes, the differences may not be clinically significant. The results suggest that a virtual patient trainer may be an effective substitute for the achievement of learning outcomes that are typically met using a traditional lecture format. Further research is needed to understand how best to integrate a virtual patient trainer into undergraduate nursing education.

Methods: In October 2008, a self-report survey was distributed to 2075 children in kindergartens (n = 261), elementary schools (n = 1162), and junior high schools (n = 652) in Shimane, Japan. The questionnaire gathered data on sex, school year, feeling upon awakening, and time spent using IT devices after school (television, videos on television, video games, personal computers, and cellular phones). After adjusting for sex and school year, data were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression analysis to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: A total of 2030 children completed this survey (response rate, 97.8%). Negative FA was associated with watching television more than 2 hours/day (OR = 1.51, 95% CI = 1.23-1.85), playing video games more than 30 minutes/day (1.50, 1.20-1.87), and using personal computers more than 30 minutes/day (1.35, 1.04-1.75).

Financial gambles can be used to study effective decisionmaking experimentally, and to distinguish processes involved in choice option evaluation from outcome feedback and other contextual factors. Here, we used a paradigm where participants evaluated 'mixed' gambles, each presenting a potential gain and a potential loss and an associated variable outcome probability. We recorded neural responses using autonomic monitoring, electroencephalography (EEG) and functional neuroimaging (fMRI), and used a univariate, parametric design to test for correlations with the eleven economic parameters that varied across gambles, including expected value (EV) and amount magnitude. Consistent with behavioural economic theory, participants were risk-averse. Gamble evaluation generated detectable autonomic responses, but only weak correlations with outcome uncertainty were found, suggesting that peripheral autonomic feedback does not play a major role in this task. Long-latency stimulus-evoked EEG potentials were sensitive to expected gain and expected value, while alpha-band power reflected expected loss and amount magnitude, suggesting parallel representations of distinct economic qualities in cortical activation and central arousal. Neural correlates of expected value representation were localized using fMRI to ventromedial prefrontal cortex, while the processing of other economic parameters was associated with distinct patterns across lateral prefrontal, cingulate, insula and occipital cortices including default-mode network and early visual areas. These multimodal data provide complementary evidence for distributed substrates of choice evaluation across multiple, predominantly cortical, brain systems wherein distinct regions are preferentially attuned to specific economic features. Our findings extend biologically-plausible models of risky decision-making while providing potential biomarkers of economic representations that can be applied to the study of deficits in motivational behaviour in neurological and psychiatric patients. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",22101380,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859426507

Thus, emotions are immersed in different areas of a person's life, including social, functional, and cognitive aspects. It has an important role in the decision-making process.

In this paper we present the application of evolutionary strategies to the self-emergence of a common lexicon in a population of agents. By modeling the vocabulary or lexicon of each agent as an association matrix or look-up table that maps the meanings (i.e. the objects encountered by the agents or the states of the environment itself) into symbols or signals we check whether it is possible for the population to converge in an autonomous, decentralized way to a common lexicon, so that the communication efficiency of the entire population is optimal. We have conducted several experiments aimed at testing whether it is possible to converge with evolutionary strategies to an optimal Saussurean communication system. We have organized our experiments alongside two main lines: first, we have investigated the effect of the population size on the convergence results. Second, and foremost, we have also investigated the effect of the lexicon size on the convergence results. To analyze the convergence of the population of agents we have defined the population's consensus when all the agents (i.e. 100% of the population) share the same association matrix or lexicon.

Although ozone concentration decreased during Olympics, high ozone episodes occurred on 24 July and 24 August with concentration of 360 and 245 μg/m 3 at Aoyuncun site, respectively. The analysis of sensitive test, with and without emission controls, shows that emission controls could reduce ozone concentration in the afternoon when ozone concentration was highest but increase it at night and in the morning. The evolution of the weather system during the ozone episodes (24 July and 24 August) indicates that hot and dry air and a stable weak pressure field intensified the production of ozone and allowed it to accumulate. Process analysis at the urban site and rural site shows that under favorable weather condition on 24 August, horizontal transport was the main contributor of the rural place and the pollution from the higher layer would be transported to the surface layer. On 24 July, as the wind velocity was smaller, the impact of transport on the rural place was not obvious. © 2012 The Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.",22783614,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862972267

A total of 66 elite and nonelite male Estonian volleyball players aged 16-17 years were measured for anthropometric and physical variables and sport-specific skills. In addition, the players' provided self-reports of dispositional achievement goals, perceived sport competence and enjoyment and their game intelligence was measured. Selected youth players scored better than nonselected youth players on physical (explosive strength), technical (passing and spiking), and cognitive (game intelligence) characteristics and reported higher mastery-approach goals, perceived sport competence and enjoyment of sport. The most discriminating variables were game intelligence, mastery approach goals, perceived sport competence and passing technique. These results suggest the important role of multidimensional performance measures in selecting and developing young male volleyball players. Structured talent identification and development programs have been developed for several sports, in particular athletics, rowing, gymnastics, field hockey and soccer, where success has been related to anthropometric, physiological and motor skill attributes (3,25,34,46). According to Williams and Reilly (50), research should adopt a multidisciplinary approach to talent identification. Recently, Vaeyens et al. (46) suggested that when researchers will concentrate on a combination of anthropometric, physical, and physiological measures, their predictive value has proven problematic in the majority of team sports. For example, Gabbett and coworkers demonstrated that subjective coach evaluation of passing and serving technique, but not physiological and anthropometric data, discriminate between successful and unsuccessful talent-identified junior volleyball players (20). In addition, an increasing number of researchers have argued that potentially important psychological variables are often overlooked within talent identifcation models (1,34,46). Research suggests that successful elite athletes posses a range of psychological characteristics including the ability to cope with anxiety and obstacles, selfconfdence, competitiveness, intrinsic motivation, and the ability to set and achieve goals (22,40). Termed ""Psychological Characteristics of Developing Excellence"", or PCDEs, these factors allowed aspiring elites to optimize development opportunities, adapt to setbacks and effectively negotiate key transitions encountered along the pathway to excellence (29). However, relatively little scientific evidence has been accumulated thus far as to which skills are required at different stages, for different activities, or even idiosyncratically for different individuals. Motivation is a construct that underpins much of the literature on personal characteristics of talent identification and numerous authors have attested to its important role in the development of sport expertise (1,12,13,34). According to achievement goal theory, it is assumed that people judge their competence and define successful accomplishment via at last two different goal perspectives-task and ego goals (32). People who are strongly task oriented tend to demonstrate their competence in a self-referenced manner and focus on realizing personal improvement, task-mastery and learning. Individuals who have a strong ego orientation have a tendency to want to demonstrate high competence relative to other people (38). Recently, the valence dimension of competence has been integrated into the achievement goal literature to create a 2 × 2 achievement goal framework (15). The 2 × 2 achievement goal framework comprises four distinct achievement goals: mastery-approach, mastery-avoidance, performance-approach, and performance-avoidance. In the limited studies that have been done in sport contexts, mastery-approach goals have been found to be positively linked to the belief that sport competence can be developed ant competence valuation, and negatively related to state anxiety and motivation (7,9). Performance-approach goals have been found to correlate positively with the belief that one' s level of sport competence is fixed, perceptions of performance climate, and competence valuation and negatively link to state anxiety. Performance-avoidance and mastery-avoidance tend to correlate with a network of negative achievementrelated processes and outcomes, including state anxiety and amotivation (7,9). Further, perceived competence is considered to be a primary antecedent of goal adoption. High perceived competence is posited to orient individuals to the possibility of success, and to facilitate the adoption of approach goals. In contrast, low perceived competence is supposed to orient individuals to the possibility of failure to facilitate the adoption of avoidance goals (15). Enjoyment has been recognized as a key factor for motivated behavior and sustained involvement in youth sport (40,41,48). Enjoyment as ""a positive affective response to the sport experience that reflects generalized feelings such as pleasure, liking and fun"" (41, p. 6) is the theoretical defnition used in this study (10). Enjoyment is also a component of achievement goal theory (32) and an important outcome in its own right as young athletes who enjoy participating in their sport have more meaningful sport experience and more likely to continue participation (48). To solve a problem effectively in a sport-challenging context, the performer has to perceive the environment, anticipate the on-going activity, make a decision, and respond as quickly and as accurately as he or she is capable of doing (42). Game intelligence in team sports refects a player's ability to use cognitive processes (ability to read the game, having strong tactical awareness) during games when they have to execute a game plan against the other team (18). Therefore, by applying a multidimensional design of talent identifcation in ball games such as volleyball, the cognitive ability to solve tactical problems should be assessed in addition to motor, motivational and technical variables (18,42). The purpose of this study was to determine whether anthropometric, physical, psychological, and skill test results could be used to discriminate between male junior volleyball players of varying ability. Based on previous research (19,20,28), we expected that volleyball skills and explosive strength but not anthropometric characteristics would discriminate between junior volleyball players of different levels. With regard to psychological variables, we anticipated that youth national team players exhibited higher levels of game intelligence, mastery-and performance approach goals, perceived sport competence and enjoyment when compared with nonselected players. Method: Participants: Sixty-five junior volleyball players (mean age, 16.7 ± 0.7 years) participated in this study. An initial invitation to participate in the current study was sent to coaches of 5 volleyball clubs located in Tallinn and Tartu (Estonia). All five clubs agreed to participate and all male volleyball players aged 16-17 years were invited to participate. Participants were assigned into two groups according to playing level: selected-players on the U16 and U18 national youth team; and nonselected-players on regional teams. Measures: Anthropometric and Physical Characteristics: Anthropometry included the recording of stature, body mass and standing reach stature. Stature was measured using a Martin metal anthropometer (A&D Instruments Ltd, UK) to the nearest 0.1 cm and body mass was measured using calibrated digital scales to the nearest 0.1 kg. Standing reach stature was measured using a metal anthropometer. Players were requested to stand with feet flat on the ground, extend their arm and hand, and mark the standing reach stature. Upper-body muscular strength and endurance was evaluated using the 30-s sit-ups test from the EUROFIT test battery (17). The agility of players was evaluated using the Illinois agility run (39) and explosive power was measured using vertical jump test. Participants performed the jumping test on the mobile contact timing mat system (Newtest OY, Finland). Players were instructed to execute all vertical jumps with their hands on the hips to diminish upper body movement and standardize the movement pattern. The highest value obtained from three attempts was used. Volleyball Skills: Each player performed four volleyball skills (spiking, passing, setting and serving) in an indoor stadium. After a standardized warm-up players performed six attempts of each skill. Two video cameras (Sony, HDR-XR520VE), positioned approximately 5 m from the player, were used to film each skill. For spiking and setting skills, players were filmed from the side and front of the player. Players' accuracy was based on the ability to hit specific targets. The players' technique was subjectively evaluated from video footage by two expert coaches using standardized technical protocols (20). Psychological Testing: Dispositional achievement goals in sport were measured via the 12-item Achievement Goals Questionnaire for Sport (AGQ-S; 6). The AGQ-S was designed to tap athletes' ways to strive for demonstrating high competence or avoid demonstrating incompetence in the athletic domain. Study participants responded on a scale ranging from 1=""not at all like me"" to 7=""completely like me"".",22109779,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-83455257779

Twelve children with type 1 diabetes were subjected to two distinct tests at a few weeks interval: (i) a 60-min VG session followed by a 60-min rest period and (ii) a 60-min reading session followed by a 60-min rest period. Heart rate, blood pressure, glycemia, epinephrine (E), norepinephrine (NE), cortisol (F), and growth hormone (GH) were measured at 30 min intervals from -60 to +120 min. Non-parametric Wilcoxon tests for paired data were performed on Δ-values computed from baseline (0 min). Rise in heart rate (p = 0.05) and NE increase (p = 0.03) were shown to be significantly higher during the VG session when compared to the reading session and a significant difference of Δ-glycemic values was measured between the respective rest periods.

In the near future, meaningful video games will be designed to facilitate personal-psychological transformation. Unlike ""serious games"" that focus on education and ""conditioning"" the mind, meaningful games will cultivate emotional intelligence, somatic awareness, and archetypal integration in order to ""un-condition"" the mind and thereby facilitate psychologically meaningful personal transformations. Meaningful game research will access the dynamics of psychological transformation in order to enhance archetypal awareness, intuition, and insight on the part of players. Within the genre of meaningful video games, Drama-Based Games (DBG) add an unprecedented dimension for psychological engagement and decision-making. Because they extend psychological player immersion to the dimension of ""physical"" interactivity, (DBG) incorporate the full range of psychological functions defined by Carl Jung. Because psychological experiences are correlated with physiological processes, DBG may be used as research instruments for quantifying diverse biometric-psychological interactions that occur during game play. Advances in electronics now enable the real-time and non-intrusive capturing of physiological data such as brain waves (e.g., electroencephalography), heart-rate variability, skin response, and facial expression. This data can provide an objective basis for measuring dimensions of the cognitive unconscious in test subjects as they respond to game experiences.

Electrodermal response traditionally have been labor intensive. Protocols and transcription of subject responses were recorded on separate documents, forcing constant shifts of attention between scripts, electrodermal measuring devices and of observations and subject responses.

In a DCOP, each variable is controlled by one of many autonomous agents, who together have the joint goal of maximizing a global objective function. A wide variety of techniques have been explored to solve such problems, and here we focus on one of the main families, namely iterative approximate best-response algorithms used as local search algorithms for DCOPs. We define these algorithms as those in which, at each iteration, agents communicate only the states of the variables under their control to their neighbours on the constraint graph, and that reason about their next state based on the messages received from their neighbours. These algorithms include the distributed stochastic algorithm and stochastic coordination algorithms, the maximum-gain messaging algorithms, the families of fictitious play and adaptive play algorithms, and algorithms that use regret-based heuristics. This family of algorithms is commonly employed in real-world systems, as they can be used in domains where communication is difficult or costly, where it is appropriate to trade timeliness off against optimality, or where hardware limitations render complete or more computationally intensive algorithms unusable. However, until now, no overarching framework has existed for analyzing this broad family of algorithms, resulting in similar and overlapping work being published independently in several different literatures. The main contribution of this paper, then, is the development of a unified analytical framework for studying such algorithms. This framework is built on our insight that when formulated as non-cooperative games, DCOPs form a subset of the class of potential games. This result allows us to prove convergence properties of iterative approximate best-response algorithms developed in the computer science literature using game-theoretic methods (which also shows that such algorithms can also be applied to the more general problem of finding Nash equilibria in potential games), and, conversely, also allows us to show that many game-theoretic algorithms can be used to solve DCOPs. By so doing, our framework can assist system designers by making the pros and cons of, and the synergies between, the various iterative approximate best-response DCOP algorithm components clear. © Cambridge University Press 2011.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-82255169181

There are, however, situations in which the emotional response to others is discordant with their emotional experience. Using event-related potentials, the present study investigated the neural underpinnings of this phenomenon, termed "" counterempathy."" Participants played a card game under the belief that they were playing jointly with another player who sat in an adjoining room and whose smiles and frowns in response to winning or losing in the game they could observe on a computer screen. Depending upon the experimental setting, the other player's facial expressions conveyed either of two opposing values to the participant. In the empathic setting, his emotional expressions were congruent with the participant's outcome (win or loss), whereas in the counterempathic setting, they indicated incongruent outcomes. Results revealed a reversed pattern of brain responses to facial expressions between congruent and incongruent conditions at ~170 ms (N170) over the temporal cortex. That is, N170 was sensitive to frowns in the congruent condition and to smiles in the incongruent condition, both indicating losses for the participant. Furthermore, frowns in the incongruent condition yielded larger medial frontal negativity (MFN) over the medial prefrontal cortex, which correlated with the subjective pleasantness about one's own winning in the incongruent condition. These findings demonstrate that (1) counterempathic responses are associated with modulation of early sensory processing of emotional cues, (2) that MFN is sensitive to the detection of another person's loss during positive inequity, and (3) that MFN is associated with a pleasant feeling during positive inequity, which is possibly related to "" Schadenfreude"". © 2011 American Psychological Association.",21728414,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-83755219932

Here we address two questions relating to timing with the goal of better understanding the neural mechanisms underlying temporal processing. First, how does accuracy and variance change over the course of learning of complex spatiotemporal patterns? Second, is the timing of sequential responses most consistent with starting and stopping an internal timer at each interval or with continuous timing? To address these questions we used a psychophysical task in which subjects learned to reproduce a sequence of finger taps in the correct order and at the correct times- much like playing a melody at the piano. This task allowed us to calculate the variance of the responses at different time points using data from the same trials. Our results show that while ""standard"" Weber's law is clearly violated, variance does increase as a function of time squared, as expected according to the generalized form of Weber's law- which separates the source of variance into time-dependent and time-independent components. Over the course of learning, both the time-independent variance and the coefficient of the time-dependent term decrease. Our analyses also suggest that timing of sequential events does not rely on the resetting of an internal timer at each event. We describe and interpret our results in the context of computer simulations that capture some of our psychophysical findings. Specifically, we show that continuous timing, as opposed to ""reset"" timing, is consistent with population clock"" models in which timing emerges from the internal dynamics of recurrent neural networks. © 2011 Laje, Cheng and Buonomano.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-82255160744

Zombies are bodies without emotions, acting on primal instincts alone. They speak to everything that we as humans are not supposed to be. Their predisposition toward brains, flesh, blood and gore creates an uncomfortable fascination for horror fans. However, I would argue that the popularity of zombies in North America is also largely attributable to the fact that their very existence counters many dominant norms that circulate within our society, specifically calling us to question ideas surrounding beautiful bodies, life and death, structured spaces, and mass consumption. In a capitalist economy fuelled by the pathological need for continual growth, it becomes clear that the zombie of modern film and television often acts as a stand-in for the true cultural dupes of mass consumption: us (Dendle 2007, 51). They also symbolize apocalyptic events, when humans and all their daily spaces and practices are slowly taken over by the undead: Animated corpses. In popular zombie films, the undead are almost always portrayed in public spaces, walking-or dragging- Themselves from place to place, consuming in the most literal of ways (i.e., eating human flesh). As they move slowly through public spaces, invoking fear in the humans around them, they take on a familiar appearance: us, just going through the motions. The commentary here is clear: we, too, can be zombies, even if our hearts are still beating. The popularity of zombies is found not only in the abundance of zombie films created over the years (Night of the Living Dead, Army of Darkness, 28 Days Later and Shaun of the Dead, to name but a few), but also in the ways that zombies have infiltrated our daily lives. The flesh and gore associated with zombies have managed to creep their way into nearly every facet of popular culture-works of fiction and comic books (The Zombie Survival Guide, Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, The Walking Dead, Blackest Night); video games (Left 4 Dead, Resident Evil, Dead Rising); board games (Zombies!!!, Last Night on Earth); music (""Walk like a Zombie"" by the HorrorPops, Rob Zombie, Zombie Girl); and even zombie pinups and porn (ZombiePinups. com, Porn of the Dead). One of the most interesting examples of zombies in everyday culture is the zombie walk, in which mass groups of the ""living dead"" congregate in large cities all over North America and Western Europe, and march in the streets. This is a relatively recent phenomenon, with the first documented, non-commercial zombie walk taking place in Toronto, Ontario, in 2003 (Dalgetty 2007). These walks are comprised of individuals, primarily teenagers and young adults, dressed and made up as zombies, walking, shuffling and dragging themselves slowly through urban spaces. As the zombies shuffle and drag themselves along, they cause a spectacle: They halt traffic, stop pedestrians from shopping ""normally,"" disturb onlookers and raise questions. Because our urban spaces are highly ordered and regulated places, the purposeful disruption of the zombie walk-the performance of the living dead in public areas-affords the opportunity to reclaim urban spaces and disrupt dominant ideologies, even if only momentarily. Very few monsters have managed to embed themselves within the popular imagination as successfully as zombies. Although most monsters originate in folklore, then move to literature and finally enter mainstream cinema, the zombie is one of the few monsters that has moved directly from folklore to the popular imagination (McIntosh 2008, 2). McIntosh notes that our fascination with zombies seems to trace back to Haitian folklore via the ethnographies of ethnobiologist Wade Davis. According to his reports, there are two types of literal zombies: The spirit zombies (zombie jardin) and the type that has made its way into popular culture: The body raised from the dead (zombie corps cadavre) (2). The zombies-or victims-are put into a near-death state by means of a poisonous mixture made in part from the toxins of a blowfish and then later revived through the use of another mixture (3). Through this process, the victims end up losing many of their mental faculties, functioning at a much slower pace than normal, allowing them to be easily controlled by the individual who poisoned them. Although such descriptions can be found in a few travelogues dating back to the late eighteenth century, it was not until the US military occupation of Haiti from 1915 to 1934 that Haitian folklore began to make its way out of Haiti and into American news reports and cultural imaginaries (McIntosh 2008, 4). As with many cultural exports, accuracy was not of most importance in disseminating this new information. Instead, a sensationalized and magical image of Haitian voodoo began to be promoted. It was specifically the image of a slowmoving individual in a trance-like state that became the model for the horror monsters we see today. Entering the scene in 1932, with Kenneth Webb's stage production of Zombie, and later that year with the first zombie film, White Zombie (Halperin brothers), the majority of the content of these films dealt with female possession for men's sexual pleasure and/or black-white racial issues (McIntosh 2008, 5). The zombies in these films generally stayed the same, with only a simple change of scenery to suit the era's political climate. For the most part, they were simply slow versions of humans, with less tidy clothing. McIntosh notes that this all changed- And would forever change the face of zombie films thereafter- with George A. Romero's 1968 Night of the Living Dead (8). Both that film and Romero's following two films, Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead, deal with issues pertinent to North American culture. They provide a visual commentary for the horrific aspects of our culture that we normally do not question. Night of the Living Dead predominantly takes place in a family's farmhouse and depicts the characters fighting for their lives against a horde of zombies that threaten to infiltrate from the outside. ""Much of the narrative attention,"" Dendle contends, ""is thus devoted not to attacks or human-zombie conflicts, but to re-examining the middle-class household of heartland America"" (2007, 50). The movement from urban spaces into gated communities allowed individuals to better defend their modern homes, values and ideals against the monstrous ""other"" that lurked outside the door. This apocalyptic sense is also evident in Dawn of the Dead, ""a social commentary on American mass consumer society as zombies overtake survivors barricaded in a shopping mall, and Day of the Dead, when the world is apparently almost completely overrun by zombies and there are only a few survivors left"" (McIntosh 2008, 9). Romero's films are important for the simple reason that they forever changed public perception of the zombie and allow for an intriguing, easily accessible creature that has quickly become the monster of choice for many performances. To properly situate the zombie walk as a performance of subversion and reclamation, the construction of our current city spaces needs to be discussed. How do these spaces limit the possibility for subversion and social upheaval? Also, the zombie walk is a particular type of performance that draws heavily from the Situationist International's theory of détournement: The reclaiming of already existing objects/spaces/ideas found in society and then using them for alternative purposes. Finally, the performance of the undead, though tinged with political curiosity, is a site of extreme playfulness. It is within the space of performance and play that the zombie walk is able to momentarily subvert dominant social norms and replace them with the utterly grotesque. © 2011 by University of Ottawa Press.",,"English",Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-84903678520

The Digital Age has changed the characteristics of language learners themselves. With the pervasive influence of digital technology, most learners in economically developed countries are now either 'digital immigrants' or 'digital natives' (Prensky 2001; Carlson 2005). Digital natives are individuals who have been surrounded by digital technologies all their lives and who cannot easily imagine an existence without applications such as videogames, email, blogs, texting, cell phones, digital cameras and iPods. Digital immigrants are those individuals who grew up without digital technologies but who have become skilled in the use of some of them, albeit generally with 'accented' skills. The Digital Age has opened up a plethora of creative routes for digital language learning, which we define as any type of language learning supported in whole or in part by computer technologies. For instance, Second Life and other 'massively multiplayer online-roleplaying games' are increasingly used for language learning (Oxford 2008b, 2010). Wireless, Internet-connected mobile devices, such as MP3 or MP4 players, are among the most popular and most flexible technology aids at US government language institutes (Center for the Advanced Study of Language 2008), offering dual-channel (visual and auditory) learning, 'augmented realities,' the possibility of new virtual identities and instant connections with other learners (Dede 2005; Oxford 2010). Alelo's Tactical Iraqi offers authentic language and culture instruction delivered in game-like scenario formats to military and other learners, with accurate assessments of progress provided (Nielson, Rockwood and Robertson 2007). Individuals can now benefit from blogging and wikis for language learning (Oxford 2010). However, effectiveness in digital language learning does not magically occur. To be a successful digital language learner, an individual must use relevant language learning strategies. A language learning strategy is a deliberate, goal-oriented action plan that a learner employs to control, regulate, and enhance his or her language learning (Oxford 2011). Many research studies (see those reported in O'Malley and Chamot 1990; Oxford 1990, 1996; Cohen and Macaro 2007; Griffiths 2008) have shown that the use of certain types of learning strategies is related significantly to language proficiency. Appropriate learning strategies make language learning more efficient, more effective and often more enjoyable (Oxford 1990). Among the most salient categories of language learning strategies are cognitive strategies for analysing, synthesising and reasoning; metacognitive strategies for managing and controlling the learning cycle (planning, organising, monitoring and evaluating); and affective and social strategies for dealing with emotional, motivational and interpersonal sides of language learning. The next section presents some of the challenges of digital language learning and depicts the strategic ways by which language learners deal with them. © 2011 by The Hong Kong University Press, HKU.

On the other hand, service differentiation based incentive mechanisms are proposed in P2P networks, which basically could be provided with two ways: punish defect behavior (punishment-based scheme), or reward cooperative behavior (reward-based scheme). Then the naturally resulted question is that: under the above P2P networking environment, how to effectively design service differentiation based resource-provision incentive mechanisms? Our contributions are threefold. First, we found that the traditional service differentiation based incentive schemes cannot successfully encourage peers to contribute resource to the whole system, irrespective of punishment-based and reward-based schemes. Then, if peers can voluntarily join the system, and small entry fee is set for participation, we obtained that the performance of punishment-based scheme (first providing high-level service plus punishment) is always better than that of reward-based scheme (first providing low-level service plus reward). Finally, unlike the existing result that was based on persistent users' identities and truly repeated interactions, we illustrate that punisher's average payoff in punishment-based scheme is almost same as the ideal but unfeasible case of reward-based scheme: rewarder could selectively reward other rewarders, and reward cost is zero. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, unplanned punishments must provably cease in order to avoid infinite cycles of unsynchronised behaviour of 'tit for tat'. We investigate another aspect of these systems. We consider the possibility of subsystem takeover. The takeover may lead to joint deviations coordinated by an arbitrary selfish-computer that controls an unknown group of subordinate computers. We present strategies that deter the coordinator from deviating in infinitely repeated games. We construct deterministic automata that implement these strategies with optimal complexity.

This holds not only for chronic diseases like asthma and diabetes, but also for the field of child psychotherapy. At the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry of Zürich University, the video game Treasure Hunt was developed to support psychotherapeutic treatment of children between eight and thirteen years of age. Treasure Hunt does not replace the therapist but supports treatment by offering attractive electronic work assignments. The scope of this article is an overview on health games for children and a description of Treasure Hunt. After the explanation of its therapeutic potentials, an evaluation based on questionnaires for therapists and children will be presented. 124 therapists answered a questionnaire on their impression of the game three months after download. 41 therapists were willing to participate in the further evaluation and sent questionnaires of 200 children with whom Treasure Hunt had been used. A limitation of these data is that a positive bias can not be excluded, as therapists with a positive attitude towards psychotherapeutic computer games were more likely to answer the questionnaire. 118 therapists (95.2%) considered Treasure Hunt a useful tool in child psychotherapy. 197 children (98.5%) report being satisfied with the use of the game during treatment. Treasure Hunt was predominantly used for the age group it is designed for and both, by very experienced and by young therapists. Eleven diagnostic categories reflect a broader range of indications than expected. © Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht GmbH & Co.

This study examines correlates of patterns of and motivations for playing video games while using or feeling the effects of a substance (concurrent use). Data were drawn from a nationally-representative survey of adult Americans who ""regularly"" or ""occasionally"" played video games and had played for at least one hour in the past seven days (n = 3,380). Only recent concurrent users' data were included in analyses (n = 1,196). Independent variables included demographics, substance use frequency and problems, game genre of concurrent use (identified by looking titles up in an industry database), and general game playing variables including problem video game play (PVP), consumer involvement, enjoyment, duration, and frequency of play. Exploratory factor analysis identified the following dimensions underlying patterns of and motivations for concurrent use: pass time or regulate negative emotion, enhance an already enjoyable or positive experience, and use of video games and substances to remediate each other's undesirable effects. Multivariate regression analyses indicated PVP and hours/day of video game play were associated with most patterns/motivations, as were caffeine, tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, and painkiller use problems. This suggests that concurrent use with some regular situational pattern or effect-seeking motivation is part of the addictive process underlying both PVP and substance dependence. Various demographic, game playing, game genre of concurrent use, and substance use variables were associated with specific motivations/patterns, indicating that all are important in understanding concurrent use. © 2011 by the authors.

Design: This is a cross-sectional study of 282 overweight or obese adolescents aged 14-18 years (86 males, 196 females) assessed at baseline prior to beginning a lifestyle intervention study for weight control. Sedentary behaviours, defined as hours per day spent watching TV, playing video games, recreational computer use and total screen time were measured by self-report. We examined the associations between sedentary behaviours and BP and lipids using multiple linear regression. Results: Seated video gaming was the only sedentary behaviour associated with elevated BP and lipids before and after adjustment for age, sex, pubertal stage, parental education, body mass index (BMI), caloric intake, percent intake in dietary fat, physical activity (PA) duration, and PA intensity. Specifically, video gaming remained positively associated with systolic BP (adjusted r = 0.13, β = 1.1, p<0.05) and total cholesterol/HDL ratio (adjusted r = 0.12, β = 0.14, p<0.05). Conclusions: Playing video games was the only form of sedentary behaviour that was independently associated with increased BP and lipids. Our findings provide support for reducing time spent playing seated video games as a possible means to promote health and prevent the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in this high risk group of overweight and obese adolescents. Future research is needed to first replicate these findings and subsequently aim to elucidate the mechanisms linking seated video gaming and elevated BP and lipids in this high risk population.

Participants were randomly assigned to play a violent or nonviolent video game before completing a task in which they could behave aggressively. Results showed that participants high in trait anger were the most aggressive, but only if they first played a VVG.

The present study examined whether chronic exposure to VVGs was associated with alterations in emotional long-term memory. Participants completed an old-new recognition task with 300 pictures of scenes ranging in emotion (negative, neutral and positive). We analysed accuracy and reaction time data using diffusion modelling to test a desensitization hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, VVG players would show reduced memory or a less liberal response bias for negative stimuli, compared with nonplayers. Contrary to the desensitization hypothesis, VVG exposure was not associated with differences in memory or response bias. This result suggests that, unlike other cognitive domains, long-term memory may be robust to deleterious influences of chronic VVG exposure.

Recently, research has demonstrated that interactive games using turn-taking and imitation have yielded positive results with autistic children who have impaired communication or social skills (Barakova and Brok in Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Entertainment Computing, pp. 115-126, 2010). This paper describes a robot that plays interactive imitation games using hand and face tracking. The robot is equipped with a head and two arms, each with two degrees of freedom, and a camera. We trained a human hands detector and subsequently, used this detector along with a standard face tracker to create two autonomous interactive games: single-player (""Imitate Me, Imitate You"") and two-player (""Pass the Pose"".) Additionally, we implemented a third setting in which the robot is teleoperated by remote control. In ""Imitate Me, Imitate You"", the robot has both passive and active game modes. In the passive mode, the robot waits for the child to initiate an interaction by raising one or both hands. In the second game mode, the robot initiates interactions. The ""Pass the Pose"" game engages two children in cooperative play by enlisting the robot as a mediator between two children alternately initiating and imitating poses. These games are designed to increase attention, promote turn-taking skills and encourage child-led verbal and nonverbal communication through simple imitative play. This research makes two specific contributions: (1) We present a low-cost robot design which measures and adapts to a child's actions during interactive games and, (2) we train, test and make freely available, a new hand detector, based on Haar-like features, which is usable in various kinds of human-robot interactions.

Electrical activity of the heart simultaneously induces a magnetic field. Detection of this magnetic activity will enable non-contact, noninvasive evaluation to be made. We improved the sensitivity of a pulse-driven magnetoimpedance (PMI) sensor, which is used as an electric compass in mobile phones and as a motion sensor of the operation handle in computer games, toward a pico-Tesla (pT) level, and measured magnetic fields on the surface of the thoracic wall in humans. The changes in magnetic field detected by this sensor synchronized with the electric activity of the electrocardiogram (ECG). The shape of the magnetic wave was largely altered by shifting the sensor position within 20 mm in parallel and/or perpendicular to the thoracic wall. The magnetic activity was maximal in the 4th intercostals near the center of the sterna. Furthermore, averaging the magnetic activity at 15 mm in the distance between the thoracic wall and the sensor demonstrated magnetic waves mimicking the P wave and QRS complex. The present study shows the application of PMI sensor in detecting cardiac magnetic activity in several healthy subjects, and suggests future applications of this technology in medicine and biology. © 2011 Nakayama et al.",22022453,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053941225

Physiological arousal (skin conductance levels) was assessed during game play and participants reported their sense of presence in the game. Results indicate that violence cues influence brand logo memory through engagement and affect attitude change via arousal. Although physiological arousal led to positive change in brand attitude, it does not significantly influence logo memory. Conversely, although higher levels of spatial presence led to better logo memory, there was a corresponding reduction in attitude change for highly recognized brands. We consider the possibility that increased memory but negative attitude change with higher presence in violent video games could deter advertisers from placing their messages inside violent games. © 2011 American Academy of Advertising.

In addition, it is hard to understand and study the psychology of UX in games. The objective of this study is to show how UX differs when the first-person shooter HALO is played in a laboratory and at home. To disclose this difference, a psychologically valid and multidimensional measurement framework is introduced. UX is profiled according to the level of the sense of presence, involvement, and flow in a between-subjects design. Statistically, the structure of the framework is grounded on a large and heterogeneous gamer data set (N = 2,182). The results showed that the profile of the sense of presence in the laboratory included higher levels of attention and arousal as compared with that of the natural environment. This finding was independent of any of the measured background variables. Other differences between the two situations were more related to the participants' background. For example, gamers at home were more involved in the game and they felt a higher level of competence. No strong emotional differences between the two situations were found.

The study investigates the impact of level design on brainwave activity measured with EEG and on player experience measured with questionnaires. The goal of the study was to investigate cognition, emotion, and player behavior from a psychological perspective. For this purpose, a methodology for assessing gameplay experience with subjective and objective measures was developed extending prior work in physiological measurements of affect in digital gameplay.

These changes are attributable, in part, to the developments of a number of aerospace, learning and other leading-edge technologies and their synergistic combinations and convergence. The related technologies include ubiquitous, cloud, and petascale/exascale computing; ultrahigh-bandwidth networks; pervasive wireless communication; intelligent autonomous robotics; artificial general intelligence; powerful game engines and facilities; networked immersive virtual environments and virtual worlds; augmented and enhanced reality; and novel human-technology interfaces. This paper describes some of the frontiers of, and challenges in, future aerospace systems and the drivers for transformative changes in aerospace engineering education. The need to have a holistic perspective and a comprehensive approach for aerospace education, research, training, and accelerated workforce development is outlined. A starting point to accomplish this task is the development of an intelligent adaptive cyber-physical ecosystem for the aerospace workforce. The continuously expanding major components of the ecosystem include integrated knowledge discovery and exploitation facilities; novel agent-supported visual simulations (with cognitive learning and understanding abilities); immersive three-dimensional (3D) virtual world facilities; intelligent, multimodal and humanlike interfaces; and smart mobile wireless devices. The ecosystem will provide timely, engaging, personalized/collaborative, and tailored visual learning.

It was furthermore shown that reward prediction errors are adaptively scaled with respect to the range of possible outcomes, enabling sensitive encoding for a large range of reward values. Congruently, neuroimaging studies in humans demonstrated that BOLD-responses in the ventral striatum encode reward prediction errors in similar fashion as dopaminergic midbrain neurons, suggesting that these BOLD-responses may be driven by dopaminergic midbrain activity. However, neuroimaging results are ambiguous with respect to the adaptive scaling of reward prediction errors, leading to the conjecture that under certain circumstances other than dopaminergic midbrain input may drive ventral striatal BOLD-responses. The goal of this study was to substantiate whether BOLD-responses in the ventral striatum rather respond to adaptively scaled reward prediction errors or absolute reward magnitude. In addition, we aimed to identify neuronal structures modulating activity in the ventral striatum. Sixteen healthy participants played a wheel of fortune game, where they could win three differently valued rewards while being scanned. BOLD-responses increased after gaining rewards; this gain was however independent of the absolute reward magnitude. In contrast BOLD-responses upon reward omission decreased with reward magnitude. A psychophysiological interaction analysis identified a cluster in the brainstem in proximity of the dorsal raphe nucleus, a cluster in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, and a cluster in the rostral cingulate zone. These clusters changed their connectivity with the ventral striatum in relation to the absolute reward magnitude in reward omission trials. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The participants consisted of 83 female and 94 male adolescents with a mean age of 17.6 years. The dependent variables are memory for previously learnt verbal and visual material, memory for media-related content and physiological measures of stress (heart rate, cortisol, salivary alpha-amylase). Besides the group comparisons, potential mediation effects and gender differences were examined. The results show that violent content leads to a poorer memory performance for verbal material and to an increased heart rate. The heart rate, however, does not mediate the effect on memory performance. Genders differ regarding their abilities to memorise verbal and visual material, with females showing a better performance (independent of the experimental condition), and for memorising media-contents, where the males outperform females (also independent of experimental condition).

High aerobic intensity training (HIT) improve peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak), net mechanical efficiency of walking and risk factors for CVD but has not been investigated in patients with schizophrenia. Aims: To investigate effects from HIT on VO2peak, net mechanical efficiency of walking and risk factors for CVD in patients with schizophrenia. Methods: 25 inpatients (F2029, ICD-10) were allocated to either HIT or playing computer games (CG), 3 days per week for 8 weeks. HIT consisted of 4 × - 4-min intervals with 3-min break periods, at 8595% and 70% of peak heart rate, respectively. Results: 12 and seven patients completed HIT and CG, respectively. The baseline VO2peak in both groups combined (n = 19) was 36.8 ± 8.2 ml/kg/min and 3.12 ± 0.55 l/min. The HIT group improved VO2peak by 12% from 3.17 ± 0.59 to 3.56 ± 0.68 l/min (P < 0.001), more than the CG group (P = 0.014).

Both P3 and delta EEG showed a processing trade-off between game and oddball tasks, but only some game events showed reduced attention requirements with practice. Training magnified a transient increase in alpha power following both primary and secondary task events. This contrasted with alpha suppression observed when the oddball task was performed alone, suggesting that alpha may be related to attention switching.

J Strength Cond Res 25(9): 2410-2417, 2011-The purposes of this study were to examine the activity profile of elite adolescent players during regular team handball games and to compare the physical and motor performance of players between the first and second halves of a match. Activity patterns (video analysis) and heartrate (HR) responses (telemetry) were monitored in top nationaldivision adolescent players (18 men, aged 15.1 ± 0.6 years) throughout 6 regulation games (25-minute halves with a 10- minute interval). The total distance covered a meraged 1,777 ± 264 m per game (7.4% less in the second than in the first half, p &gt; 0.05). Players ran 170 ± 24 m at high intensity and 866 12 m at maximal speed, with 3266 bouts of running (duration 2.36 0.3 seconds) at speeds &gt; 18 km·h -1; they stood still for 16% of the playing time. The mean HR during play was 172 ± 2 b·min -1 (82 ± 3% of maximal HR). Blood lactate concentrations at the end of the first and second halves were 9.7 ± 1.1 and 8.3 ± 0.9 mmol·L -1, respectively (difference p &lt; 0.05). We conclude that adolescent handball players cover less distance and engage in fewer technical actions in the second half of a match. This indicates that team handball is physiologically very demanding.

While current literature has been mainly focused on the use of agents within robotics or software engineering applications, this paper proposes a novel usage model for self-organizing agents suitable for wireless communication networks. In the proposed model, a number of agents are required to collect data from several arbitrarily located tasks. Each task represents a queue of packets that require collection and subsequent wireless transmission by the agents to a central receiver. The problem is modeled as a hedonic coalition formation game between the agents and the tasks that interact in order to form disjoint coalitions. Each formed coalition is modeled as a polling system consisting of a number of agents, designated as collectors, which move between the different tasks present in the coalition, collect and transmit the packets. Within each coalition, some agents might also take the role of a relay for improving the packet success rate of the transmission. The proposed hedonic coalition formation algorithm allows the tasks and the agents to take distributed decisions to join or leave a coalition, based on the achieved benefit in terms of effective throughput, and the cost in terms of polling system delay. As a result of these decisions, the agents and tasks structure themselves into independent disjoint coalitions which constitute a Nash-stable network partition. Moreover, the proposed coalition formation algorithm allows the agents and tasks to adapt the topology to environmental changes, such as the arrival of new tasks, the removal of existing tasks, or the mobility of the tasks. Simulation results show how the proposed algorithm allows the agents and tasks to self-organize into independent coalitions, while improving the performance, in terms of average player (agent or task) payoff, of at least 30.26 percent (for a network of five agents with up to 25 tasks) relatively to a scheme that allocates nearby tasks equally among agents. © 2011 IEEE.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960783359

Previous research notes ventral striatal activity and dopamine release increases with maternal attachment but decreases in major depressive disorder. This study tests the hypothesis that striatal response to reward is altered in PPD. Methods: Subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging blood oxygenation level-dependent acquisition during a fast event-related card-guessing, monetary reward task. Time series data from an independent sample of 10 healthy mothers were used to establish the ventral striatal region of interest (ROI). Repeated-measures analysis of variance of time series data in the established ROI was then conducted for a discrete group of healthy (n = 12) and depressed, unmedicated mothers (n = 12). Results: Data from the independent sample of 10 healthy mothers established an ROI in the left ventral striatum (-13, 12, -4, 477 mm 3), with cluster significance p &lt;.01, corrected. There was a significant quadratic interaction of time × group [F(1,22) = 5.22, p =.032] in this ROI in the healthy (n = 12) and depressed mothers (n = 12). This effect represents a nonlinear attenuation of ventral striatal response with time that was greater in depressed than healthy mothers.

The complete driving architecture consists of six simple modules, each one responsible for a basic aspect of car driving. Three modules use simple functions to control gear shifting, steering movements, and pedal positions. A fourth manages speed control by means of a simple fuzzy system. The other two modules are in charge of (i) adapting the driving behaviour to the presence of other cars, and (ii) implementing a basic 'inter-lap' learning mechanism in order to remember key track segments and adapt the speed accordingly in future laps. The controller was evaluated in two ways. First, in runs without adversaries over several track designs, our controller allowed some of the longest distances to be covered in a set time in comparison with data from other previous controllers, and second, as a participant in the 2009 Simulated Car Racing Competition which it ended up winning. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960091777

Design/methodology/approach: The American College Health Association's National College Health Assessment (ACHA-NCHA), a 58-item anonymous survey, was distributed to all graduate health science students during a five-week period in the spring semester. Findings: Students (n=1,355) were most likely to report a negative perceived academic impact related to psychosocial concerns such as stress, depression/anxiety, and relationship problems. The students' most pressing felt concerns were upper respiratory infections, stress, concerns about troubled loved ones and sleep difficulties. Clinical graduate students (n=712) were significantly more likely to report negative academic impacts related to upper respiratory infections (p=0.001), concern about a troubled friend or family member (p=0.001), sleep difficulties (p=0.005), relationship difficulties (p=0.030), and internet use/computer games (p=0.015) than non-clinical graduate students. However, the magnitude of those differences was small. Practical implications: This paper adds to one's knowledge of student health concerns, which may help to address health-related barriers to learning. Originality/value: This paper presents findings that further explicate the reciprocal relationship between student health and learning by suggesting methodology to identify priority health issues among a graduate student population. Findings from this study of over 20 different health concerns indicate that the priority health concerns of graduate health science students are primarily psychological and psychosocial health issues. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052594387

For this purpose, common biosignal feature extraction methods were exploited and their capability to identify boredom was assessed. Moreover, for the first time, Legendre and Krawtchouk moments, as well as novel moment variations, were extracted as biosignal features and their potential toward automatic affect recognition was examined using the specific application scenario. The present analysis was conducted with ECG and GSR data collected from 19 different subjects, while boredom was naturally induced during the repetitive playing of a 3D video game. Conventional biosignal features as well as moment-based ones were found to be effective for the automatic recognition of boredom by achieving classification accuracies around 85 percent. Then, the joint use of moments and moment variations with conventional features was found to significantly improve classification accuracy by producing a maximum correct classification ratio of 94.17 percent. © 2011 IEEE.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857802675

The present study, in which participants were excluded during a ball-tossing game, examined whether (reminders of) secure attachment relationships could attenuate neurophysiological pain- and stress-related responses to social exclusion. Social exclusion was associated with activation in brain areas implicated in the regulation and experience of social distress, including areas in the lateral and medial prefrontal cortex, ventral anterior cingulate cortex, and hypothalamus. However, less activation in these areas was found to the extent that participants felt more securely attached to their attachment figure.

However, the influence of this sedentary activity on food intake is unknown. Objective: The objective was to examine the acute effects of sedentary video game play on various components of energy balance. Design: With the use of a randomized crossover design, 22 healthy, normal-weight, male adolescents (mean ± SD age: 16.7 ± 1.1 y) completed two 1-h experimental conditions, namely video game play and rest in a sitting position, followed by an ad libitum lunch. The endpoints were spontaneous food intake, energy expenditure, stress markers, appetite sensations, and profiles of appetite-related hormones. Results: Heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, sympathetic tone, and mental workload were significantly higher during the video game play condition than during the resting condition (P < 0.05). Although energy expenditure was significantly higher during video game play than during rest (mean increase over resting: 89 kJ; P < 0.01), ad libitum energy intake after video game play exceeded that measured after rest by 335 kJ (P < 0.05). A daily energy surplus of 682 kJ (163 kcal) over resting (P , 0.01) was observed in the video game play condition. The increase in food intake associated with video game play was observed without increased sensations of hunger and was not compensated for during the rest of the day. Finally, the profiles of glucose, insulin, cortisol, and ghrelin did not suggest an up-regulation of appetite during the video game play condition. Conclusion: A single session of video game play in healthy male adolescents is associated with an increased food intake, regardless of appetite sensations.

In order to facilitate an effective outcome when teaching the basic principles of hand and respiratory hygiene, educational interventions should first target school children. As computer games are ubiquitous in most children's lives, e-Bug developed computer games targeted at teaching children handwashing, respiratory hygiene and antibiotic resistance. The games were designed for two target audiences: junior school children (9-12 year olds); and senior school children (13-15 year olds). Between May and August 2009, the finalized junior game underwent an evaluation in three UK schools (in Glasgow, Gloucester and London), involving 62 children in the schools and ~ 1700 players accessing the junior game online. The e-Bug junior game consists of a number of levels of play, each of which promotes a set of learning outcomes (LOs). These LOs, complementary to those in the e-Bug packs, are expressed through the game mechanics (the rules of the game) rather than through story or dialogue. Although the junior game's evaluation demonstrated a statistically significant change in the knowledge for only a small number of given LOs, because many children had the required knowledge already before playing the game, this is e-Bug's first statistical study on the junior game and the first comprehensive evaluation of its kind.

Results revealed less congruent reactions to happy expressions and even incongruent reactions to sad and angry expressions in the competition condition, whereas virtually no differences between the neutral and the cooperation condition occurred. Effects on congruent reactions were found to be mediated by cognitive empathy, indicating that the state of empathy plays an important role in the situational modulation of congruent reactions. Further, incongruent reactions to sad and angry faces in a competition setting were mediated by the emotional reaction of joy, supporting the assumption that incongruent facial reactions are mainly based on affective processes.

We then consider agents that act as creatures of habit by increasing their preference to coordinate (anticoordinate) with whichever neighbors they are coordinated (anticoordinated) with at present. These preferences change slowly while the system is repeatedly perturbed, so that it settles to many different local attractors. We find that under these conditions, with each perturbation there is a progressively higher chance of the system settling to a configuration with high total utility. Eventually, only one attractor remains, and that attractor is very likely to maximize (or almost maximize) global utility. This counterintuitive result can be understood using theory from computational neuroscience; we show that this simple form of habituation is equivalent to Hebbian learning, and the improved optimization of global utility that is observed results from well-known generalization capabilities of associative memory acting at the network scale. This causes the system of selfish agents, each acting individually but habitually, to collectively identify configurations that maximize total utility. © 2011 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",21554113,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960498770

If antibiotic use could be reduced, the tide of increasing resistance could be stemmed. e-Bug is a European project involving 18 European countries, partly funded by The Directorate-General for Health and Consumers (DG SANCO) of the European Commission. It aims to develop and disseminate across Europe a junior and senior school teaching pack and web site (hosting the lesson plans and complementary games) that teach young people about prudent antibiotic use, microbes, transmission of infection, hygiene and vaccines. The aim of e-Bug is to increase young people's understanding, through enjoyable activities, of why it is so important to use antibiotics correctly in order to control antibiotic resistance, and to have good hand and respiratory hygiene to help reduce the spread of infection. Within the senior school pack the sexual transmission of infections has also been included, as the peak age of chlamydial infection is in 16-24 year olds. Teachers, young people and the consortium of 18 countries were closely involved with agreeing learning outcomes and developing the resource activities. Young people helped create the characters and microbe artwork. The resources have been translated, adapted for and disseminated to schools across 10 countries in Europe, and endorsed by the relevant government departments of health and education. The web site has been accessed from >200 countries. The resources will be translated into all European Union languages, and have been used to promote European Antibiotic Awareness Day and better hand and respiratory hygiene during the influenza pandemic in 2009. © The Author 2011.

The trustees varied in regard to fairness and presence of emotional facial cues which were both linked to repayment ratio. BPD patients adjusted their investment to the fairness of their partner. In contrast, nonpatients disregarded the trustees' fairness in the presence of emotional facial expressions. Both groups performed equally in an emotion recognition task and assessed the trustees' fairness comparably. When the unfair trustee provided emotional cues, BPD patients assessed their own behavior as more fair, while the lack of cues led patients to assess their own behavior as unfair. BPD patients are superior in the attribution of mental states to interaction partners when emotional cues are present.

We investigated associations among physical activity (outdoor and indoor sporting activities), sedentary behaviors (including screen time, television [TV] viewing, and computer and videogame usage), and retinal microvascular caliber in schoolchildren. Methods and Results- Six-year-old students (1765/2238) from a random cluster sample of 34 Sydney schools were examined. Parents completed questionnaires about physical and sedentary activities. Retinal images were taken, and retinal vessel caliber was quantified. After adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, eye color, axial length, body mass index, birth weight, and mean arterial blood pressure, children who spent more time in outdoor sporting activities (in the highest tertile of activity) had 2.2 μm (95% CI 0.65 to 3.71) wider mean retinal arteriolar caliber than those in the lowest tertile (Ptrend=0.004). Increasing quartiles of time spent watching TV were associated with narrower mean retinal arteriolar caliber 2.3 μm (95% CI 0.73 to 3.92), P trend=0.003. Conclusion- These data suggest that physical activity could have a beneficial influence, whereas screen time has a potential adverse influence on retinal microvascular structure. The magnitude of arteriolar narrowing associated with each hour daily of TV viewing is similar to that associated with a 10-mm Hg increase in systolic blood pressure in children.

Objective: We evaluated (1) whether Feno levels were increased in children with allergic sensitization or asthma; (2) whether specific allergen exposure increased Feno levels in sensitized, but not unsensitized, children; and (3) whether sedentary behavior increased Feno levels independent of allergen exposures. Methods: At age 12 years, in a birth cohort of children with a parental history of allergy or asthma, we measured bed dust allergen (dust mite, cat, and cockroach) by means of ELISA, specific allergic sensitization primarily based on specific IgE levels, and respiratory disease (current asthma, rhinitis, and wheeze) and hours of television viewing/video game playing by means of questionnaire. Children performed spirometric maneuvers before and after bronchodilator responses and had Feno levels measured by using electrochemical detection methods (NIOX MINO). Results: Feno levels were increased in children with current asthma (32.2 ppb), wheeze (27.0 ppb), or rhinitis (23.2 ppb) compared with subjects without these respective symptoms/diagnoses (16.4-16.6 ppb, P < .005 for all comparisons). Allergic sensitization to indoor allergens (cat, dog, and dust mite) predicted higher Feno levels and explained one third of the variability in Feno levels. Feno levels were highest in children both sensitized and exposed to dust mite. Greater than 10 hours of weekday television viewing was associated with a 0.64-log increase in Feno levels after controlling for indoor allergen exposure, body mass index, and allergic sensitization. Conclusion: Allergen exposures and sedentary behavior (television viewing/video game playing) might increase airway inflammation, which was measured as the Feno. © 2011 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.",21463890,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955634446

However I argue that it is not in fact images of death or the dead that are problematic but those images which present or evoke evidence of the emotions associated with death, and create a situation where we imagine the circumstances of our own deaths or the death of those we love. Images of the dead are acceptable as long as they do not cause pain to the living, as in a video game fantasy or a fiction, or are seen as other and distant.

We administered the PDT before and after random assignment of participants to a laboratory stressor - failure versus success feedback regarding their performance on a challenging computer game.

Students from three ninth-grade classrooms were assigned to one of three groups: one group used an expert generated concept map, one group constructed their own concept maps, and a control group used no map. It was predicted that the use of concept maps would enhance the educational value of the game playing activity, in particular students' motivational levels; however, the opposite happened. Students who used a concept map showed lower motivation on the task relative to their baseline motivation for regular classroom instruction. In contrast, the levels of motivation in playing the game, for students in the control group, met or exceeded their levels of motivation during regular classroom instruction. These results suggest that using a conceptual scaffold can decrease students' motivation to learn classroom material through game play, perhaps because conceptual maps can (a) focus students' attention on the difficulty of learning the concepts and on the extrinsic rewards for playing the game and (b) make game play less autonomous, less creative, and less active. All of these can negate the primary property that provides playing its principal potential pedagogical power: fun. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The identification of poker as a useful research domain has inevitably resulted in increased attention from academic researchers who have pursued many separate avenues of research in the area of computer poker. The poker domain has often featured in previous review papers that focus on games in general, however a comprehensive review paper with a specific focus on computer poker has so far been lacking in the literature. In this paper, we present a review of recent algorithms and approaches in the area of computer poker, along with a survey of the autonomous poker agents that have resulted from this research. We begin with the first serious attempts to create strong computerised poker players by constructing knowledge-based and simulation-based systems. This is followed by the use of computational game theory to construct robust poker agents and the advances that have been made in this area. Approaches to constructing exploitive agents are reviewed and the challenging problems of creating accurate and dynamic opponent models are addressed. Finally, we conclude with a selection of alternative approaches that have received attention in previously published material and the interesting problems that they pose. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we examined the extent to which testosterone and cortisol responses to social exclusion would predict subsequent reactive aggression. Men were randomly assigned to a social exclusion (SE) or inclusion (SI) condition of 'Cyberball', a computer ball-toss game. Aggression was then measured using the Point Subtraction Aggression Paradigm (PSAP). Saliva was collected at three points for the measurement of testosterone and cortisol. Regression analyses indicated that testosterone concentrations 10-min into the PSAP (controlling for pre- and post-Cyberball testosterone) were positively correlated with aggressive behaviour, irrespective of SI/SE. Post hoc analyses for the conditions separately, however, suggested the relationship was stronger for SI men (R2 change=13.3%, F1, 29=5.28, p=0.03) than for SE men (R2 change=1.8%, F1, 26=0.49, p=0.49). Aggressive behaviour was also positively correlated with cortisol concentrations 10-min into the PSAP (controlling for pre- and post-Cyberball cortisol) irrespective of SE/SI. When both hormones were included in the regression model, the interaction of baseline 'Cortisol'×'Testosterone'×'Experimental Group' approached significance (R2 change=5.4%, F1, 55=3.53, p=0.07), but no significant effects were observed in either group alone. The findings add to evidence that individual differences in state neuroendocrine function map onto variability in human social behaviour. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",21382439,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-79953302198

Methods: The study was conducted on 32 healthy adult male student volunteers who had never practiced meditation before the study. The study consisted of practicing 20 minutes of guided meditation and administration of psychologic stress to the subjects. The psychologic stress was administered to the subjects by asking them to play a (preselected) stressful computer game. The subjects were asked to meditate either before or after the administration of psychologic stress. For the control group measurements, the subjects were asked to wait quietly for an equivalent period of meditation time. Outcome measures: The outcome measures were galvanic skin response (GSR), heart rate (HR), electromyography (EMG), sympathetic reactivity (QTc/QS2 ratio), cortisol, and acute psychologic stress scores. The central nervous system functions were assessed using Wechsler memory scale and visual-choice reaction time (VCRT). These parameters were measured both at the beginning and at the end of the intervention, using a pre-post experimental test design. Results: Computer game stress was associated with a significant increase in physiologic (GSR, EMG, HR, QTc/QS2) and psychologic (acute stress questionnaire scores) markers of stress. Meditation was associated with relaxation (significant decrease in GSR, EMG, QTc/QS2, and acute stress questionnaire scores). Meditation, if practiced before the stressful event, reduced the adverse effects of stress. Memory quotient significantly increased, whereas cortisol level decreased after both stress and meditation. VCRT showed no significant change. Conclusions: Practice of meditation produced a relaxation response even in the young adult subjects who had never practiced meditation before. The practice of meditation reduced the physiologic stress responses without taking away the beneficial effect of stress, namely, improved memory scores. © Copyright 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",21417807,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952947673

The Uncanny Valley phenomenon implies that virtual characters approaching full human-likeness will evoke a negative reaction from the viewer, due to aspects of the character's appearance and behavior differing from the human norm. This study investigates if ""uncanniness"" is increased for a character with a perceived lack of facial expression in the upper parts of the face. More important, our study also investigates if the magnitude of this increased uncanniness varies depending on which emotion is being communicated. Individual parameters for each facial muscle in a 3D model were controlled for the six emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness and surprise in addition to a neutral expression. The results indicate that even fully and expertly animated characters are rated as more uncanny than humans and that, in virtual characters, a lack of facial expression in the upper parts of the face during speech exaggerates the uncanny by inhibiting effective communication of the perceived emotion, significantly so for fear, sadness, disgust, and surprise but not for anger and happiness.

This chapter reviews current research on the topic, which has focused on how media violence effects on arousal, affect, cognition and behaviour. Most evidence comes from television and video games research and the differential effects of these two types of media on the individual are examined. Additional evidence from studies on the Internet effects and music and lyrics is also provided. The main short and long-term effects of media violence are also discussed, suggesting different explanatory models. Another important distinction examined relates to the types of violence displayed on the media. Most of the effects of media violence relate to the development, over-learning and reinforcement of aggression-related knowledge structures, including hostile attribution bias, aggressive actions against others, expectations of violence, positive attitudes towards violence, the belief that violence is acceptable and appropriate to solve problems, and desensitization. Although aggressive and antisocial behavior is affected by media violence, there is also evidence that a raw amount of media use, regardless of its violent content, has an impact on behavior. The social perspective of the individual mediates the relation between raw media use and behavior. This is explained in terms of the lack of role-taking opportunities that media provide, compared to other sources of socialization. The inability to adopt another's perspective and the lack of opportunities for cognitive de-centering and the reduction of egocentric bias limit the adolescent's capacity to calculate the consequences of own behavior. It also limits his/her understanding of the needs, feelings, desires, purposes, and worries of other people. Individuals in this situation would be unable to grasp the most direct consequences of their behavior and, consequently, would be more likely to engage in antisocial conducts. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

This study assesses whether a specific pathway between a cognitive deficit and behaviour via environmental interaction can exist in individuals with PWS.Methods Four individuals with PWS participated in a series of three single-case experiments including laboratory-based and natural environment designs. Cognitive (computer-based) challenges placed varying demands on attention switching or controlled for the cognitive demands of the tasks while placing no demands on switching. Unexpected changes to routines or expectations were presented in controlled games, or imposed on participants' natural environments and compared with control conditions during which no unexpected changes occurred. Behaviour was observed and heart rate was measured.Results Participants showed significantly increased temper outburst related behaviours during cognitive challenges that placed demands on attention switching, relative to the control cognitive challenges. Participants showed significantly increased temper outburst related behaviours when unexpected changes occurred in an experimental or the natural environment compared with when no changes occurred.Conclusions Difficult behaviours that could be triggered reliably in an individual by a specific cognitive demand could also be triggered via manipulation of the environment.

However, the expectations we generate on the basis of people's emotions can mismatch their actual behaviour in certain circumstances, which generates conflict. In the present study, we explored the neural mechanisms of emotional conflict during interpersonal interactions. Participants had to accept or reject economic offers made by several partners who displayed emotional expressions. On every trial, a cue informed participants of whether they could trust the emotion of their partner or not. Trustworthy (low-conflict) partners with happy facial expressions were cooperative and those with angry expressions did not cooperate. Untrustworthy (high-conflict) partners, on the other hand, cooperated when their expression was angry and did not cooperate when they displayed a happy emotion. Behavioural responses were faster for trustworthy than for untrustworty partners. High-conflict partners activated the anterior cingulate and the anterior insula. In turn, trustworthy partners were associated with activations in the left precuneus. Our results suggest that the emotion displayed by another person affects our decision-making in social contexts. When emotional expressions are linked to their natural consequences, they engage ToM processes. In contrast, untrustworthy emotional expressions engage conflict-related brain regions. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.",20736070,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-78649686231

It is argued that key to understanding what serious games encapsulate is to look beyond these characteristics. This article proposes a definition and way to frame serious games technologies, applications and environments along a continuum of gaming characteristics or gameness. From those with traditional gaming activities and characteristics (challenge, play, fun, etc.) at one end to those with minimal traditional gaming characteristics at the other end, whose main purpose is to provide experience and emotion to convey meaning. The main advantages of the definition and continuum are to establish a shared understanding and arena for current and emerging serious games, frame and connect currently fragmented groups into a cohesive serious games movement and community and open opportunities for future collaborative research and development.

Many exergames have the capability to measure activity levels unobtrusively through monitors built into game equipment, and preliminary analysis indicates that exergame measures are significantly correlated with external measures of caloric expenditure, duration of play, and balance. Exergames also have unique capabilities to measure additional data, such as the game challenges, player movement, and levels of performance that affect aerobic activity.

Between March and May 2007 activity-promoting video games ("" apvg"" ) were offered to all 84 inpatients (aged 13-28 years) registered in a long-term rehabilitation programme on a voluntary base. Reasons for (non-)attendance were assessed. Frequency and duration of use of the activity-promoting video game sessions were documented. Furthermore, heart rate and activity counts during use of ""apvg"", endurance training, and strength training were measured. Of 84 inpatients, 51 used the ""apvg"" at least once (69%) over the study period.

The Nintendo Wii is one such system. Interactive gaming can promote intensive task-based therapy in a manner that is motivating for the user. Widespread enthusiasm for consoles and their games prompted us to analyze the games for their rehabilitation elements related to improving balance and mobility for individuals poststroke. Purpose: The purpose of this article is to provide a game analysis for clinical application and evaluation of the game elements for research on interactive video gaming. Methods: Using a team of game players and raters, 5 tables (1 for the Wii Sports and 4 for the Wii Fit) were developed and validated. The tables consist of 3 categories: game description, impairments targeted (strength, endurance, balance, and coordination), and feedback provided (knowledge of performance [KP] and knowledge of results [KR]). Two domain content experts established face validity. Construct validity was performed by 2 therapist-raters who had more than 15 years' clinical experience and postgraduate training in motor learning. Observations about the games including the fidelity of the interfaces, the nature of the feedback, and some of the challenges to adapting the games for rehabilitation are presented. Results: An 80% agreement between raters set as the criterion for establishing the construct validity was met for feedback evaluation. There was 100% agreement on impairment ratings. Games provide a greater amount of KR compared with KP. Conclusion: Given the preponderance of KR, therapists will need to monitor motor performance. Adaptation of interactive video consoles for rehabilitation requires careful evaluation of the games' attributes using relevant rehabilitation construits. © 2011 Thomas Land Publishers, Inc.",22436308,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859741985

A second experiment attempted to control for participants'expectations about the effects of distraction on pain. Forty participants underwent the same experimental procedure, but were given verbal suggestions about the effects of distraction by the experimenter before each distraction condition. Participants in both experiments had a significantly higher pain tolerance and reported less pain with the active distraction compared with passive or no distraction. Participants reported being more absorbed, and were significantly more willing to do the task again when they had the active distraction compared with both passive distraction and no distraction.

The stimuli mainly used in these studies were photos or short film clips. Today, video games and their development frameworks allow researchers to design, model, and animate embodied conversational agents (ECAs). This research paper introduces an experimental setting to observe and measure the perception of facial expression performed by embodied conversational agents. The experimental setup is based on the research efforts of the psychologist Harald G. Wallbott and uses the CryENGINE to visualize the ECAs in various contextual settings. A new paradigm, coined "" Interaction-Paradigm"" , is integrated in the experimental setting, which is derived from the video-games domain. It utilizes the benefits of video games as a research tool: the setup grants participants an interactive experience of a given emotional situation, which allows the investigation of the perception process in a more realistic setting. In contrast to the traditional approaches in emotion theory research, the usage of video games ensures that situational aspects are not presented by simply showing subjects a piece of paper containing descriptions of a situation.Based on an extensive state of the art on using video games and games development frameworks in research, this article shows how to set up experiments using video game technology. The aim of the study is to establish a comparative experimental framework to analyze subjects' judgment on emotional stimuli in different context dimensions. The findings show that the importance of information channels changes, when people decide for the emotional quality of a situation. While in still images the majority of people bases the decision on the facial expression, rather than based on the text description, in interactive scenarios only 11.8% of the participants relied on the facial expressions, with the majority using the contextual description.

However, little is known about the neuromodulators that influence this behavior. In three separate experiments, we investigated the role of serotonin activity, D 2 /D 3 receptor activity, and beta-adrenoceptor activity on the loss chasing of age and IQ-matched healthy adults randomized to treatment or an appropriate control/placebo. In Experiment 1, participants consumed amino-acid drinks that did or did not contain the serotonin precursor, tryptophan. In Experiment 2, participants received a single 176 g dose of the D 2 /D 3 receptor agonist, pramipexole, or placebo. In Experiment 3, participants received a single 80 mg dose of the beta-adrenoceptor blocker, propranolol, or placebo. Following treatment, participants completed a computerized loss-chasing game. Mood and heart rate were measured at baseline and following treatment. Tryptophan depletion significantly reduced the number of decisions made to chase losses, and the number of consecutive decisions to chase, in the absence of marked changes in mood. By contrast, pramipexole significantly increased the value of losses chased and diminished the value of losses surrendered. Propranolol markedly reduced heart rate, but produced no significant changes in loss-chasing behavior. Loss chasing can be thought of as an aversively motivated escape behavior controlled, in part, by the marginal value of continued gambling relative to the value of already accumulated losses. Serotonin and dopamine appear to play dissociable roles in the tendency of individuals to gamble to recover, or to seek to escape from, previous losses. Serotonergic activity seems to promote the availability of loss chasing as a behavioral option, whereas D 2 /D 3 receptor activity produces complex changes in the value of losses judged worth chasing. Sympathetic arousal, at least as mediated by beta-adrenoceptors, does not play a major role in laboratory-based loss-chasing choices. © 2011 American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.

However, ensuring that learning has taken place is the ultimate challenge. Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) have been incorporated into game-based learning environments to guide learners' exploration. Emotions have proven to be deeply intertwined with cognitive and motivational factors. ITSs attempt to recognise and convey emotion in order to enhance students' learning and engagement. The ITS student model is responsible for attainment of adaptability and understanding of learners' needs. It is not clear which emotions are relevant to the teaching-learning experience, or what antecedents and interpersonal differences are involved in determining an emotion. Therefore, student modelling involves uncertainty. Creating an emotional student model that can reason about students' observable behaviour during online game-play is the main goal of our research. The analysis, design and implementation for this model are our central focus here. The model uses as a basis the Control-Value theory of achievement emotions and employs motivational and cognitive variables to determine an emotion.

A probabilistic sample study was carried out with 680 children (7-11 years) from 13 public schools from the city of Sorocaba, SP. A questionnaire containing questions on physical activity, time spent watching television, playing with video games and computers (TV/VG/PC), student and parental antecedents of arterial hypertension, renal or cardiac disease, and economic level was applied. On physical examination, weight, height, waist circumference (WC) and blood pressure (BP) were measured; presence of AN was observed. The prevalence of nutritional disorders, SAH, WC increase and presence of AN were calculated. To associate body mass index (BMI) > P85 and BP > P90 with the other variables, chi square or Fisher's exact test (significance p < 0.05) and crude and adjusted prevalence odds ratio (POR) were used. The prevalence of BMI > P85 was 22.1% [95% CI: 19.0-25.3%], of BP > P90 10.9% [95% CI: 8.6- 13.5%], increased WC 15.4% [95% CI: 12.9-17.9%] and AN 3.8% [95% CI: 2.6-5.6%].

For dialog systems, it is important to know not only what was said but also how something was communicated, so that the system can engage the user in a richer and more natural interaction. This paper addresses the problem of automatically detecting ""frustration"", ""politeness"", and ""neutral"" attitudes from a child's speech communication cues, elicited in spontaneous dialog interactions with computer characters. Several information sources such as acoustic, lexical, and contextual features, as well as, their combinations are used for this purpose. The study is based on a Wizard-of-Oz dialog corpus of 103 children, 7-14 years of age, playing a voice activated computer game. Three-way classification experiments, as well as, pairwise classification between polite vs. others and frustrated vs. others were performed. Experimental results show that lexical information has more discriminative power than acoustic and contextual cues for detection of politeness, whereas context and acoustic features perform best for frustration detection. Furthermore, the fusion of acoustic, lexical and contextual information provided significantly better classification results. Results also showed that classification performance varies with age and gender. Specifically, for the ""politeness"" detection task, higher classification accuracy was achieved for females and 10-11 years-olds, compared to males and other age groups, respectively. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955414344

Combined with economic grid model, two resource allocation mechanisms reflecting supply and demand relation are proposed from two angles of grid users and resources. The Nash equilibrium solution of users' optimal bidding and the Nash equilibrium solution of resource providers' optimal allocation share are solved respectively by using utility functions that express the objectives of two grid entities. Finally, combined with respective interests of two gamers, a joint optimal allocation policy that provides a solution of joint optimization of the objectives for both the grid user and grid resource is proposed.

For a simulator with a large number of autonomous agents, these components need to be efficient to contribute to the creation of a faster and cheaper game environment. Otherwise bottlenecks may occur and this can led to a poor representation.

Our previous work in robot ethics falls at the extreme of very simple virtual agents programmed with moral strategies for simple games (Danielson 1992). Even at this extreme, ethics is surprisingly complex. Our later evolvable agents discovered some strategies unexplored by the rational choice ethics literature (Danielson 1996; Danielson 1998; Danielson 2002). Twenty years ago, Dennett was skeptical of this branch of machine ethics: “[N]o remotely compelling system of ethics has ever been made computationally tractable, even indirectly, for real-world moral problems” (Dennett 1989, p. 129). We leave this approach to other contributors in this collection. In contrast, there is the branch of machine ethics that constructs machines to advise people making ethical decisions. Our present work falls here, or so we shall argue. We have developed an innovative survey research platform – N-Reasons – to explore robot ethics at the first level and machine ethics at the second. The question of interest for this volume is if the N-Reasons platform can be usefully seen as a machine. This contrast is interesting in another way relevant to our project. Working on Artificial Morality, the skeptical question I most often faced was, “How could a machine be moral?” The emerging technology of robotics, however, has caught up with some of this skepticism. © Cambridge University Press 2011.",,"English",Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-84927044484

How much of this is due to lifestyle choices? The objective of the study was to determine health behaviors that contribute to obesity in sixth-grade children. Methods: To assess which health habits contribute to childhood obesity, we studied body mass index, blood pressure, lipid profile, glucose, and heart rate recovery after a 3-minute step test among sixth-grade children enrolled in a school-based intervention study from 2004 to 2009, comparing health behaviors and physiologic markers in obese versus nonobese children. Univariate associations with obesity (P values ≤.10) were entered into a stepwise logistic regression to identify independent predictors. Results: Among 1,003 sixth graders (55% white, 15% African American; average age 11.5 years), 150 (15%) were obese. Obese students had higher levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, blood pressure, and recovery heart rates. They consumed more regular soda and school lunches but were less likely to engage in physical activities. Obese students were more likely to watch TV ≥2 hours per day. Independent predictors were watching TV or video games (odds ratio [OR] 1.19, 95% CI 1.06-1.33) and school lunch consumption (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.02-1.64); moderate exercise was protective (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82-0.98). Conclusions: Obesity is present in 15% of our sixth graders and is associated with major differences in cardiovascular risk factors. Opportunities to improve childhood health should emphasize programs that increase physical activity, reduce recreational screen time, and improve nutritional value of school lunches. Whether genetic or not, childhood obesity can be attacked. © 2010 Mosby, Inc.",21146676,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650078611

This paper describes research conducted with the aim of developing a system with such capabilities. The system works with standard MIDI files and develops in two stages: the first offline, the second online. In the first stage, MIDI files are partitioned in segments with uniform emotional content. These are subjected to a process of features extraction, then classified according to emotional values of valence and arousal and stored in a music base. In the second stage, segments are selected and transformed according to the desired emotion and then arranged in song-like structures. The system is using a knowledge base, grounded on empirical results of works of Music Psychology that was refined with data obtained with questionnaires; we also plan to use data obtained with other methods of emotional recognition in a near future. For the experimental setups, we prepared web-based questionnaires with musical segments of different emotional content. Each subject classified each segment after listening to it, with values for valence and arousal.

Scandinavian Journal of Psychology 51, 455-464.There is an established and growing body of evidence highlighting that music can influence behavior across a range of diverse domains (Miell, MacDonald, & Hargreaves 2005). One area of interest is the monitoring of ""internal timing mechanisms"", with features such as tempo, liking, perceived affective nature and everyday listening contexts implicated as important (North & Hargreaves, 2008). The current study addresses these issues by comparing the effects of self-selected and experimenter-selected music (fast and slow) on actual and perceived performance of a driving game activity. Seventy participants completed three laps of a driving game in seven sound conditions: (1) silence; (2) car sounds; (3) car sounds with self-selected music, and car sounds with experimenter-selected music; (4) high-arousal (70 bpm); (5) high-arousal (130 bpm); (6) low-arousal (70 bpm); and (7) low-arousal (130 bpm) music. Six performance measures (time, accuracy, speed, and retrospective perception of these), and four experience measures (perceived distraction, liking, appropriateness and enjoyment) were taken. Exposure to self-selected music resulted in overestimation of elapsed time and inaccuracy, while benefiting accuracy and experience. In contrast, exposure to experimenter-selected music resulted in poorest performance and experience. Increasing the tempo of experimenter-selected music resulted in faster performance and increased inaccuracy for high-arousal music, but did not impact experience. It is suggested that personal meaning and subjective associations connected to self-selected music promoted increased engagement with the activity, overriding detrimental effects attributed to unfamiliar, less liked and less appropriate experimenter-selected music. © 2010 The Authors.

This study explored children's and parents' perceptions of AVGs and the likely facilitators and barriers to sustained use of AVGs. Data were gathered using focus group interviews: seven with children, four with adults. Both children and parents reported that AVGs offered a way to increase activity and improve fitness. Barriers to sustained engagement, according to parents, were the cost of AVGs and lack of space in the home to play the games. According to children, the likelihood of long-term engagement with AVGs depended on game content and child age, with AVGs being seen as more appropriate for younger children than teenagers. It would appear that there is potential for AVGs to reduce inactivity in young people. However, barriers to widespread, sustainable adoption would need to be addressed if this potential is to be realized. © The Author(s) 2010.",20203134,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953661423

Adapting the learning-as-digital-game-building approach, this paper explores how new educational practices can help students build skills for the 21st century. Purpose: This paper examines elementary students' learning experiences through digital game building and playing. The following research questions guided the study: (1) What emotions do students experience during the process of building digital games for others to use?; (2) What traits do students display when they learn through digital game-building?; and (3) What do students learn from the digital game-building experience? Sample: The participants were 21 elementary students (19 boys and two girls), aged between seven and 11, who were on a summer camp at a university in Canada. Design and methods: This small-scale study made use of enactivism (Li, Clark, and Winchester, Instructional design and technology grounded in enactivism: A paradigm shift?, British Journal of Educational Technology 41, no. 3: 403-419, 2010), a new theoretical framework, as a basis for analysing the students' experiences and responses as they created computer games to teach others the concept of Issac Newton's Three Laws of Motion. Quantitative and qualitative data collected included student and parent surveys, teacher and student interviews, field observations and the digital games created by the students. Data were subjected to quantitative and thematic analyses. Results: The results indicated that only a small minority of students reported never feeling the positive emotions excited/happy or smart/proud during the process of building digital games. In addition, analysis suggested that creativity, engagement and new identity were the three salient traits displayed by the students when learning by digital game-building. There was also evidence that students increased their understanding of the subject matter in question (mathematics, science and technology) and enhanced their general problem-solving abilities through the process. Conclusions: This small-scale study suggests that student engagement in the game-building experience can enhance not just the learning of the game design process but also subject matter and generic skills. Thus, the learning-as-building approach can empower students to 'take over the technology' and become creators rather than passive consumers. © 2010 NFER.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-78149433215

To understand the aesthetic impact of game sound on player experience, definitions of emotions are briefly discussed and framed in the game context. This leads to an introduction of empirical methods for assessing physiological and psychological effects of play, such as the affective impact of sonic playergame interaction. The psychological methodology presented is largely based on subjective interpretation of experience, while psychophysiological methodology is based on measurable bodily changes, such as context-dependent, physiological experience. As a means to illustrate both the potential and the difficulties inherent in such methodology we discuss the results of some experiments that investigate game sound and music effects and, finally, we close with a discussion of possible research directions based on a speculative assessment of the future of player-game interaction through affective sound. © 2011, IGI Global.",,"English",Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-84900222199

This makes computer technology ideal for educational applications, as intrinsic motivation for learning is built into the game. Considering that nowadays most children spend quite a bit of their waking hours in front of a computer, it is clearly desirable to make computer games as educational as possible. These considerations hold generally true for children with typical development as well as for children with developmental disabilities or with mental impairments. There is quite a long history of the use of computers in educational settings, including special education, but the explosive growth of rapidly evolving computer technology plus recent findings from research in education and in developmental disabilities make computers an ever more promising, appropriate, and powerful tool in any learning environment today. Modern educational computer games have several immense advantages: Considering that most families have access to a computer, these games are inexpensive, widely distributable, and easily accessible for most families, largely independent of economic status (i.e., ""democratization of learning opportunities""). They may reduce the need for costly one-on-one professional tutoring. These games can be designed to be fun and dynamic. Perhaps most importantly, computer games can be custom-designed to adjust in ""real time"" and ""on-line"" to the player's individual characteristics, whether those are strengths or weaknesses. Most recently, we designed a simple computer game that can be enjoyed and played successfully by low-functioning children with autism and has been shown to be useful in assessing the child's individual attention patterns in language perception. The game is also designed such that in the future attention to general visual and auditory information can be assessed. With this approach, for example, synchronicity of facial expression and emotional tone in language can be assessed. Perception of both language and emotions are known to be problematic for many children with autism. Future development aims at building in features that allow the computer to monitor the child's individual attention patterns, adjust to them, and then implement attentionshaping methods to remediate any deficits. A general application will be to help focus and expand the attention span of children with autism and with attention deficit disorder. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

These two goals often are at odds, since well controlled stimuli often are too repetitive to sustain subjects' motivation. Studies employing electroencephalography (EEG) are often especially sensitive to this dilemma between ecological validity and experimental control: attaining sufficient signal-to-noise in physiological averages demands large numbers of repeated trials within lengthy recording sessions, limiting the subject pool to individuals with the ability and patience to perform a set task over and over again. This constraint severely limits researchers' ability to investigate younger populations as well as clinical populations associated with heightened anxiety or attentional abnormalities. Even adult, non-clinical subjects may not be able to achieve their typical levels of performance or cognitive engagement: an unmotivated subject for whom an experimental task is little more than a chore is not the same, behaviourally, cognitively, or neurally, as a subject who is intrinsically motivated and engaged with the task. A growing body of literature demonstrates that embedding experiments within video games may provide a way between the horns of this dilemma between experimental control and ecological validity. The narrative of a game provides a more realistic context in which tasks occur, enhancing their ecological validity (Chaytor & Schmitter-Edgecombe, 2003). Moreover, this context provides motivation to complete tasks. In our game, subjects perform various missions to collect resources, fend off pirates, intercept communications or facilitate diplomatic relations. In so doing, they also perform an array of cognitive tasks, including a Posner attention-shifting paradigm (Posner, 1980), a go/no-go test of motor inhibition, a psychophysical motion coherence threshold task, the Embedded Figures Test (Witkin, 1950, 1954) and a theory-of-mind (Wimmer & Perner, 1983) task. The game software automatically registers game stimuli and subjects' actions and responses in a log file, and sends event codes to synchronise with physiological data recorders. Thus the game can be combined with physiological measures such as EEG or fMRI, and with moment-to-moment tracking of gaze. Gaze tracking can verify subjects' compliance with behavioural tasks (e.g. fixation) and overt attention to experimental stimuli, and also physiological arousal as reflected in pupil dilation (Bradley et al., 2008). At great enough sampling frequencies, gaze tracking may also help assess covert attention as reflected in microsaccades - eye movements that are too small to foveate a new object, but are as rapid in onset and have the same relationship between angular distance and peak velocity as do saccades that traverse greater distances. The distribution of directions of microsaccades correlates with the (otherwise) covert direction of attention (Hafed & Clark, 2002).",21206465,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84873027916

Four perspectives on emotions are described: Darwinian, James-Lange, cognitive, and social constructivist. Three basic properties of diegetic sound effects were studied: volume, timing, and source. Results strongly suggest that the best sound design for causing fear is high volume and timed sound effects (synchronized game sound with visual moment) and somewhat suggest that sourced sound effects also promote fear. For anxiety, results strongly suggest that the best sound design is medium volume sound effects. Results also suggest that acousmatic and untimed sound effects evoke suspense rather than anxiety.

These two goals often are at odds, since well controlled stimuli often are too repetitive to sustain subjects' motivation. Studies employing electroencephalography (EEG) are often especially sensitive to this dilemma between ecological validity and experimental control: attaining sufficient signal-to-noise in physiological averages demands large numbers of repeated trials within lengthy recording sessions, limiting the subject pool to individuals with the ability and patience to perform a set task over and over again. This constraint severely limits researchers' ability to investigate younger populations as well as clinical populations associated with heightened anxiety or attentional abnormalities. Even adult, non-clinical subjects may not be able to achieve their typical levels of performance or cognitive engagement: an unmotivated subject for whom an experimental task is little more than a chore is not the same, behaviourally, cognitively, or neurally, as a subject who is intrinsically motivated and engaged with the task. A growing body of literature demonstrates that embedding experiments within video games may provide a way between the horns of this dilemma between experimental control and ecological validity. The narrative of a game provides a more realistic context in which tasks occur, enhancing their ecological validity (Chaytor & Schmitter-Edgecombe, 2003). Moreover, this context provides motivation to complete tasks. In our game, subjects perform various missions to collect resources, fend off pirates, intercept communications or facilitate diplomatic relations. In so doing, they also perform an array of cognitive tasks, including a Posner attention-shifting paradigm (Posner, 1980), a go/no-go test of motor inhibition, a psychophysical motion coherence threshold task, the Embedded Figures Test (Witkin, 1950, 1954) and a theory-of-mind (Wimmer & Perner, 1983) task. The game software automatically registers game stimuli and subjects' actions and responses in a log file, and sends event codes to synchronise with physiological data recorders. Thus the game can be combined with physiological measures such as EEG or fMRI, and with moment-to-moment tracking of gaze. Gaze tracking can verify subjects' compliance with behavioural tasks (e.g. fixation) and overt attention to experimental stimuli, and also physiological arousal as reflected in pupil dilation (Bradley et al., 2008). At great enough sampling frequencies, gaze tracking may also help assess covert attention as reflected in microsaccades - eye movements that are too small to foveate a new object, but are as rapid in onset and have the same relationship between angular distance and peak velocity as do saccades that traverse greater distances. The distribution of directions of microsaccades correlates with the (otherwise) covert direction of attention (Hafed & Clark, 2002). © JoVE 2006-2011.

The MIROSOT league soccer game concept is fairly simple: two teams of robots, with 3-5 robots per side, play football autonomously. The ball that the teams play with is an orange golf ball. Above the pitch is a machine vision camera running at 60 frames per second. This camera is linked to a server, which calculates the positions and velocities of each of the robots and the ball, and then determines what each robot should be doing. These instructions are then communicated to the robots over wireless links. In order to develop an efficient control strategy and architecture, the robots have to use strategies from the real human soccer game. Using the software Simi Scout, a suitable analysis of tactics can be extracted from the games. After analyzing the soccer game, a number of attributes are specified and then embedded at different levels. The specified attributes are interconnected, and the analysis of the game is processed for optimization. Using this information, the robot program is adapted and experimental tests/games are played.

Midway through the trip, Holohan notes, her six-year-old daughter looked out her window and noticed a ""rectangular box of light fl oating in mid-air, fl ashes of color darting across its surface-foreign yet familiar.""1 After observing that the television in the passing car ""looked like magic, "" the child and her mother began playing a game of ""How many TVs can we fi nd in cars?"" Later, as her daughter fell asleep, Holohan found herself with a growing sense of anxiety as she thought about the presence of portable televisions and DVD players in automobiles. It was not the threat to physical safety that primarily concerned Holohan-although she does mention the ""sacred reverence"" we each should have while driving-but rather the threat it represented to her family's (and other families') social dynamics. After recalling the road trips she had taken as a child with her father, Holohan observed that only in the ""sacred space"" of the car's interior had she ever felt able to ask her father life's ""big questions."" In effect, Holohan mused, not only would such mobile media make ubiquitous what should be dosed out in small portions, but they would ultimately lead to the disappearance of a sublime arena for family interaction and ""informal education."" Holohan warns us that driving should never be equated with sitting on the living room couch as even a drive through the neighborhood provides ""an opportunity to glimpse our environment outside of ourselves, to refl ect on an experience that is uniquely human.""2 The space of mobility is here an arena worthy of argument. Holohan's essay, to the degree that it is an example of a genre of refl ections on the value and use of portable DVD players-especially as used in cars-is signifi cant in a number of ways. First, on perhaps the most basic level, the article is a representative anecdote of the general cultural anxiety that consistently accompanies the growing use of any new medium (or new use of an existing medium). As Douglas Thomas and Marita Sturken put it, new communication technologies and new uses of existing technologies have been historically accompanied by both utopian claims concerning how they will improve our shared human condition and dystopian fears ""that actual human connection has been irretrievably lost.""3 More signifi cantly, however, and I will pursue this concern throughout the chapter, Holohan's comments represent one side of a public debate over media use that ultimately concerns the contours of what Toby Miller has referred to as the ""well-tempered self, "" that manageable, cultural subject formed and governed through institutions and discourses.4 Given that the automobile and information technologies complicate the meanings of public and private (rather than having a solely destructive infl uence), as Mimi Sheller and John Urry point out in the opening epigraph, public debates over these technologies are, in effect, also arguments over what it means to be ""in public"" and how one is to behave publicly. As they are arguments, the meaning, indeed, changes over time. While television since its inception has been understood as a technology through which individuals come to understand ideological norms and disciplinary images, automobiles-because of the ways they are regulated and disciplined by government rules, institutions, and public discourse-are also implicated in webs of ideological meaning. Hence, both television monitors and automobiles simultaneously act as individualizing prosthetics and purveyors of ideological norms and the regulations of govern-mentality. As a result, the public discussion over the costs/benefi ts of their joint usage should tell us something about contemporary values and norms of citizenship. The link between technologies of mobility and communication quite rightly has taken center stage in many contemporary critical projects.5 As Jeremy Packer puts it, the discourse surrounding mobility and the safety of mobile subjects ultimately concerns the safety, security, and good health of the citizen: ""How we conduct ourselves as mobile subjects and how we construct mobilizations is related to how we enable ourselves as citizens, neighbors, and intellectuals.""6 For instance, in a reading of mass mediated representations of the introduction of the Segway, James Hay and Packer think through the ways ""communication and transportation have been and are being conjugated and linked"" and discussed in political terms of freedom and governance.7 In general, technologies of physical movement and technologies of communication/information movement (e.g., CB radios, cell phones) are discussed both in terms of individual ""freedom"" and in terms of public safety/public responsibility. Packer and Hay moreover suggest that investigations of ""the portability of media and communication technologies"" and ""the material attachment of these technologies to technologies of transport"" are linked to discussions of what matters to a culture in terms of the well-behaved citizen.8 Citizenship is not ""dead"" or in decline; the public is not dead; however, our understanding of each and their interconnections have been altered by public/private modalities. Perhaps we could speak, then, of ""modalities of citizenship"" rather than citizenship itself. Given the multiple ties between the cultural understandings of our means of physical mobility (e.g., the way automobiles are understood ideologically and culturally) and metaphoric mobility (e.g., the ways media may be seen as ""extensions of humanity"" in space and time), the public discourse surrounding the use of television/DVD players within cars leads to discussions about the appropriate behavior of citizens in general. Moreover, given the large degree to which portable and mobile DVD players are utilized by children-highly regulated and protected citizens-it is also the case that the discourse surrounding the use of television/DVD players in cars tells us something about our contemporary expectations of, or battles over, proper child rearing. In effect, by investigating the discourse surrounding portable DVD players in cars, I provide a critical snapshot of our understanding of the appropriate ways in which citizens and budding citizens are expected to employ these particular mediated ""prosthetic"" devices as well as the ways these prosthetics are seen as shaping their ""users."" In the spirit of the introduction (by Daniel Brouwer and Robert Asen) to this volume, I want to stress that this snapshot is a framing of the values expected of citizens and their behavior. Moreover, the valence of these values is a mixed bag, encouraging the critic (here, me) to provide a reading that works according to my own concerns about how a collective people should behave. © 2010 by The University of Alabama Press.

The show takes place in a New Mexico ghost town called Bonanza City, where one can just imagine Lorne Green or Michael Landon lurking somewhere offscreen. The children are charged with creating this new world on their own, a heavy responsibility for a cast ranging in age from eight to fifteen. Aside from the obvious biblical reference to Noah and the Flood, the show offers visual nostalgia for the grand ol' days of a shoot-'em-up Wild West that must be tamed (minus, of course, outlaws or hostile Native Americans). According to Jyotsna Kapur, ""Children are invoked as mediums through which the past [glory and power] can be restored"" (87), and Kid Nation functions as a modern fusion of such ideological themes as civilization versus nature, individual strength against great odds, the glory of the Western frontier, and the innocence of childhood. The series alludes to such cultural artifacts as William Goldings's Lord of the Flies and John Ford westerns. The tagline on the Web site continues, ""Will they come together as a cohesive unit or will they succumb to the childhood temptations that lead to chaos?"" This question challenges broad cultural fantasies of an imagined Victorian-style childhood innocence. In our postmodern society, childhood is increasingly conceived of in nostalgic terms that infuse it with a desire for a ""perfect"" past that has not yet been created. In reality, the postmodern child's material and geographic condition is an increasingly multitextual space: urban, wired, materialist, graphic, and more adultlike; here nostalgia for a ""lost"" childhood works alongside a youth's desire for adult autonomy. Reinforcing that quest for an idealized childhood are the growing communities of ""cyber-real"" space (computer and video games, online communities, text messaging, Facebook, YouTube, and so on), which offer the promise of multiple satisfactions. The image of childhood, as commonly conceived, is being transformed as a result of the constant infusion of technology into daily life. Childhood has become ""staged for public consumption"" (Postman 82-83) to fit a nostalgic ideal of what childhood should be. Kid Nation is one, perhaps inevitable, move toward uniting the reality show with the adult quest for youth in this era of an increasing loss of ""childness."" As Postman argues, broad access to the information superhighway has allowed for a certain level of knowledge now available to children that, in an earlier time, would have been exclusive to adults (85). The line between adult and child in Kid Nation is blurred; it is situated between children's desire to be adult (adultifying) and adult desire to recapture youth. The series attempts to offer a fantasy to both groups. The reality show experience changes the discourse of childhood as a socially negotiated space by authenticating existing social structures in the series' myth of creating a brave new world. The series sets up the typical conflict dynamic between participants expected from a reality show within the coming-of-age frame. This site of mediation between childhood and adulthood in Kid Nation, as a display, requires a reexamination of common assumptions about what it means to be a child in the digital age. The sociopolitical structures implemented in Kid Nation severely restrict the children's ability to actually create the new society that the series promises; instead, childhood is displayed as a condition that must be overcome in the quest for increased productivity in Bonanza City. Kid Nation commodifies childhood and then systematically destroys it. In a paradoxical move, the rhetoric of recaptured youth (free from adults) instead offers the visual and emotional destruction of childhood while the viewer commiserates with the young people trapped within adult social matrices, much like rats in a maze: how will the children negotiate the assigned challenges of money, class, race, religion, prejudice - and their own state of childhood?.

The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between pre-pregnancy cardiovascular reactivity to stress and pregnancy outcome. The sample included 917 women in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study who had cardiovascular reactivity measured in 1987-88 and at least one subsequent singleton livebirth within an 18-year period. Cardiovascular reactivity was measured using a video game, star tracing and cold pressor test. Gestational age and birthweight were based on the women's self-report, with PTB defined as birth <37 weeks' gestation and SGA as weight <10th percentile for gestational age. Linear and Poisson regression and generalised estimating equations were used to model the relationship between reactivity to stress and birth outcomes with control for confounders. Few associations were seen between reactivity and pregnancy outcomes. Higher pre-pregnancy diastolic blood pressure (adjusted relative risk 1.14; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.98, 1.34) and mean arterial pressure reactivity (1.15; 0.98, 1.36) were associated with risk of PTB at first pregnancy, while SGA was associated with lower systolic blood pressure reactivity (0.76; 0.60, 0.95). No associations were seen with other measures of reactivity. Contrary to hypothesis, the association between heart rate reactivity and PTB in first pregnancy was stronger in whites (adjusted relative risk 1.39; 1.03, 1.88) than in blacks (1.00; 0.83, 1.20; P for interaction=0.08). Similar results were found for mean arterial pressure.

The 'off-side' game permitted players to have 3 'plays' while in possession of the ball. Players were permitted to pass backward or forward (to an 'off-side' player). The 'on-side' game also permitted players to have 3 'plays' while in possession of the ball. However, players were only permitted to pass backward to players in an 'on-side' position. Heart rate and movement patterns (via global positioning system) were recorded continuously throughout both games. Data were collected on the distance covered, number of high-acceleration and velocity efforts, and recovery between efforts. Video footage was also taken to track the performance of the players. Post hoc inspection of the footage was undertaken to count the number of possessions and the number and quality of disposals.

Using data provided by 388 players of a massively multiplayer online role playing game (MMORPG) via an online questionnaire, psychometric measures of engagement and addiction to the MMORPG taking into account the distinction between core and peripheral addiction criteria are shown to be differentially related to personality factors (extraversion, emotional stability, agreeableness, negative valence, and attractiveness). Addiction scale scores are shown to increase as negativity on all five personality characteristics increases, with these characteristics predicting 20% of the variance in addiction scores, but the same pattern is shown to occur for only one characteristic (negative valence) for the engagement scale, with personality characteristics predicting only around 2% of the variance in engagement scores. It is concluded that there is reasonable support for the distinctions between addiction and engagement and between core and peripheral criteria.

The present study examined the emotional and neural correlates of upward social comparison (comparison with those who have more) and downward social comparison (comparison with those who have less). Two experiments were conducted with volunteers in an interactive game of chance, in which a putative player won or lost more money than the participant. The results showed that even when participants lost money, they expressed joy and schadenfreude (gloating) if the other player had lost more money. On the other hand when they actually won money, but the other player had won more they expressed envy. This pattern was also demonstrated in a differential BOLD response in the ventral striatum. Comparing the activations between an actual gain and a relative gain indicated that even when a person loses money, merely adding information about another person's greater loss may increase ventral striatum activations to a point where these activations are similar to those of an actual gain. We suggest that the ventral striatum plays a role in mediating the emotional consequences of social comparison. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",20205244,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-78649543298

Resources management is one of the important problems facing most Internet Service Providers (ISPs). As a solution, the Autonomic Service Architecture (ASA) is proposed in the literature to automate the resources management. Although, this model is able to improve ISPs' performance by automatically adjusting the resources allocation of each customer, it still suffers from two main limitations. First, this model increases the ISPs' revenue in a suboptimal way. Second, this model has no mechanism to prevent customers' exaggeration that can lead to a non-efficient resource utilization, and violate the contracted Service Level Agreements' (SLAs) terms. To guarantee their QoS classes; customers might exaggerate by asking for more resources during and after the SLA negotiation session, especially in the case of multimedia streaming, and this can waste the available network resources. To overcome the above limitations, we propose an Autonomic Resources Management Mechanism (ARMM) that increases the ISPs' revenue by allocating resources based on the auction mechanism, where resources are granted to the best bidders. Additionally, we propose a threat model based on Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism that is able to penalize exaggerating bidders according to the created inconvenience. Since in our framework, customers are assumed to be rational, they will avoid asking for more unneeded resources but they can collude with others to have the resources for less. Such a behavior can dramatically minimize the ISP revenue while on the other hand it can maximize the customers' utility. To avoid this, we propose a collusion resistant model based on the Markov Decision Process (MDP) that allows the ISP to calculate the state-dependent optimal cost-unit threshold based on the shadow price concept. All bids that are greater than or equal this threshold are considered in the auction. With this threshold, we can reduce the collusion behavior and with VCG we can motivate the customers to not exaggerate. Simulation results show that the ARMM model is able to efficiently utilize network resources, increase ISPs' profit, and customers' satisfaction rates. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

When they spin and fail to gain any credits, the machine goes into a state of relative quiet. By contrast, when they spin and win, these spins are accompanied by reinforcing sights and sounds. Such reinforcement also occurs when the amount won is less than the spin wager. We sought to show that these 'losses disguised as wins', or LDWs, would be as arousing as wins, and more arousing than regular losses. Measurement and participants: We measured skin conductance response (SCR) amplitudes and heart-rate changes following wins, LDWs and losses for 40 novices playing a multi-line slot machine. Findings: SCR amplitudes were similar for wins and LDWs - both were significantly larger than for regular losses. Conclusions: For novice players, the reinforcing sights and sounds of the slot machine triggered arousal on wins, where the number of credits gained was greater than the spin wager, but also on 'losses disguised as wins' where the amount 'won' was less than the spin wager. Despite the fact that players lost money on these spins, these outcomes were more arousing than regular losses where no credits were gained. Although these findings involve novice players, the heightened arousal associated with these losses may have implications for the development of problem gambling, as arousal has been viewed as a key reinforcer in gambling behaviour. © 2010 Society for the Study of Addiction.",20712818,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956789047

Several studies have provided evidence of the usefulness of physiological signals for affective gaming; however, due to the limited knowledge about the distinctive autonomic signatures for every emotion, the pattern matching models employed are limited in the number of emotions they are able to classify. This paper presents a bio-affective gaming interface (BAGI) that can be used to customize a game experience according to the player's emotional response. Its architecture offers important characteristics for gaming that are important because they make possible the reusability of previous findings and the inclusion of new models to the system. In order to prove the effectiveness of BAGI, two different types of neural networks have been trained to recognize emotions. They were incorporated into the system to customize, in real-time, the computer wallpaper according to the emotion experienced by the user. Best results were obtained with a probabilistic neural network with accuracy results of 84.46% on the training data and 78.38% on the validation for new independent data sets.

The analysis shows that, due to the dramaturgic structure of handball transmissions, viewers consider such transmissions particularly reliable and effective sources of entertainment. The transmissions' entertainment value derives from their specific ability to give the viewers a complex experience of feeling autonomous and competent when mastering the game and in relation to others. The study shows that entertainment concerns both affective involvement and identity formation, as social and cultural meaning seem to be at the root of involvement. Even though both men and women find great joy in the transmissions, their viewing is embedded in quite diverse patterns regarding additional media use.

We advocate that the topic is particularly suitable for teaching in different levels. First, the occurring problems are part of current mathematical research with still open problems. This could motivate our talented students for active autonomous problem solving and bring the groups of researchers, educators and students closer. The presented computer supported tools enable an emphasis shift from the frontal teaching to project based, self-paced or active small group learning. By manipulating the size of the grid, the water level, or the height of a cell with suitable graphical interface elements, the learner becomes an active part of the discovery and learning process. The introduced graphical representations can be studied dynamically and parallel with the interactive demonstrations and games designed by the authors. The concrete representations, and constructions can facilitate the discovery of patterns and can lead to invention of general conjectures. In fact, the authors of the paper ourselves found some results in 4.1-2.4 in this way. We computed values for several small fixed sized grids, detected patterns for establishing a recursion and finally resolved them. For the investigation of integer sequences there are built-in functions in computer algebra systems like Mathematica, or there is a web resource, an online encyclopedia for looking up interesting integer sequences by just knowing their first few entries (http://www.research.att.com/~njas/ sequences/). The experimental activity complements, but does not replace, the essential part of the mathematical activity: the rigorous theorem proving. For doing so, we used some elementary results from the theory of linear recurrences and graphs and applied induction and the method of two-sided estimation. We deduced the maximal number of islands in the rectangular grid with the latter techniques. We note that we are going to use the Theorema proving system (Windsteiger et al. 2006) for supporting the formulation of the predicates and functions of the island theory in a more formal language and for facilitating the computation and proving phase of the exploration with computers. It is noted that even if the obtained lower and upper bounds would have been different, the efforts for establishing those bounds are not in vain and there is no a priori guarantee that the exact solution has a nice closed form. In fact, if the number of triangular islands in a grid with size n is denoted by f(n), according to Horváth et al. (2009), it is ""only"" known that n2+3n 5 ≤ f (n) ≤ n2+9n+2 14 . The grid and cell model we have considered can also be a link between different disciplines. There are other examples requiring only m 9 n cells on a rectangular grid; for example, aij may mean a colour on a gray-scale (before we convert the picture to black and white), transparency (against X-rays), or melting temperature. The technique of gradual increase of the water level is applied successfully in medical image processing (Beucher and Lantuejoul 1979). This outlook may also motivate our students to consider mathematics not as an abstract sterile world, but rather as the general technique of systematic problem solving with real applications. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952618294

Additionally, we report the results of a correlation between GEQ dimensions and EMG/EDA activity. We conclude subjective measures could advance our understanding of sonic UX in digital games, while affective tonic (i.e., long-term psychophysiological) measures of sonic UX in digital games did not yield statistically significant results. One approach for future affective psychophysiological measures of sonic UX could be experiments investigating phasic (i.e., event-related) psychophysiological measures of sonic gameplay elements in digital games. This could improve our general understanding of sonic UX beyond affective gaming evaluation. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955424714

Heart rate, preejection period, total peripheral resistance, and blood pressure reactivity were measured during cold and psychological stress. The Arg389Gly polymorphism in the β1-AR was associated with preejection period reactivity in males but not in females.

Episodic basal secretion of these hormones may modify the responsiveness of these hormones. We sought to identify episodic steroid secretion via frequent salivary sampling and investigate any interaction between ultradian rhythmicity and induced changes in testosterone. Salivary testosterone and cortisol concentrations of seven males (age 20-40 years) were measured every 10 min between 0800 and1600 h on three consecutive days. On either the second or third day, three interventions designed to elicit a hormonal response were randomly assigned: sprint exercise (two 30-s maximal efforts on a cycle ergometer); boxing (two 30-s maximal punching efforts); and a violent video game (10 min of player vs. player combat). On the other days subjects were inactive. Testosterone data on non-intervention days suggested pulsatile secretion with a pulse interval of 47 ± 9 min (mean ± SD). The sprint intervention substantially affected hormones: it elicited a small transient elevation in testosterone (by a factor of 1.21; factor 90% confidence limits ×/÷1.21) 10 min after exercise, and a moderate elevation in cortisol peaking 50 min post-exercise (factor 2.3; ×/÷2.6). The testosterone response correlated with the change in testosterone concentration in the 10 min prior to the sprint (r = 0.78; 90% CL 0.22-0.95) and with a measure of randomness in testosterone fluctuations (r = 0.83; 0.35-0.96). Thus, the salivary testosterone response to exercise may be dependent on the underlying ultradian rhythm and aspects of its regulation. This interaction may have important implications for adaptation to exercise. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",20512500,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956619081

Twenty-nine implanted children and 68 children with normal-hearing performed frequency discrimination studies at varying frequencies. Electrode discrimination was assessed in thirty-four implanted children at varying electrode locations and stimulation intensities. Older children had better frequency discrimination than younger children, both for implanted and hearing subjects. Implanted children had worse frequency discrimination overall and exhibited learning effects at older ages than hearing children. Frequency discrimination Weber fractions were smallest in low frequencies. Electrode discrimination improved with stimulus intensity level for older but not younger children at all electrode locations. These results support the premise that developmental changes in signal processing contribute to discrimination of simple acoustic stimuli.

Occupational therapists and physiotherapists in a rehabilitation hospital trialed four Wii games that addressed physical movement, balance, coordination, and cognitive performance. Then, they completed an opinion survey on the utility of Wii in rehabilitation. The results were compared between burn care therapists (BTs) and nonburn care therapists, using χ with a P < .05 considered significant.

The model assumes movement is by diffusion and that growth is logistic. This logistic growth is dependent on an historical population, in contrast to Fisher's equation which bases it on the present population. The model therefore takes into account the fact that new additions to the adult fly population are, in actual fact, the descendents of a population which existed one puparial duration ago, furthermore, that this puparial duration is temperature dependent. Artificially imposed mortality is modelled as a proportion at a constant rate. Fisher's equation is also solved as a formality.The temporary imposition of a 2% day-1 mortality everywhere outside the reserve for a period of 2years will have no lasting effect on the influence of the reserve on either the Glossina austeni or the G. brevipalpis populations, although it certainly will eradicate tsetse from poor habitat, outside the reserve. A 5km-wide barrier with a minimum mortality of 4% day-1, throughout, will succeed in isolating a worst-case, G. austeni population and its associated trypanosomiasis from the surrounding areas. A more optimistic estimate of its mobility suggests a mortality of 2% day-1 will suffice.

A typical use case is load balancing which aims at increasing the overall network capacity in case of unequal traffic distribution. The 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) standard provides the means that enables the handover of users from highly loaded cells to the lower loaded neighbors. The method is based on exchanging load Information between neighboring cells. However, the computation of the amount of load that a cell should either offload or accept is running autonomously in each cell and is most likely not generally specified, but rather vendor specific. In this case, a network-wide algorithm for load balancing may not be possible to use if eNodeBs from distinct vendors are deployed. In this game-theoretic analysis for load balancing, we consider each cell as a rational player that decides, in the worst-case, on the amount of load that maximizes its payoff in an uncooperative way. The simulation results for LTE network show that the resulting Nash equilibrium is able to achieve most of the gain expected from a strictly cooperative load balancing scheme. Though each cell acts independently, the Nash equilibrium almost provides the same performance of a network-wide algorithm for load balancing which would ease the players to decide on strategies that are more collaborative. The capacity gain of the Nash equilibrium is verified for the homogeneous network layout, different scenarios and parameter configurations. Moreover, to take real network effects, such as different cell sizes and number of neighbor cells Into consideration, the Nash equilibrium is also tested in the heterogeneous network layout.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-79951836895

Besides the direct effects of the muscular dystrophy, the increasing effort to perform activities, the fear of falling and the use of personal aids indirectly impair leg and arm functions as a result of disuse. Physical training could oppose this secondary physical deterioration. The No Use is Disuse (NUD) study is the first study in human subjects with DMD that will examine whether a low-intensity physical training is beneficial in terms of preservation of muscle endurance and functional abilities. The study consists of two training intervention studies: study 1 ""Dynamic leg and arm training for ambulant and recently wheelchair-dependent boys with DMD and, study 2 ""Functional training with arm support for boys with DMD who have been confined to a wheelchair for several years"". This paper describes the hypotheses and methods of the NUD study.Methods: Study 1 is an explorative randomized controlled trial with multiple baseline measurements. Thirty boys with a DNA-established diagnosis of DMD will be included. The intervention consists of a six-months physical training during which boys train their legs and arms with active and/or assisted cycling training equipment. The primary study outcomes are muscle endurance and functional abilities, assessed with a Six-Minute Bicycle Test and the Motor Function Measure. Study 2 has a within-group repeated measurements design and will include ten boys with DMD who have already been confined to a wheelchair for several years. The six-months physical training program consists of 1) a computer-assisted training and 2) a functional training with an arm support. The primary study outcome is functional abilities of the upper extremity, assessed with the Action Research Arm Test.Discussion: The NUD study will fill part of the gap in the current knowledge about the possible effects of training in boys with DMD and will increase insight into what type of exercise should be recommended to boys with DMD. The study will finish at the end of 2010 and results are expected in 2011.Trial registration: The Netherlands National Trial Register1631. © 2010 Jansen et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",20691042,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955224267

We utilize cooperative game theory as a tool to devise a distributed dynamic coalition formation algorithm in which nodes autonomously decide which coalition to join while maximizing their feasible sleep times. Nodes in the sleep mode do not record any measurements, hence, save energy in both sensing and transmitting the sensed data. It is proved that if each node operates according to this algorithm, the average sleep time for the entire network converges to its maximum feasible value. In numerical examples, we illustrate the tradeoff between localization accuracy and the average sleep time allocated to the nodes and demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed scheme via Monte Carlo simulations. © 2010 IEEE.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954598915

Male subjects (n = 32) were randomly and equally divided into either an experimental (EXP) or control (CON) group. Acute exercise responses (V̇O2, heart rate, and RPE) were measured in all subjects during both soloand opponent-based video game play. Subjects in the EXP group played using a controller that relied on full-body isometric muscle resistance to manipulate the on-screen character, whereas CON subjects used a conventional handheld controller.

To tackle this problem we present in this paper an ant colony algorithm for path finding that takes into account the emotions of the game characters and we show how our approach is used in an augmented-reality educational game. The proposed algorithm is implemented on a GPU processor to demonstrate its scalability with large problem sizes when compared to its corresponding CPU version. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

To assess physical activity levels during active video game play over time and compare this to 'free play' associated with recess activity in a sample of British primary school children over a 6-week period. Basic procedures. Thirty children (ages 10-11, 12 boys, 18 girls) from central England were randomly selected to participate in a 6 week, recess based, active video gaming intervention (n = 15) or act as controls (n = 15). Repeated measures analysis of covariance (controlling for body fatness) was used to examine any differences in physical activity, determined by pedometry and heart rate monitoring over time and between intervention and control groups. Main Findings. Children in the intervention accumulated significantly greater steps/day than the control group during the first week of the intervention. This pattern was reversed at the mid and end points of the intervention (p = .03). Irrespective of time point, children engaging in active video game play spent a lesser percentage of time engaged in MVPA than the controls undertaking 'traditional' recess activity (p = .0001). Conclusions. Active video game play does not appear to be a sustainable means to enhance children's physical activity. Although physical activity (steps/min) was greater on initial presentation of active video games compared to 'traditional' recess activity, this appears to be an acute effect.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955235907

Rooted in self-determination theory (Deci & Ryan, 2000; Ryan & Deci, 2000a), our approach suggests that both the appeal and well-being effects of video games are based in their potential to satisfy basic psychological needs for competence, autonomy, and relatedness. We review recent empirical evidence applying this perspective to a number of topics including need satisfaction in games and short-term well-being, the motivational appeal of violent game content, motivational sources of postplay aggression, the antecedents and consequences of disordered patterns of game engagement, and the determinants and effects of immersion.

Individual differences in work stress appraisal and psychobiological cost of prolonged load seem to be of importance in view of expanding compressed working time schedules. Twenty-one healthy, male volunteers (mean±SD: 27.9±4.9 yrs) were required to stay in semiconstant routine conditions. They performed four sessions (each lasting ∼2.5h) of simulated driving, i.e., completed chosen tasks from computer driving games. Saliva samples were collected after each driving session, i.e., at 10:0011:00, 14:0015:00, 18:0019:00, and 22:0023:00h as well as 1030min after waking (between 05:00 and 06:00h) and at bedtime (after 00:00h). Two subgroups of subjects were distinguished on the basis of the Chronotype Questionnaire: morning (M)- and evening (E)-oriented types. Subjective data on sleep need, sleeping time preferences, sleeping problems, and the details of the preceding night were investigated by questionnaire. Subjective measures of task load (NASA Task Load Index [NASA-TLX]), activation (Thayer's Activation-Deactivation Adjective Check List [AD ACL]), and sleepiness (Karolinska Sleepiness Scale [KSS]) were applied at times of saliva samples collection. M- and E-oriented types differed significantly as to their ideal sleep length (6 h 54 min±44 versus 8 h 13 min±50 min), preferred sleep timing (midpoint at 03:19 versus 04:26), and sleep index, i.e., 'real-to-ideal' sleep ratio, before the experimental day (0.88 versus 0.67). Sleep deficit proved to be integrated with eveningness. M and E types exhibited similar diurnal profiles of energy, tiredness, tension, and calmness assessed by AD ACL, but E types estimated higher their workload (NASA-TLX) and sleepiness (KSS). M types exhibited a trend of higher mean cortisol levels than E types (F4.192, p<.056) and distinct diurnal variation (F2.950, p<.019), whereas E types showed a flattened diurnal curve. Cortisol values did not correlate with subjective assessments of workload, arousal, or sleepiness at any time-of-day. Diurnal cortisol pattern parameters (i.e., morning level, mean level, and range of diurnal changes) showed significant positive correlations with sleep length before the experiment (r.48, .54, and .53, respectively) and with sleep index (r.63, .64, and .56, respectively). The conclusions of this study are: (i) E-oriented types showed lower salivary cortisol levels and a flattened diurnal curve in comparison with M types; (ii) sleep loss was associated with lower morning cortisol and mean diurnal level, whereas higher cortisol levels were observed in rested individuals. In the context of stress theory, it may be hypothesized that rested subjects perceived the driving task as a challenge, whereas those with reduced sleep were not challenged, but boredexhausted with the experimental situation. copyright © 2010 Informa UK Ltd.",20636209,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954847841

An efficient use of the existing infrastructure relates closely to multiagent systems as many problems in traffic management and control are inherently distributed. In particular, traffic signal controllers located at intersections can be seen as autonomous agents. However, challenging issues are involved in this kind of modeling: the number of agents is high; in general agents must be highly adaptive; they must react to changes in the environment at individual level while also causing an unpredictable collective pattern, as they act in a highly coupled environment. Therefore, traffic signal control poses many challenges for standard techniques from multiagent systems such as learning. Despite the progress in multiagent reinforcement learning via formalisms based on stochastic games, these cannot cope with a high number of agents due to the combinatorial explosion in the number of joint actions. One possible way to reduce the complexity of the problem is to have agents organized in groups of limited size so that the number of joint actions is reduced. These groups are then coordinated by another agent, a tutor or supervisor. Thus, this paper investigates the task of multiagent reinforcement learning for control of traffic signals in two situations: agents act individually (individual learners) and agents can be ""tutored"", meaning that another agent with a broader sight will recommend a joint action. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, trust modelling of web services, managed in an autonomous way by intelligent agents, is a challenging and relevant issue. Due to the dynamic and distributed nature of web services, recommendations of web services from third parties may also play an important role to build and update automated trust models. In this context, the agent reputation and trust (ART) testbed has been used to compare trust models in three international competitions. The testbed runs locally and defines an ART appraisal domain with a simulation engine, although the trust models may be applied to any kind of automated and remote services, such as web services. Our previous works proposed an already-published trust model called AFRAS that used fuzzy sets to represent reputation of service providers and of recommenders of such services. In this paper we describe the extension required in the trust model to participate in these competitions. The extension consists of a trust strategy that applies the AFRAS trust model to the ART testbed concepts and protocols. An implementation of this extension of AFRAS trust model has participated in the (Spanish and International) 2006 ART competitions. Using this ART platform and some of the agents who participated, we executed a set of ART games to evaluate the relevance of trust strategy over trust model, and the advantage of using fuzzy representation of trust and reputation. © Springer-Verlag 2009.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-77951938917

Two questions are considered in this paper: what and when to communicate. To answer these questions, we developed a human-robot communication framework which makes use of common probabilistic robotics representations. The data stored in the representation determines what to communicate, and probabilistic inference mechanisms determine when to communicate. One application domain of the framework is collaborative human-robot decision making: robots use decision theory to select actions based on perceptual information gathered from their sensors and human operators. In this paper, operators are regarded as remotely located, valuable information sources which need to be managed carefully. Robots decide when to query operators using Value-Of-Information theory, i.e. humans are only queried if the expected benefit of their observation exceeds the cost of obtaining it. This can be seen as a mechanism for adjustable autonomy whereby adjustments are triggered at run-time based on the uncertainty in the robots' beliefs related to their task. This semi-autonomous system is demonstrated using a navigation task and evaluated by a user study. Participants navigated a robot in simulation using the proposed system and via classical teleoperation. Results show that our system has a number of advantages over teleoperation with respect to performance, operator workload, usability, and the users' perception of the robot. We also show that despite these advantages, teleoperation may still be a preferable driving mode depending on the mission priorities.

To characterize the factors underlying aggression, men were assigned to one of the four experimental conditions of a computer game in which they were provoked (points were stolen from them or not) and/or received reward for aggression (received points for aggression or not). Men who were provoked but did not receive reward for aggression enjoyed the task the most, demonstrated an increase in salivary testosterone, and were more likely to choose a competitive versus non-competitive task than men in the other experimental conditions. Moreover, individual differences in aggressive behaviour among these men were positively correlated with the extent to which they enjoyed the task and with testosterone fluctuations. These results indicate that costly aggressive behaviour is intrinsically rewarding, perhaps to regulate future interactions, and that testosterone may be a physiological marker of such reward value. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",20381580,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952988441

Thus, people can come to both want something more and like it less. Two experiments illustrate such disjunctions following jilting experiences. In Experiment 1, participants who failed to win a prize were willing to pay more for it than those who won it, but were also more likely to trade it away when they ultimately obtained it. In Experiment 2, failure to obtain an expected reward led to increased choice, but also negatively biased evaluation, of an item that was merely similar to that reward. Such disjunctions were exhibited particularly by individuals low in intensity of felt affect, a finding supporting an emotional basis for relative harmonization of wanting and liking.

The present study investigated the capacity of presleep video-game playing to extend sleep latency and reduce subjective feelings of sleepiness in adolescents. The arousing psychophysiologic mechanisms involved and the impact of presleep video-game playing on sleep architecture were also explored. Method: Thirteen male adolescent ""evening types"" (mean age = 16.6 years, SD = 1.1) participated in a counterbalanced, within-subjects design with experimental (active video gaming) and control (passive DVD watching) conditions. The experiment was conducted in the Flinders University Sleep Research Laboratory. Results: Relative to the control condition, presleep video-game playing increased sleep-onset latency (Z = 2.45, p = .01) and reduced subjective sleepiness (Z = 2.36, p = .02) - but only slightly. Video gaming was related to changes in cognitive alertness (as measured by α power: p < 0.01) but not physiologic arousal (as measured by heart rate: p > 0.05). Contrary to previous findings, sleep architecture was unaffected (both rapid eye movement and slow wave sleep: p > 0.05).

The distances covered in high-intensity running (HIR) and sprinting were longer (p < 0.05) in INT compared with DOM. More (p < 0.05) HIR was covered in INT than DOM during first and second half. Additionally, more (p < 0.05) sprinting occurred in INT compared with DOM in the first half.

The feedback did not seem to affect the game experience (such as sense of control and tension) or the objective indicators of relaxation, alpha activity and heart rate. The results are discussed with regard to clinical neurofeedback studies. The second goal was to look into possible interactions between the two BCI paradigms used in the game: steady-state visually-evoked potentials (SSVEP) as an indicator of concentration, and alpha activity as a measure of relaxation.

This paper proposes a method applying adjustable distraction (AD) to determine presence as immersion (Lombard and Ditton in At the heart of it all: the concept of presence, Department of Broadcasting, Telecommunications and Mass Media, Temple University, 1997) at selectable events (approximated real-time). Two experiments were conducted to investigate its applicability in computer games and movies with respectively visual and tactile AD. The first experiment examined whether the experienced intensity in a survival-shooter game, measured through questionnaires, was proportional to results from the AD method. The intrusiveness of the AD method was also addressed in the experiment by comparing the immersive presence ratings in a between-groups design. The second experiment investigated whether heart rate measurements, intensity ratings and the results of the AD method with vibration as the distraction signal were proportional when test participants watched a movie clip. The outcome of the first experiment indicated that no significant intrusion is caused by the method. In addition, results showed no proportionality between the AD method and intensity ratings. However, as the AD measurements were supported by flow theory, it might be that the results from the AD method using visual distraction are giving a more comprehensive indication of presence as immersion (rather than just the intensity dimension). The second experiment revealed proportionality between the intensity ratings and the heart rate measurements, while the results from the tactile AD method were not proportional. We suspect that this was caused by the great variance found across the test participants' thresholds of perceivable vibration. Because of this, it is suggested that a thorough screening process is conducted pre-test if the AD method should apply vibration as the distracting stimulus. © 2009 Springer-Verlag London Limited.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952880925

In search of explanations for such behavior, it has been argued that at least some individuals have a general tendency to behave altruistically independent of profitability. In fact, a stable altruistic trait would be adaptive if it were recognizable. Then, altruists could choose each other in order to retain benefits through mutual cooperation. Previous research has shown that individuals can predict the degree of altruistic behavior of strangers by reading signs of emotions evoked in significant social decisions. However, the identification of benevolent emotional states is no guarantee of the existence of permanent altruistic traits, though permanent traits are the preferable criterion for selection of good interaction partners. In this study, we tested whether individuals are able to identify altruistic traits. Judges watched 20-s silent video clips of unacquainted target persons and were asked to estimate the behavior of these target persons in a money-sharing task. As the videotapes of the target persons had been recorded in a setting unrelated to altruistic behavior, the judges could not base their estimates on situational cues related to the money-sharing task but instead had to draw on stable signals of altruism. Estimates were significantly better than chance, indicating that individuals can identify permanent altruistic traits in others. As this mechanism raises opportunities for selective interactions between altruists, our findings are discussed with respect to their relevance for explaining the evolution of altruism through assortment. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

A subculture of students at each university form social bonds with fellow fans, develop expertise in college basketball rules, team statistics, and individual players, and self-identify as a member of a fan group. The present study capitalized on the high personal investment of these fans and the strong affective tenor of a Duke-UNC basketball game to examine the neural correlates of emotional memory retrieval for a complex sporting event. Male fans watched a competitive, archived game in a social setting. During a subsequent functional magnetic resonance imaging session, participants viewed video clips depicting individual plays of the game that ended with the ball being released toward the basket. For each play, participants recalled whether or not the shot went into the basket. Hemodynamic signal changes time locked to correct memory decisions were analyzed as a function of emotional intensity and valence, according to the fan's perspective. Results showed intensity-modulated retrieval activity in midline cortical structures, sensorimotor cortex, the striatum, and the medial temporal lobe, including the amygdala. Positively valent memories specifically recruited processing in dorsal frontoparietal regions, and additional activity in the insula and medial temporal lobe for positively valent shots recalled with high confidence. This novel paradigm reveals how brain regions implicated in emotion, memory retrieval, visuomotor imagery, and social cognition contribute to the recollection of specific plays in the mind of a sports fan.

Recent animal research suggests that hypocretins may also influence reward-related behaviors. In humans, the loss of hypocretin-containing neurons results in a major sleep-wake disorder called narcolepsy-cataplexy, which is associated with emotional disturbances. Here, we aim to test whether narcoleptic patients show an abnormal pattern of brain activity during reward processing. Methods: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging in 12 unmedicated patients with narcolepsy-cataplexy to measure the neural responses to expectancy and experience of monetary gains and losses. We statistically compared the patients' data with those obtained in a group of 12 healthy matched controls. Results and Interpretation: Our results reveal that activity in the dopaminergic ventral midbrain (ventral tegmental area) was not modulated in narcolepsy-cataplexy patients during high reward expectancy (unlike controls), and that ventral striatum activity was reduced during winning. By contrast, the patients showed abnormal activity increases in the amygdala and in dorsal striatum for positive outcomes. In addition, we found that activity in the nucleus accumbens and the ventral-medial prefrontal cortex correlated with disease duration, suggesting that an alternate neural circuit could be privileged over the years to control affective responses to emotional challenges and compensate for the lack of influence from ventral midbrain regions.

This study evaluates the effectiveness of simulator and multimedia educational tools in India. Methods: Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) certified paramedic students in India were randomized to either Simulation, Multimedia, or Reading for a 3-h ACLS refresher course. Simulation students received a lecture and 10 simulator cases. The Multimedia group viewed the American Heart Association (AHA) ACLS video and played a computer game. The Reading group independently read with an instructor present. Students were tested prior to (pre-test), immediately after (post-test), and 3 weeks after (short-term retention test), their intervention. During each testing stage subjects completed a cognitive, multiple-choice test and two cardiac arrest scenarios. Changes in exam performance were analyzed for significance. A survey was conducted asking students' perceptions of their assigned modality. Results: One hundred and seventeen students were randomized to Simulation (n = 39), Multimedia (n = 38), and Reading (n = 40). Simulation demonstrated greater improvement managing cardiac arrest scenarios compared to both Multimedia and Reading on the post-test (9% versus 5% and 2%, respectively, p < 0.05) and Reading on the short-term retention test (6% versus -1%, p < 0.05). Multimedia showed significant improvement on cognitive, short-term retention testing compared to Simulation and Reading (5% versus 0% and 0%, respectively, p < 0.05).

If multiple nodes cache the same file to provide others, we can achieve a dependable file-sharing system with low latency and high file availability. However, a node has to spend costs, e. g., processing load or storage capacity, on caching a file. Consequently, a node may selfishly behave and hesitate to cache a file. In such a case, unpopular files are likely to disappear from the system. In this paper, we aim to reveal whether effective caching in the whole system emerges from autonomous and selfish node behavior. We discuss relationship between selfish node behavior and system dynamics by using evolutionary game theory. Through theoretic analysis, we show that a file-sharing system can be robust to file disappearance depending on a cost and demand model for caching even if nodes behave selfishly. Furthermore, we also conduct several simulation-based analysis in terms of network structures, evolving network, load balancing, and system stability. As a result, we demonstrate that a file-sharing system with good properties, i.e., robustness to file disappearance, low search latency, well load-balancing, and high stability, can be achieved independent of network structures and dynamics. © Springer Science + Business Media, LLC 2009.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-77349115194

Background: Futuristic unmanned vehicles systems will invert the operator-to-vehicle ratio so that one operator can control multiple dissimilar vehicles connected through a decentralized network. Significant human-automation collaboration will be needed because of automation brittleness, but such collaboration could cause high workload. Method: Three increasing levels of replanning were tested on an existing multiple unmanned vehicle simulation environment that leverages decentralized algorithms for vehicle routing and task allocation in conjunction with human supervision. Results: Rapid replanning can cause high operator workload, ultimately resulting in poorer overall system performance. Poor performance was associated with a lack of operator consensus for when to accept the automations suggested prompts for new plan consideration as well as negative attitudes toward unmanned aerial vehicles in general. Participants with video game experience tended to collaborate more with the automation, which resulted in better performance. Conclusion: In decentralized unmanned vehicle networks, operators who ignore the automations requests for new plan consideration and impose rapid replans both increase their own workload and reduce the ability of the vehicle network to operate at its maximum capacity.

Those domains range from existing research areas such as computer networks and collective robotics to upcoming areas of agent-based and insect-based computing; also including applications on the internet and in games and movies. CI systems are complex by nature and (1) are effectively adaptive in uncertain and unknown environments, (2) can organise themselves autonomously, and (3) exhibit 'emergent' behaviour. Among others, multi-agent systems, complex adaptive systems, swarm intelligence and self-organising systems are considered to be such systems. The explosive wild growth of research studies of CI systems has not yet led to a systematic approach for model design of these kinds of systems. Although there have been recent efforts on the issue of system design (the complete design trajectory from identifying system requirements up to implementation), the problem of choosing and specifying a good model of a CI system is often done implicitly and sometimes even completely ignored. The aim of this article is to bring to the attention that model design is an essential as well as an integral part of system design. We present a constructive approach to systematically design, build and test models of CI systems. Because simulation is often used as a way to research CI systems, we particularly focus on models that can be used for simulation. Additionally, we show that it is not necessary to re-invent the wheel: here, we show how existing models and algorithms can be used for CI model design. The approach is illustrated by means of two example studies on a (semi-automated) multi-player game and collaborative robotics. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

In the games the environmental context, mouse gestures, and physiological arousal-as indicated by heart rate and skin conductance-were kept constant. In the violent game soldiers had to be shot, in the peaceful game sunflowers had to be watered, and the abstract game simply required clicking colored triangles. Five minutes of play did not alter trait aggressiveness, yet an Implicit Association Test detected a change in implicit aggressive selfconcept. Playing a violent game produced a significant increase in implicit aggressive self-concept relative to playing a peaceful game.

The ISR system is comprised of two MAVs, the Relay and the Rover, and a Base. The Relay strives to position itself so as to minimize the radio frequency (RF) power required for maintaining communications between the Rover and the Base, while the Rover performs the ISR mission, which may maximize the required RF power. The optimal control of the Relay MAV then entails the solution of a differential game. Applying Pontryagin's Maximum Principle yields a standard, albeit nonlinear, Two-Point Boundary Value Problem (TPBVP). Suboptimal solutions are first obtained as an aid in solving the TPBVP which yields the solution of the differential game. One suboptimal approach is based upon the geometry of the ISR system: The midpoint between the Rover and the Base is the ideal location which minimizes the RF power required, so the Relay heads toward that point-assuming that the Rover is stationary. At the same time, to maximize the rate of required RF power, the Rover moves in the opposite direction of the Relay-assuming the Relay is stationary. These are optimal strategies in the end-game, but it is suboptimal to use them throughout the game. Another suboptimal approach investigated envisions the Rover to remain stationary and solves for the optimal path for the Relay to minimize the RF power requirement.

Adequate pre-participation screening is a crucial part of prevention, however, current ACC, AHA or ESC guidelines are not uniform in this context. There is recently ongoing discussion on implementation of 12-lead ECG to the screening protocol. Aim: To assess the prevalence of alterations of resting 12-lead ECG in a population of top-level professional athletes - members of the Polish Olympic Team - using recently accepted criteria. Methods: During the period of intensive training before the Summer Olympic Games in Beijing (2008), a 12-lead, resting ECG was performed in 73 members (20 women and 53 men) of the Polish Olympic Team. Commonly accepted criteria were used to assess the ECG, and alterations were divided into two groups according to recent publications: group I - 'benign', common - thought to be consistent with the athlete's heart syndrome (i.e.: sinus bradycardia, 1st degree atrioventricular block, early repolarisation, right bundle branch hemiblock, isolated signs of left ventricular hypertrophy); and group II - 'suspected', uncommon - which may occur due to organic heart disease (i.e. complete bundle branch block, ventricular arrhythmia, inverse T wave or pathological QRS axis deviation). Results: Completely normal ECG was present in 11% of those examined, common (group I) findings were observed in 65% and 'suspected' (group II) in 23%. The most commonly occurring 'benign' findings were bradycardia incomplete, right bundle branch block and isolated left ventricular hypertrophy, found in 75, 71 and 41%, respectively. From 'suspected' (group II) the most frequent was left posterior fascicular hemiblock, present in 10% of those examined; other findings were complete right bundle branch block, left atrial hypertrophy, inverse T waves and left anterior fascicular hemiblock in single cases. Conclusions: 1. Most of the observed alterations in resting ECG of professional athletes belong to the 'common' group and result from adaptation to exercise. 2. Frequent occurrence of left posterior fascicular hemiblock, which is thought to be 'potentially malignant', requires further investigation.",20017075,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-72249118003

The data indicate that games are systematically used after exposure to stressful situations and strain, and that recovery experience is a significant facet of the gaming experience. Using structural equation modeling, the relationships among work-related fatigue, daily hassles, social support, coping style, recovery experience, and the use of video and computer games for recovery purposes were tested. Persons who associated stronger recovery experiences with game play used video and computer games more often after stressful and exhausting situations. In addition, participants' level of work-related fatigue and exposure to daily hassles were both positively associated with the use of games for recovery. Participants with emotion-focused coping style showed a higher tendency to use games for recovery than participants with problem-focused coping style. The relationship between work-related fatigue and game use for recovery purposes was moderated by social support. The stress buffering function of video and computer games was more important for participants receiving less social support.

On the other hand, the players might understand virtual violent acts as a digital form of rough-and-tumble play, associated with positive emotions and mobilization, which in turn should raise performance. To test these competing hypotheses on game performance, N= 50 males with no prior violent gaming experience were exposed to three different versions of a custom-made video game in which the actions to be performed were identical, though they were audio-visually presented to appear either nonviolent, moderately, or extremely violent. The results show no indication of an initial inhibition of aggressive behavior, that is, performance is elevated and remains so if the action is presented audio-visually as being violent.

Educational systems have based their learning strategies almost solely at a cognitive level and the internal state of the learner has often been ignored. Even if it is now recognized that learners' personalities and learning styles influence greatly their cognitive process (e.g. Multiple intelligences), very few systems have managed to profile users and adapt the educational content accordingly. Part of the reason for this is the difficulty to measure learning styles reliably and to establish a valid model that accounts for most of the major factors contributing to learning. Furthermore, since the introduction of formal education, it can be argued that learning has lost its playful and emotional aspect, whereby information was transmitted through story telling and play. On the other hand, video games have become a very popular medium among our digital natives. They provide a rich sensory and emotional environment in which they can experience a state of flow and are willing to stay for extended period of time. Despite of initial preconceptions on the negative effect of video games on young adults, it is now admitted that video games implicitly include many instructional design strategies (collaboration, exploration, Socratic dialogues, zone of proximal development, etc.) that could be harnessed to make formal education an experience that is more interactive and rewarding. One of the key features of video games is the ability to provide a content that matches players' emotional needs (e.g. recognition, social bounding, self-esteem, etc.) and that provides a wide range of interaction. The authors believe that this potential can be harnessed to create an educational content that matches users' learning styles and motivations. They propose the PLEASE model (Personality Learning styles, Emotions, Autonomy, Systematic Approach and Evaluation). This model addresses some of educational games design issues (e.g. choice of instructional strategy, type of feedback required, etc.); it categorizes and profiles users' learning styles in the light of educational and personality theories and defines a set of practical strategies for educational games designers in order to match students' learning styles and provide a user-centred content that is both motivating and educational. The authors explain how the Big-5 can be a more reliable alternative to measure learning styles, how emotions and personalities can be accounted in the cognitive process (e.g. information retrieval, memory retention, etc.) and also describe experiments they carried out in Cork to assess the effect of user-centred approaches in educational game design. Results are analysed and contrasted with current practices to show that unless personalities are accounted for in educational games, the educational outcomes could be different or even opposite to the one expected. © 2009, IGI Global.",,"English",Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-84901515678

Such logics are specifically intended to support reasoning about game-theoretic properties of multi-agent systems.

The multi-player aspect of serious games is related to theories of ""collaborative learning"" which is broken down into a discussion of ""discourse"" versus ""dialogue"". Several general guiding principles are explored, such as the use of ""metaphor"" (including metaphors of space, embodiment, systems thinking, the internet and emergence). The topological design of a serious game is also highlighted. The discussion of pedagogy is related to various serious games we have recently produced and researched, and is presented in the hope of informing the ""serious game community"". © 2009, IGI Global.",,"English",Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-84892921036

In each of these technologies, processing power and functionality levels are continuing to increase, resulting in increased thermal management issues. The former of these technologies already use an active cooling solution with a profile of 1015 mm while the latter two are quickly approaching the limits of passive cooling. Since a common characteristic in each of these technologies is the desire to reduce profile height, there exists a need to develop low profile cooling solutions that are capable of supporting this growing market. However, a prerequisite to developing such solutions is an accurate understanding of how the noise level characteristics of the driving fans scale with height. This paper experimentally addresses the acoustic scaling of low profile fans. The rotor heights range from 0.5 mm to 15 mm with diameters from 15 mm to 32 mm, giving an aspect ratio of height relative to diameter of 0.030.6. The results can be used as a foundation for the development of active cooling in mobile devices where both correlations for noise levels and basic design criteria are identified. © 2009 IEEE.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-72149094575

It is therefore likely that a specific neural mechanism underlies the detection of social exclusion. Similarly, specific neural mechanisms may underlie the beneficial effects of emotional support. Although neuroimaging researchers have recently examined the neural basis of social pain, there is presently no agreement as to which part of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is involved in the perception and modulation of social pain. We hypothesized that activity in those brain regions that are associated with social pain would be correlated with decrements in social pain induced by emotional support. To examine the effects of emotional support on social pain caused by exclusion, we conducted an fMRI study in which participants played a virtual ball-tossing game. Participants were initially included and later excluded from the game. In the latter half of the session from which participants were excluded, participants received emotionally supportive text messages. We found that emotional support led to increased activity in the left lateral/medial prefrontal cortices and some temporal regions. Those individuals who experienced greater attenuation of social pain exhibited lower ventral ACC and higher left lateral prefrontal cortex activation. These results suggest that the ventral ACC underlies social pain, and that emotional support enhances prefrontal cortex activity, which in turn may lead to a weakened affective response.",19562631,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650603070

Previous studies have identified an extensive network of brain areas involved in familiar face recognition, but there is little evidence to date concerning the neural bases of negative vs. positive person impressions. In the present study, participants were repeatedly exposed to 16 unfamiliar face identities within a pseudo-interactive game context to generate a perception of either ""friends"" or ""foes"". Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was then performed during an old/new memory task to assess any difference in brain responses to these now familiar face identities, relative to unfamiliar faces. Importantly, whereas facial expressions were always emotional (either smiling or angry) during the encoding phase, they were always neutral during the memory task. Our results reveal that several brain regions involved in familiar face recognition, including fusiform cortex, posterior cingulate gyrus, and amygdala, plus additional areas involved in motivational control such as caudate and anterior cingulate cortex, were differentially modulated as a function of a previous encounter, and generally more activated when faces were perceived as ""foes"" rather than ""friends"".

The commercial success of these devices depends significantly on the duration of autonomous operation. This class of products therefore requires low power consumption as well as high or medium performance, which in turn depends on the technology and the design techniques used. For cost and reliability issues the preferred components for implementation of state-of-the-art portable devices are System-on-Chip (SoC) ICs. The SoC integrates many functions such as digital, memory, analog mixed-signal, and often radio-frequency functions, all on one chip. To satisfy requirements of multimedia applications, SoCs embed Static-Random-Access-Memory modules (SRAM), which occupy more than 60% of the total SoC area and are responsible for a large portion of the total power consumption. Therefore, the SRAM module is required to have both high operating performance to deal with multimedia applications and low power consumption to prolong battery life. Active power consumption of CMOS logic circuits increases quadrati-cally with supply voltage; hence, minimizing the supply voltage is one of the most effective ways to reduce energy usage but unfortunately this comes at the expense of lower speed. To get the best trade-off, supply voltage and threshold voltage scaling along with process is needed. However the increase of leakage current limits the threshold voltage reduction as well as the supply voltage scaling. Moreover, in 45 nm technology and below, voltage scaling becomes very complex due to the difficulty of the SRAM operation. In fact, in order to achieve very high density, the SRAM cell is implemented with the smallest size MOS transistors, which in turn are more and more impacted by the increase of process fluctuations. It results in many obstacles to overcome to achieve low-voltage operation, such as adequate read margin, write ability and operating speed [1]. © 2009 Springer Netherlands.",,"English",Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-84890244617

To determine whether an exercise intervention using an active video game (Dance Dance Revolution™ [DDR]) is effective in improving endothelial dysfunction (EDF) and other risk factors in overweight children. Design. Thirty-five children (Body mass index ≥ 85th percentile, mean age 10.21±1.67 years, 17 females) with EDF were assessed for flow-mediated dilation (FMD), lipids, insulin, glucose, NO2+NO3, asymmetric dimethylarginine, symmetric dimethylarginine, l-arginine, height, weight, aerobic fitness, and blood pressure. In a subsample, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, and adiponectin were also assessed. Subjects were randomly assigned to 12-weeks of aerobic exercise (EX) using DDR or to a non-exercising delayed-treatment control group (DTC). Results. EX had significant improvements in FMD ( 5.56±5.04% compared with 0.263±4.54%, p=0.008), exercise time on the graded exercise test (53.59±91.54 compared with -12.83±68.10 seconds, p=0.025), mean arterial pressure (MAP) (-5.62±7.03 compared with-1.44±2.16 mmHg, p=0.05), weight (0.91±1.53 compared with 2.43±1.80 kg, p=0.017) and peak VO2 (2.38±3.91 compared with-1.23±3.18 mg/kg/min, p=0.005) compared with the DTC.

The wasp larvae gall and eat developing seeds. Although fig trees benefit from allowing wasps to oviposit, because the wasp offspring disperse pollen, figs must prevent wasps from ovipositing in all flowers, or seed production would cease, and the mutualism would go extinct. In Ficus racemosa, we find that syconia ('figs') that have few foundresses (ovipositing wasps) are underexploited in the summer (few seeds, few galls, many empty ovules) and are overexploited in the winter (few seeds, many galls, few empty ovules). Conversely, syconia with many foundresses produce intermediate numbers of galls and seeds, regardless of season. We use experiments to explain these patterns, and thus, to explain how this mutualism is maintained. In the hot summer, wasps suffer short lifespans and therefore fail to oviposit in many flowers. In contrast, cooler temperatures in the winter permit longer wasp lifespans, which in turn allows most flowers to be exploited by the wasps. However, even in winter, only in syconia that happen to have few foundresses are most flowers turned into galls. In syconia with higher numbers of foundresses, interference competition reduces foundress lifespans, which reduces the proportion of flowers that are galled. We further show that syconia encourage the entry of multiple foundresses by delaying ostiole closure. Taken together, these factors allow fig trees to reduce galling in the wasp-benign winter and boost galling (and pollination) in the wasp-stressing summer. Interference competition has been shown to reduce virulence in pathogenic bacteria. Our results show that interference also maintains cooperation in a classic, cooperative symbiosis, thus linking theories of virulence and mutualism. More generally, our results reveal how frequency-dependent population regulation can occur in the fig-wasp mutualism, and how a host species can 'set the rules of the game' to ensure mutualistic behavior in its symbionts. © 2009 Wang et al.",19915668,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-70649104034

Slow deep breathing has been proposed as an effective method to decrease pain. However, experimental studies conducted to validate this claim have not been carried out. Design. We measured thermal pain threshold and tolerance scores from 20 healthy adults during five different conditions, namely, during natural breathing (baseline), slow deep breathing (6 breaths/minute), rapid breathing (16 breaths/minute), distraction (video game), and heart rate (HR) biofeedback. We measured respiration (rate and depth) and HR variability from the electrocardiogram (ECG) output and analyzed the effects of respiration on pain and HR variability using time and frequency domain measures of the ECG. Results. Compared with baseline, thermal pain threshold was significantly higher during slow deep breathing (P = 0.002), HR biofeedback (P < 0.001), and distraction (P = 0.006), whereas thermal pain tolerance was significantly higher during slow deep breathing (P = 0.003) and HR biofeedback (P < 0.001). Compared with baseline, only slow deep breathing and HR biofeedback conditions had an effect on cardiac activity. These conditions increased the amplitude of vagal cardiac markers (peak-to-valley, P < 0.001) as well as low frequency power (P < 0.001). Conclusion. Slow deep breathing and HR biofeedback had analgesic effects and increased vagal cardiac activity. Distraction also produced analgesia; however, these effects were not accompanied by concomitant changes in cardiac activity.

However, there are still many open questions. In this paper, we address some of these questions by investigating the effects of time-varying, non-symmetric rewards on the evolution of cooperation in the spatial Prisoner's dilemma game. The rationale behind this approach is based on the notion that the associated payoffs from pursuing certain strategies do vary among members of real-world populations. In our model, agents with limited cognitive capacity play the game with their local neighbours. In addition to its game playing strategy, each agent has additional attributes that can be used to control the number of rounds of the game the agent actually participates in, as well as the magnitude of any rewards that it receives. Numerical simulations show that dynamic updates to payoff values induce a change in equilibrium cooperation levels. This suggests that heterogeneous payoff values and social diversity within a cost-benefit context are important factors in the promotion of cooperation in the spatial Prisoner's dilemma game. © Springer-Verlag 2009.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-77949772159

They offer huge digital environments characterized by tens of thousands of users interacting with each other. Efficiently managing these online worlds requires scalable architectures to distribute the load over multiple servers and maintain a high Quality of Experience (QoE). This need will only increase as online virtual worlds become more and more popular. A traditional approach to improve the scalability of this type of system is to statically partition the virtual world in smaller segments called cells, each assigned to a dedicated server. In this paper a novel approach of dividing the virtual world into even smaller parts called microcells is introduced. Critical in this approach are the algorithms that manage the microcell allocation over the available servers. These algorithms must face a number of challenges and have as a central goal to keep the load experienced by the servers below a given threshold. On one hand, clustering interacting microcells on one server allows to limit the overall load by minimizing the communication overhead. On the other hand, locating too many microcells on one server may cause the load to violate the threshold value, resulting in an overload situation. In this paper we present a number of algorithms that determine the microcell allocation and runtime adaptations of the microcell allocation to optimize the deployment. We evaluate the microcell approach by studying the impact of the microcell size and the number of servers. The efficiency of the algorithms in terms of their ability to decrease the maximum server load and their capability to maintain an ideal deployment in dynamic environments is also studied. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Each of these has an abrupt onset and endpoint and when accompanied by unhealthy coronary arteries can cause chest pain and, potentially, an acute cardiac event. SVT is about twice as common in women as it is in men and the condition is generally thought to arise because of a person's anatomy, that is, there is more than one electrical pathway carrying the electrical impulse from the atrium to the ventricle.

Based on self-determination theory 1 and the dualistic model of passion,2 the authors hypothesized that high levels of basic psychological need satisfaction would foster harmonious passion for video play, supporting the subjective sense that play is something one wants to do. It was also predicted that low levels of need satisfaction would promote obsessive passion for games and contribute to the feeling that game play is something one feels compelled to or has to do. It was expected, in turn, that passion for play would directly influence player outcomes closely tied to games, moderate links between play and well-being, and relate to overall levels of well-being as a function of basic need satisfaction. As expected, results showed that low levels of basic need satisfaction were associated with more obsessive passion, higher amounts of play, greater tension following play, and low game enjoyment, whereas high levels of need satisfaction did not predict hours of play but were associated with more harmonious passion, game enjoyment, and energy following play. Moderation analyses showed that high amounts of play related negatively to well-being only to the extent that players reported an obsessive passion and that the unique relations between passion and overall levels of player well-being were quite small once controlling for their basic need satisfaction in daily life. Discussion of the current findings focuses on their significance for understanding disordered play and the value of applying a theory-based approach to study motivation for virtual contexts. © 2009 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",19772442,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350114429

In this study, each participant played three games with a humanoid robot that played a drum whilst simultaneously making (or not making) head gestures. The three games included the participant interacting with the real robot (physical embodiment condition), interacting with a hidden robot when only the sound of the robot is heard (disembodiment condition; note that the term 'disembodiment' is used in this paper specifically to refer to an experimental condition where a physical robot produces the sound cues, but is not visible to the participants), or interacting with a real-time image of the robot (virtual embodiment condition). We used a mixed design where repeated measures were used to evaluate embodiment effects and independent-groups measures were used to study the gestures effects. Data from the implementation of a human-robot interaction experiment with 66 children are presented, and statistically analyzed in terms of participants' subjective experiences and drumming performance of the human-robot pair. The subjective experiences showed significant differences for the different embodiment conditions when gestures were used in terms of enjoyment of the game, and perceived intelligence and appearance of the robot. The drumming performance also differed significantly within the embodiment conditions and the presence of gestures increased these differences significantly. The presence of a physical, embodied robot enabled more interaction, better drumming and turn-taking, as well as enjoyment of the interaction, especially when the robot used gestures. © 2009 VSP.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-71049148819

Methods: Two evaluations were performed approximately 1.5 years apart on 399 youths and young adults (189 European Americans [EAs] and 210 African Americans [AAs]; 190 males and 209 females). HRV was measured at rest and during a video game challenge. Results: AAs showed significantly higher resting root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) of normal R-R intervals and high-frequency (HF) power than EAs (ps < 0.01). Females displayed larger decrease of RMSSD and HF during video game challenge than males (ps < 0.05). These ethnic and sex differences were consistent across 1.5 years. No significant sex difference of resting HRV or ethnic difference of HRV response to stress was observed.

However, music and task performance studies have tended to be experimenter-centred and contextually isolated, largely independent of the listener's music practices and preference. The present study adopted a listener-centred approach to compare the effects of self-selected and experimenter-selected music (high and low arousal), on concurrent activity performance and experience. 125 participants completed three laps of a driving game in either (i) silence (ii) car sounds alone; car sounds with the addition of (iii) self-selected music, (iv) High-Arousal music or (v) Low-Arousal music. Three performance measures (accuracy-collisions, time-ms, and speed-mph) and 5 experience measures (distraction, liking, appropriateness, enjoyment, and tension-anxiety) were taken. Participants exposed to their self-selected music were most efficient, perceived lowest distraction, highest enjoyment, liking and appropriateness, and experienced a reduction in tension-anxiety. In contrast, performance and experience were poorest when exposed to High-Arousal experimenter-selected music. Participants were most inaccurate, perceived highest distraction, lowest liking, enjoyment and appropriateness, and experienced an increase in tension-anxiety. Collectively, the findings highlight the efficacy of self-selected music as a tool to optimise response in the everyday activity context for which it is selected. Accordingly, the results are discussed in relation to potential implications for the performance and experience of concurrent tasks such as video games. Additionally, the discussion highlights theories of attention-distraction, arousal and affect modification, and subjective experiences of music listening. © 2009 by ESCOM European Society for the Cognitive Sciences of Music.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954548013

Steady gait walking at1 km.hr-1 was achieved by all the children in less than 1 minute. There was no significant difference between computer game score during seated and walking play modes and no increase in energy cost when computer game play was added to walking (p &gt; 0.05). When given the choice in the home, all chose to use the walking media station rather than play seated.

METHODS: Energy expenditure, heart rate, step rate, and perceived exertion were measured in 14 boys and 9 girls (ages 10-13 years; BMI at 3-98th percentile for age and gender) while watching television at rest, playing DDR at 2 skill levels, playing Wii bowling and boxing, and walking at 2.6, 4.2, and 5.7 km/h. Arterial elasticity was measured at rest and immediately after gaming. RESULTS: Compared with watching television, energy expenditure while gaming or walking increased 2-to 3-fold. Similarly, high rates of energy expenditure, heart rate, and perceived exertion were elicited from playing Wii boxing, DDR level 2, or walking at 5.7 km/h. This occurred despite variations in step rate among activities, reflecting greater use of upper body during Wii play (lowest step rate) than during walking (highest step rate) or DDR play. Wii bowling and beginner level DDR elicited a 2-fold increase in energy expenditure compared to television watching. Large-artery elasticity declined immediately after both DDR and Wii. The change was inversely related to the increment in energy expenditure above rest achieved during the activity. CONCLUSIONS: Energy expenditure during active video game play is comparable to moderate-intensity walking. Thus, for children who spend considerable time playing electronic screen games for entertainment, physically active games seem to be a safe, fun, and valuable means of promoting energy expenditure.

The effective application of VEs in emotionally intense simulations requires precise control over their characteristics that affect the user's emotions and behavior. It is known that humans have an innate fear of darkness, which increases after exposure to stress and extrapolates to ecologically valid (immersive) VEs. This study investigated if the simulated level of illumination determines the affective appraisal of a VE, particularly after stress. Participants explored either a daytime or a nighttime version of a VE, after performing either an acute psychosocial stress task (Trier Social Stress Test, or TSST) or a relaxing control task. The affective qualities of the VE were appraised through the Russel and Pratt semantic questionnaire on the valence and arousal dimensions. Distress was assessed through free salivary cortisol, the state self-report scale from the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and heart rate. In addition, memory for scenic details was tested through a yes-no recognition test. Free salivary cortisol levels, heart rates, and scores on the STAI all indicate that participants who were subjected to the stress task indeed showed signs of distress, whereas participants in the control group showed no signs of stress. The results of the semantic questionnaire and the recognition test showed no significant overall effect of time-of-day conditions on the affective appraisal of the VE or on the recognition of its details, even after prior stress. The experiences of users exploring the VE were not affected by the simulated lighting conditions, even after acute prior stress. Thus, lowering the illumination level in a desktop VE is not sufficient to elicit anxiety. Hence, desktop VE representations are different from immersive VE representations in this respect. This finding has implications for desktop VE representations that are deployed for serious gaming and training purposes. © Copyright 2009, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",19514817,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-68149137128

Instead, they may be motivated to experience even unpleasant emotions when they might be useful for goal attainment. Given that fear serves to promote successful avoidance, these studies tested this hypothesis by examining preferences for fear in preparation for avoidance goal pursuits. Consistent with the predictions of the instrumental approach, participants preferred to increase their level of fear as they prepared to pursue an avoidance goal. Such preferences were higher than preferences for either excitement or anger and were unique to avoidance (vs. approach or confrontational) goal pursuits. Given the aversive nature of fear, these findings clearly demonstrate that people may sometimes prefer to feel bad if doing so can lead to instrumental benefits. © 2009 American Psychological Association.",19653771,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-69049111743

Here, we report incentive-dependent performance decrements in humans in a reward-pursuit task; subjects were less successful in capturing a more valuable reward in a computerized maze. Concurrent functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed that increased activity in ventral midbrain, a brain area associated with incentive motivation and basic reward responding, correlated with both reduced number of captures and increased number of near-misses associated with imminent high rewards.

Our model is based on a probabilistic framework that deals with the high level of uncertainty involved in recognizing a variety of user emotions by combining in a Dynamic Bayesian Network information on both the causes and effects of emotional reactions. The part of the framework that reasons from causes to emotions (diagnostic model) implements a theoretical model of affect, the OCC model, which accounts for how emotions are caused by one's appraisal of the current context in terms of one's goals and preferences. The advantage of using the OCC model is that it provides an affective agent with explicit information not only on which emotions a user feels but also why, thus increasing the agent's capability to effectively respond to the users' emotions. The challenge is that building the model requires having mechanisms to assess user goals and how the environment fits them, a form of plan recognition. In this paper, we illustrate how we built the predictive part of the affective model by combining general theories with empirical studies to adapt the theories to our target application domain. We then present results on the model's accuracy, showing that the model achieves good accuracy on several of the target emotions. We also discuss the model's limitations, to open the ground for the next stage of the work, i.e., complementing the model with diagnostic information. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-68149100832

In a within-subjects design, participants played Super Monkey Ball Jr. and Duke Nukem Advance against a computer, a non co-located friend, and a non co-located stranger. In addition to self-report ratings, electromyographic (EMG) activity over zygomaticus major, corrugator supercilii, and orbicularis oculi; cardiac interbeat intervals; and skin conductance level were measured to index positive activation, negative activation, and physiological arousal. When compared to playing against a computer, playing against a human elicited more positive emotional responses and higher arousal, spatial presence, and engagement. In addition, playing against a friend elicited more positive emotional responses (as indexed by facial EMG) and higher self-reported arousal and engagement compared to playing against a stranger. The influence of opponent type on facial EMG responses was dependent on dispositional behavioral activation system (BAS) and behavioral inhibition system (BIS) sensitivities of the player. Orbicularis oculi EMG responses to game violence varied also as a function of the player's impulsivity. These data show that the mere knowledge of who is controlling the opponent character strongly influences emotional and other responses to digital games. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-70449587516

Political ideology correlated with exploration during the game, with conservatives sampling fewer targets than liberals. Moreover, more conservative individuals exhibited a stronger learning asymmetry, such that they learned negative stimuli better than positive. Mediational analyses revealed that the differences in learning were due to the extent of exploratory behavior during the game.

An evaluation of the physiological demands of elite rugby union using GPS tracking software. J Strength Cond Res 23(4): 1195-1203, 2009-The current case study attempted to document the contemporary demands of elite rugby union. Players (n = 2) were tracked continuously during a competitive team selection game using Global Positioning System (GPS) software. Data revealed that players covered on average 6,953 m during play (83 minutes). Of this distance, 37% (2,800 m) was spent standing and walking, 27% (1,900 m) jogging, 10% (700 m) cruising, 14% (990 m) striding, 5% (320 m) high-intensity running, and 6% (420 m) sprinting. Greater running distances were observed for both players (6.7% back; 10% forward) in the second half of the game. Positional data revealed that the back performed a greater number of sprints (&gt;20 km.h-1) than the forward (34 vs. 19) during the game. Conversely, the forward entered the lower speed zone (6-12 km.h-1) on a greater number of occasions than the back (315 vs. 229) but spent less time standing and walking (66.5 vs. 77.8%). Players were found to perform 87 moderate-intensity runs (&gt;14 km.h-1) covering an average distance of 19.7 m (SD = 14.6). Average distances of 15.3 m (back) and 17.3 m (forward) were recorded for each sprint burst (&gt;20 km.h-1), respectively.

Feedback from five focus groups was used to design the graphics. The final version displayed a matrix of square buttons; clicking on any button allowed the user to see whether the stick figure underneath was affected by the health outcome. When participants used this interaction to learn about a risk, they expressed more emotional responses, both positive and negative, than when viewing any static graphic or numerical description of a risk. Their responses included relief about small risks and concern about large risks. The groups also commented on static graphics: arranging the figures affected by disease randomly throughout a group of figures made it more difficult to judge the proportion affected but often was described as more realistic. Interactive graphics appear to have potential for expressing risk magnitude as well as the feeling of risk. This affective impact could be useful in increasing perceived threat of high risks, calming fears about low risks, or comparing risks.

This methodology links the dynamic capacity of MABS (Multi-Agent-Based Simulation) and the discussion and learning capacity of RPG (Role-Playing Games). Using GMABS, we have developed two prototypes in the natural resources management domain. The first prototype, called JogoMan (Adamatti et. al, 2005), is a paper-based game: all players need to be physically present in the same place and time, and there is a minimum needed number of participants to play the game. In order to avoid this constraint, we have built a second prototype, called ViP-JogoMan (Adamatti et. al, 2007), which is an extension of the first one. This second game enables the insertion of virtual players that can substitute some real players in the game. These virtual players can partially mime real behaviors and capture autonomy, social abilities, reaction and adaptation of the real players. We have chosen the BDI architecture to model these virtual players, since its paradigm is based on folk psychology; hence, its core concepts easily map the language that people use to describe their reasoning and actions in everyday life. ViP-JogoMan is a computer-based game, in which people play via Web, players can be in different places and it does not have a hard constraint regarding the minimum number of real players.

This paper presents a unified framework and control algorithm using particle filters (PFs) for the coordination of multiple pursuers to search for and capture multiple evaders given the ability of PF to estimate highly non-Gaussian densities prevalent in search problems. The pursuer control problem is formulated as a stochastic control problem where global objectives function of both searching and capturing are common. To take the evaders' actions into account, an action measure (AM) is defined over the evaders' PDs is used to represent the probability that the evader may transit each state in the PD. The global objective functions for search and capture are then decomposed into local objective functions for unification through objective priority weights. Coordination between the pursuers takes place through the multi-sensor update where the observation likelihoods of all pursuers are used in the PF update stage. The control actions of each pursuer are then determined individually, based on the updated PDs given the objective weights, action measures as well as evader importance weights in the case of multiple evaders. The proposed algorithm is tested in three scenarios for its effectiveness. In addition, a parametric study on the average capture time against the initial variances of the target state uncertainty is conducted to test for robustness. Results show that the pursuers are able to capture all the evaders in each case with the capture time for the second and last scenario differing by only 2.9% implying firstly that under the proposed algorithm, the capture time is not proportional to the increase in the number of evaders and also suggested robustness and potential scalability of the proposed algorithm. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Pain threshold (elapsed time until the child reported pain) and pain tolerance (total time the child kept the hand submerged in the cold water) were measured for each cold pressor trial. RESULTS: Both distraction conditions resulted in improved pain tolerance relative to baseline. Older children appeared to experience additional benefits from using the helmet, whereas younger children benefited equally from both conditions.

Suitable resource negotiation solutions need to explicitly consider the amount of information exchanged among the users and the computational complexity incurred by the users. In this paper, we propose decentralized solutions for resource negotiation, where multiple autonomous users self-organize into a coalition which shares the same network resources and negotiate the division of these resources by exchanging information about their requirements. We then discuss various resource sharing strategies that the users can deploy based on their exchanged information. Several of these strategies are designed to explicitly consider the utility (i.e., video quality) impact of multimedia applications. In order to quantify the utility benefit derived by exchanging different information, we define a new metric, which we refer to as the value of information. We quantify through simulations the improvements that can be achieved when various information is exchanged between users, and discuss the required complexity at the user side involved in implementing the various resource negotiation strategies. © 2009 IEEE.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-66549128229

As it is often the case, it is not possible to provide additional capacity, so that a more efficient use of the available transportation infrastructure is necessary. This relates closely to multiagent systems as many problems in traffic management and control are inherently distributed. Also, many actors in a transportation system fit very well the concept of autonomous agents: the driver, the pedestrian, the traffic expert; in some cases, also the intersection and the traffic signal controller can be regarded as an autonomous agent. However, the iagentification"" of a transportation system is associated with some challenging issues: the number of agents is high, typically agents are highly adaptive, they react to changes in the environment at individual level but cause an unpredictable collective pattern, and act in a highly coupled environment. Therefore, this domain poses many challenges for standard techniques from multiagent systems such as coordination and learning. This paper has two main objectives: (i) to present problems, methods, approaches and practices in traffic engineering (especially regarding traffic signal control); and (ii) to highlight open problems and challenges so that future research in multiagent systems can address them. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-59849097978

They have to interleave searches with action executions to make the searches tractable when moving autonomously to user-specified coordinates. The searches face real-time requirements since it is important that the agents be responsive to the commands of the users and move smoothly. In this article, we compare two classes of fast heuristic search methods for these navigation tasks that speed up A*searches in different ways, namely real-time heuristic search and incremental heuristic search, to understand their advantages and disadvantages and make recommendations about when each one should be used. We first develop a competitive real-time heuristic search method. LSS-LRTA*is a version of Learning Real-Time A*that uses A*to determine its local search spaces and learns quickly. We analyze the properties of LSS-LRTA*and then compare it experimentally against the state-of-the-art incremental heuristic search method D*Lite on our navigation tasks, for which D*Lite was specifically developed, resulting in the first comparison of real-time and incremental heuristic search in the literature. We characterize when to choose each one of the two heuristic search methods, depending on the search objective and the kind of terrain. Our experimental results show that LSS-LRTA*can outperform D*Lite under the right conditions, namely when there is time pressure or the user-supplied h-values are generally not misleading. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-59849106768

Previously we have shown that allocation of funds in the Dictator Game (DG), a paradigm that illustrates costly altruistic behavior, is partially determined by promoter-region repeat region variants in the arginine vasopressin 1a receptor gene (AVPR1a). In the current investigation, the gene encoding the related oxytocin receptor (OXTR) was tested for association with the DG and a related paradigm, the Social Values Orientation (SVO) task. Methodology/Principal Findings: Association (101 male and 102 female students) using a robust-family based test between 15 single tagging SNPs (htSNPs) across the OXTR was demonstrated with both the DG and SVO. Three htSNPs across the gene region showed significant association with both of the two games. The most significant association was observed with rs1042778 (p=0.001). Haplotype analysis also showed significant associations for both DG and SVO. Following permutation test adjustment, significance was observed for 2-5 locus haplotypes (p<0.05). A second sample of 98 female subjects was subsequently and independently recruited to play the dictator game and was genotyped for the three significant SNPs found in the first sample. The rs1042778 SNP was shown to be significant for the second sample as well (p=0.004, Fisher's exact test). Conclusions: The demonstration that genetic polymorphisms for the OXTR are associated with human prosocial decision making converges with a large body of animal research showing that oxytocin is an important social hormone across vertebrates including Homo sapiens. Individual differences in prosocial behavior have been shown by twin studies to have a substantial genetic basis and the current investigation demonstrates that common variants in the oxytocin receptor gene, an important element of mammalian social circuitry, underlie such individual differences. © 2009 Israel et al.",19461999,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-66249097772

It has long been hypothesised that women differ from men in their mentalizing abilities. In the present fMRI study we examined the impact of (1) gender (women vs. men) and (2) game partner (human vs. computer) on ToM associated neural activity in the medial prefrontal cortex. Groups of men (n = 12) and women (n = 12) interacted in an iterated classical prisoner's dilemma forced choice situation with alleged human and computer partners who were outside the scanner. Results: Both the conditions of playing against putative human as well as computer partners led to activity increases in mPFC, ACC and rTPJ, constituting the classic ToM network. However, mPFC/ACC activity was more pronounced when participants believed they were playing against the alleged human partner. Differences in the medial frontal lobe activation related to the sex of the participants could be demonstrated for the human partner > computer partner contrast. Conclusion: Our data demonstrate differences in medial prefrontal brain activation during a ToM task depending on both the gender of participants and the game partner. © 2009 Krach et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",19193204,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-63249113832

It has been postulated that interactive video game exercise has greater metabolic requirements than traditional cycling; however, this has not been tested to date. Purpose: To examine the metabolic requirements of interactive video game exercise in comparison to traditional stationary cycling at matched incremental workloads. Methods: Fourteen participants (seven males and seven females) were examined during three separate sessions: 1) incremental cycle ergometer exercise for the assessment of maximal aerobic power and peak workload; 2) traditional cycling on a cycle ergometer using 5-min constant workloads of 25%, 50%, and 75% of maximal power output; and 3) cycling using identical constant, relative workloads while playing interactive video games. Measurements of oxygen consumption, heart rate, and rating of perceived exertion were assessed throughout. Results: During interactive video game exercise, steady-state heart rate (26% ± 18% and 14% ± 13%), energy expenditure (61% ± 41% and 25% ± 21%), and oxygen consumption (34% ± 17% and 18% ± 12%) were significantly higher at the constant submaximal workloads of 25% and 50%, respectively. There was no significant difference in rating of perceived exertion between conditions at any workload. Conclusions: Interactive video game cycling results in greater metabolic requirements (despite similar perceptions of exertion) at submaximal constant workloads than traditional cycling.

We and others have previously proposed the concept of stress-induced pressure natriuresis (SIPN) where increased urinary sodium excretion (UNaV) is coupled with elevated blood pressure (BP) in response to behavioral stress in normotensive adolescents. This study thus aimed to test the relationship between prostasin and pressure natriuresis using the SIPN model. A cohort of 102 normotensive black adolescents (mean age: 17.0 ± 1.2 y; 56% females) were placed on a controlled sodium (4000 ± 200 mg/d) and potassium (2600 ± 200 mg/d) diet for three days before testing. The SIPN protocol consisted of a 1-h baseline period, a 1-h stress period (competitive video game), and a 1-h recovery period. During the stress period, BP elevation was coupled with an increase in UNaV. Urinary prostasin concentration had more than a 2-fold reduction from baseline (38.4 ± 32.7 ng/mL) to stress (17.2 ± 16.0 ng/mL), and further declined during recovery (12.1 ± 16.2 ng/mL) (p < 0.001). Urinary prostasin was inversely correlated with UNaV during stress (r = -0.43, p = 0.0001), even after being normalized by urinary creatinine.

VR distraction led to significant increases in pain threshold and pain tolerance and significant decreases in pain intensity, time spent thinking about pain, and self-reported anxiety, relative to baseline. Repeated exposure did not appear to affect the benefits of VR. Implications for the long-term use of VR distraction as a nonpharmacological analgesic are discussed.

Violent content added little unique variance in accounting for these outcomes and was also largely unrelated to need satisfactions.

Medial frontal oscillatory characteristics during decision making remain largely unknown. Here, we examined oscillatory activity of the human medial frontal cortex recorded while subjects played a competitive decision-making game. Distinct patterns of power and cross-trial phase coherence in multiple frequency bands were observed during different decision-related processes (e.g., feedback anticipation vs. feedback processing). Decision and feedback processing were accompanied by a broadband increase in cross-trial phase coherence at around 220 msec, and dynamic fluctuations in power. Feedback anticipation was accompanied by a shift in the power spectrum from relatively lower (delta and theta) to higher (alpha and beta) power. Power and cross-trial phase coherence were greater following losses compared to wins in theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands, but were greater following wins compared to losses in the delta band. Finally, we found that oscillation power in alpha and beta frequency bands were synchronized with the phase of delta and theta oscillations (''phase-amplitude coupling''). This synchronization differed between losses and wins, suggesting that phase-amplitude coupling might reflect a mechanism of feedback valence coding in the medial frontal cortex.

Subjects and Methods: In total, 19 boys, 12-15 years of age, played television games on two occasions in their homes and participated once without gaming. Heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV) and physical activity were measured during gaming/participating and the night to follow using a portable combined heart rate and movement sensor. A sleep diary and questionnaires about gaming experiences and session-specific experiences were filled in. Criteria for Selection of Games: Violent game involves/rewards direct physical violence (no handguns) against another person, and nonviolent game involves/rewards no violence; same game design ('third-person game'); conducted in the same manner; no differences concerning motor activity; similar sound and light effects; no sexual content, violence against women or racial overtones. Results: During violent (vs. nonviolent) gaming, there was significantly higher activity of the very low frequency component of the HRV and total power. During the night after playing, very low frequency, low frequency and high frequency components were significantly higher during the violent (vs. nonviolent) condition, just as total power. There were no significant differences between the three conditions (violent/nonviolent/no gaming) with respect to an index reflecting subjectively perceived sleep difficulties. Nor was there any difference between violent and nonviolent condition for any single sleep item. Conclusion: Violent gaming induces different autonomic responses in boys compared to nonviolent gaming - during playing and during the following night - suggesting different emotional responses. Subjectively perceived sleep quality is not influenced after a single gaming experience.

A Grounded Theory analysis of the interviews reveals two distinct motivations (to achieve and to relax) with which gamers approach such games, together with two corresponding movement control strategies. Four movement-specific items are found to influence immersion in movement-based interaction: natural control, mimicry of movements, proprioceptive feedback, and physical challenge. These results are verified by exploiting the movement patterns of gamers playing the Nintendo Wii Boxing game. This theory offers insights to game designers as to how to design future generations of movement-based games.

Participants chose their preferred reward for a correct answer prior to seeing each question. They could either receive a single point or toss an animated coin to receive 2 points for heads or none for tails.

During eight official games the following measurements were performed on eight elite water polo goalkeepers: (1) video analysis of activities, (2) monitoring of blood lactate (BLa) and (3) continuous recording of heart rate (HR) responses. Mean HR of total mixed playing time, excluding breaks among quarters, was 134.3 ± 20.3 bpm for 36 (4 × 9) min of game duration. The large portion of the game (85.6%) was performed with a HR lower than 151.4 ± 2.7 bpm (82.1 ± 1.4% of HRpeak) an intensity corresponding to the players' anaerobic threshold (3.49 ± 0.60 mmol L-1). However, an important part of the game (14.4%) contained activities with sudden HR increases above the anaerobic threshold. Mean BLa accumulation at the end of each game period was 3.93 ± 1.64 mmol L-1. Individual lactate values varied from 2.0 to 8.3 mmol L-1. Goalkeeper exercise intensity reached its peak value (152.5 ± 10.1 bpm) whenever his team competed with one player less due to player exclusion. No significant differences were found in HR, BLa and the percentage of time spent in each of the activity categories between game periods. In conclusion, goalkeeper's game can be described as of intermittent nature with great variability in the intensity performed. The greater part of the game is associated with a low aerobic demand while an important part of the game contains activities with sudden HR increases above the anaerobic threshold implying also a considerable demand on anaerobic metabolism.

In computer games, for example, poor interaction with game characters can drastically detract from the gaming experience, making the design of autonomous synthetic characters an important issue. In particular, in Role Playing Games (RPGs), for example, users and autonomous characters often perform in a group. Usually, the role of such characters is very limited since they lack the social skills to perform coherently in group scenarios. The goal of the work presented here is to endow autonomous synthetic characters with social skills that allow them to perform in groups with human members. However, to successfully achieve this, it is not enough to assure that the characters behave in a coherent manner from an individual perspective or that they are able to perform the group task optimally. It is also necessary that the autonomous characters exhibit behaviours that are coherent with the group's composition, context and structure. For this reason, we have developed a model to support group dynamics of autonomous synthetic characters (SGD model) inspired by theories developed in human social psychological sciences. This model defines the knowledge that each individual should build about the others and the group, and how this knowledge drives their interactions. The model was used in a collaborative computer game that was tested with users. The results showed that the model had a positive effect on the users' social engagement, namely, on their trust and identification with the group. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In such P2P networks, the shared resources are the peers' contributed content and their upload bandwidth. While sharing resources, autonomous and self-interested peers need to make decisions on the amount of their resource reciprocation (i.e., representing their actions) such that their individual utilities are maximized. We model the resource reciprocation among the peers as a stochastic game and show how the peers can determine optimal strategies for resource reciprocation using a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework. Unlike existing resource reciprocation strategies, which focus on myopic decisions of peers, the optimal strategies determined based on MDP enable the peers to make foresighted decisions about resource reciprocation, such that they can explicitly consider both their immediate as well as future expected utilities. To successfully formulate the MDP framework, we propose a novel algorithm that identifies the state transition probabilities using representative resource reciprocation models of peers. These models express the peers' different attitudes toward resource reciprocation. We analytically investigate how the error between the true and estimated state transition probability impacts each peer's decisions for selecting its actions as well as the resulting utilities. Moreover, we also analytically study how bounded rationality (e.g., limited memory for reciprocation history and the limited number of state descriptions) can impact the interactions among the peers and the resulting resource reciprocation. Simulation results show that the proposed approach based on reciprocation models can effectively cope with a dynamically changing environment such as peers' joining or leaving P2P networks. Moreover, we show that the proposed foresighted decisions lead to the best performance in terms of the cumulative expected utilities. © 1999-2012 IEEE.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-67149147221

However, several obstacles remain to be overcome in designing paradigms to broadly improve quality of life. Arguably, the most notable impediment to this goal is that learning tends to be quite specific to the trained regimen and does not transfer to even qualitatively similar tasks. This severely limits the potential benefits of learning to daily life. This review discusses training regimens that lead to the acquisition of new knowledge and strategies that can be used flexibly across a range of tasks and contexts. Possible characteristics of training regimens are proposed that may be responsible for augmented learning, including the manner in which task difficulty is progressed, the motivational state of the learner, and the type of feedback the training provides.

A number of fan geometries have been investigated where both the inlet and exit rotor angles are varied relative to the heat conducting fins on a heat sink. The ratio of the fan diameter to the heat sink fin length was also varied. The objective was to determine the optimal solution from a thermal management perspective within the defined constraints. The results show a good thermal performance and highlight the need to develop the heat sink and fan as an integrated thermal solution rather than in isolation as is the traditional methodology. An interesting finding is that the heat transfer scales are in line with turbulent rather than laminar correlations despite the low Reynolds number. It is also found that while increasing the pumping power generally improves the thermal performance, only small gains are achieved for relatively large pumping power increases.

The challenge posed by modern technologies is central to her argument. Computers routinely produce ""copies"" of program code and data in use. Litman suggests that use-distinguished as commercial or noncommercial- would be a better way of organizing copyright legislation. But use is a complex and nuanced term, especially when applied to one ubiquitous reproductive technology, photography. Photography can be described as a group of technologies with multiple uses. Reproduction, in the sense of making copies, is only one aspect. For the average snapshooter, a photograph of a relative is not used to ""copy"" them, but rather to depict a likeness as a trigger for memories. Industrial uses of photography are different. Large-scale integrated circuits are fabricated using photographic technologies. Dark and light areas in a negative detect if a resistant mask should be deposited; the negative presents a mapped description of circuit pathways. Much like the copies found in computer program code, reproduction occurs without recognizable depiction. The photographic functions of reproduction, depiction, and detection are separate (Maynard, Engine and ""Talbot's Techonologies""). I agree with Litman's contention that the term copy has lost its utility, not merely because of digital technology, but because of technology in the broadest sense. Distinguishing between description and depiction differentiates between the ""copies"" computers use and copies as reproductions. The transitory ""copies"" of data present in digital technology are sets of instructions describing a tangible or ephemeral object-music, pictures, and words. Like the photographic negatives used to manufacture integrated circuits or circuit boards, the copied data tells machines how to reproduce objects. It neither depicts, nor reproduces them. These subtle distinctions are present in U.S. copyright law, but only in regard to architecture. Descriptions of buildings, in the form of plans, can be copyrighted.1 However, 17 U.S.C. §120(a) provides for a right of depiction: (a) Pictorial Representations Permitted.-The copyright in an architectural work that has been constructed does not include the right to prevent the making, distributing, or public display of pictures, paintings, photographs, or other pictorial representations of the work, if the building in which the work is embodied is located in or ordinarily visible from a public place. This right only extends to architecture; no other category in copyright law offers similar exclusions. The statute uses the term ""representation"" rather than depiction and only concerns pictorial representations. Nonetheless, U.S.C. 17 §120(a) differentiates between representation and reproduction and classifies photography among representative technologies. Photography's depictive power is often conflated with the descriptiveness of its reproductions. Its ability to describe physical objects into twodimensional projections is unparalleled. Photographs ""tell"" us things about the subject, but also provide raw material for imagination. A photograph is not a ""copy"" of its subject. I am sympathetic to Kendall L. Walton's controversial assertion that depictive photographs are essentially fictions facilitating imagination. ""To be a depiction is to have the function of serving as a prop in visual games of make believe"" (Walton, Mimesis 296). A depiction does more than ""copy"" reality. Nonetheless, because of the power of its descriptions, photography is more suspect than painting or sketching. A person sketching a public landmark is less likely to be interrogated than a person with a camera. The right to photograph in public does not exist by statute, except in the case of architecture. Following a 2005 controversy regarding Anish Kapoor's sculpture Cloud Gate, this chapter revisits the concept of reproducibility in art. Kapoor's sculpture captured the imagination of Internet users who warned of a new prohibition of photography taking hold. Though Walter Benjamin's ""The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction"" loses some of its prophetic luster in the aftermath of Cloud Gate, most of the mechanisms involved remain relevant. As a monument to capitalism and a ""copyrightable"" property, the sculpture provides a locus for discussing the right to photograph in public spaces and the use of media, both new and old. © 2008 by University of Michigan Press.

We developed high-level controllers in Readylog for our soccer robots in RoboCup's Middle-size league, but also for service robots and for autonomous agents in interactive computer games. For a successful deployment of Readylog on a real robot it is also important to account for the control problem as a whole, integrating the low-level control of the robot (such as localization, navigation, and object recognition) with the logic-based high-level control.

In Study 2, the moderating and mediating role of immersion was also tested. Results showed that video game violence exposure was related to aggressive cognitions and state of hostility. Video game technology did not moderate this relationship. Finally, immersion, as an individual difference variable, did not moderate or mediate this relationship.

Hence we consider fundamental that virtual humans or other characters present convincing and expressive gaze in applications such as Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs), games and movies. However, we perceive that in many applications that require automatic generation of facial movements, such as ECA, character's eye motion does not carry meaning related to its expressiveness. This work proposes a model for the automatic generation of expressive gaze by examining eye behavior in different affective states. To collect data related to gaze and expressiveness, we looked at Computer Graphics movies. This data was used as a basis to describe gaze expressions in the proposed model. We also implemented a prototype and performed some tests with users in order to observe the impact of eye behavior during some expressions of emotion. The results show that the model is capable of generating eye motions that are coherent with the affective states of the virtual character. © 2008 ACM.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-56349126936

Design: Comparison study. Setting: Children's Exercise Laboratory, University of Hong Kong. Participants: Eighteen children (aged 6-12 years) recruited from local primary schools. Main Exposure: Active and seated computer games played by all participants. Main Outcome Measures: Resting energy expenditure and heart rate measured before gaming, during seated gaming, and during use of 2 active gaming formats (XaviX bowling and XaviX J-Mat; SSD Company Ltd, Shiga, Japan). We used repeated-measures analyses of variance to compare the outcome measures. Results: The energy expenditure was significantly higher during seated gaming (mean [SD], 1.31 [0.19] kcal/ min-1; P&lt;.001), XaviX bowling (1.89 [0.45] kcal/min-1; P&lt;.001), and XaviX J-Mat gaming (5.23 [1.63] kcal/ min-1; P&lt;.001) compared with rest. The energy expended above rest was significantly higher for the 2 active gaming formats (P&lt;.001 for both) compared with seated gaming. The heart rate was significantly higher during XaviX bowling (mean [SD, ]102 [20] beats/min-1; P&lt;.001) and XaviX J-Mat gaming (160 [20] beats/ min-1; P&lt;.001) compared with rest. Heart rate during the XaviX J-Mat gaming was significantly higher than during seated gaming (P&lt;.001).

The participants - 148 undergraduate students - were randomly assigned to four treatment conditions: two groups played a violent computer game (Unreal Tournament), and the other two a non-violent game (Motocross Madness), half with a VR device and the remaining participants on the computer screen. In order to assess the game effects the following instruments were used: a BIOPAC System MP100 to measure HR, an Emotional Stroop task to analyze the priming of aggressive and fear thoughts, a self-report State Hostility Scale to measure hostility, and a competitive reaction-time task to assess aggressive behavior.

The Iowa gambling task (IGT) was designed to verify the SMH. However, more and more behavioral and brain imaging studies had reported incongruent results that pinpointed a need to re-evaluate the central representations of SMH. The current study used event-related fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) to examine neural correlates of anticipation vs. outcome, wins vs. losses, and differential decks' contingencies of IGT. Results: Behavioral results showed a prominent effect of frequency in driving choices. The insula and basal ganglia were activated during the anticipation phase while the inferior parietal lobule was activated during the outcome phase. The activation of medial prefrontal cortex was especially targeted during the high punishment contingencies. The data suggest that under uncertainty the normal decision makers can become myopic. Conclusion: The insula and basal ganglia might play a vital role in long-term guidance of decision-making. Inferior parietal lobule might participate in evaluating the consequence and medial prefrontal cortex may service the function of error monitoring. © 2008 Lin et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",18655719,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-50149083061

Using a computer-mediated coalition game we show that communicating anger is a risky strategy in multiparty bargaining. The main findings of three studies were that participants: (1) form negative impressions of players who communicate anger and therefore (2) exclude such players from coalitions and from obtaining a payoff share, but (3) make considerable concessions on those rare occasions that they choose to form a coalition with an angry player, or (4) when they had to form a coalition with an angry player.

The aim of this study was to investigate the acute effects of 13 mg and 17 mg Δ 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on skills important for coordinated movement and driving and on subjective and autonomic measures in regular users of marijuana. Fourteen regular users of marijuana were enrolled. Each subject was tested on two separate days. On each test day, subjects smoked two low-nicotine cigarettes, one with and the other without THC. Seventeen mg THC was included in the cigarette on one test day and 13 mg on the other day. The sequence of cigarette types was unknown to the subject. During smoking, heart rate and blood pressure were monitored, and the subjects performed a virtual reality maze task requiring attention and motor coordination, followed by 3 other cognitive tasks (Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), a ""gambling"" task and estimation of time and distance from an approaching car). After smoking a cigarette with 17 mg THC, regular marijuana users hit the walls more often on the virtual maze task than after smoking cigarettes without THC; this effect was not seen in patients after they smoked cigarettes with 13 mg THC. Performance in the WCST was affected with 17 mg THC and to a lesser extent with the use of 13 mg THC. Decision making in the gambling task was affected after smoking cigarettes with 17 mg THC, but not with 13 m THC. Smoking cigarettes with 13 and 17 mg THC increased subjective ratings of pleasure and satisfaction, drug ""effect"" and drug ""high"".

Methods: The study sample included 1803 adolescents (12-19 years) from the 1999-04 US National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. Average daily screen time (combined television, computer and video game use) was self-reported. MetS was defined according to adolescent criteria linked to the adult criteria of the National Cholesterol Education Program (≥3 of high triglycerides, high fasting glucose, high waist circumference, high blood pressure and low HDL cholesterol). Results: After adjustment for relevant covariates, the odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for MetS increased in a dose-response manner (Ptrend &lt; 0.01) across ≤1 h/day (1.00, referent), 2 h/day (1.21, 0.54-2.73), 3 h/day (2.16, 0.99-4.74), 4 h/day (1.73, 0.72-4.17) and ≥5 h/day (3.07, 1.48-6.34) screen time categories.

The aim of this study was to examine the kinematical, physiological and technical load imposed on soccer players during three typical small-sided 3-a-side training games carried out in an artificial grass 33×20 m surface. Methods. Kinematic analysis was carried out with a bidimen-sional photogrammetric video system. Heart rate was recorded at 5 s intervals using Polar Accurex Plus heart rate monitors and expressed in relation to individual maximal heart rate (HRmax). Technical parameters were registered using a specifically designed notation sheet. Results. The overall intensity of these three small-sided games was superior than the experienced during competitive matches. Distance covered (747-749 vs 638 m) and mean heart rate (173 vs 166 b·min-1) were higher (P&lt;0.05) in the drills without goalkeepers. The inclusion of goalkeepers reduced the tempo of the game as players performed less (P&lt;0.05) high-intensity running and increased (P&lt;0.05) low-intensity activities. Time spent exercising at intensities between 76-85 % HRmax was lower (P&lt;0.05) in the game without goals, whereas the presence of goalkeepers reduced (P&lt;0.05) activities performed exceeding 86% HRmax. Conclusion. The results of this study suggest that small-sided games can be used effectively to develop the specific endurance capacity of football players.

In this paper, we address cooperation stimulation in realistic yet challenging contexts where the environment is noisy and the underlying monitoring is imperfect. We have first explored the underlying reasons why stimulating cooperation under such scenarios is difficult. Instead of trying to enforce all nodes to act fully cooperatively, our goal is to stimulate cooperation in a hostile environment as much as possible through playing conditional altruism. To formally address the problem, we have modeled the interactions among nodes as secure routing and packet forwarding games under noise and imperfect observation, and devised a set of reputation-based attack-resistant cooperation strategies without requiring any tamper-proof hardware or central banking service. The performance of the devised strategies has also been evaluated analytically. The limitations of the game-theoretic approaches and the practicability of the devised strategies have also been investigated through theoretical analysis and extensive simulation studies. The results have demonstrated that although sometimes a gap may exist between the ideal game model and the reality, game-theoretic analysis can still provide thoughtful insights and useful guidelines when designing cooperation strategies. © 2008 IEEE.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-44049100110

These entities may be computer software, robots, and also humans. In fact, many multi-agent systems are intended to operate in cooperation with or as a service for humans. Typically, multi-agent systems are designed assuming perfectly rational, self-interested agents, according to the principles of classical game theory. Recently, such strong assumptions have been relaxed in various ways. One such way is explicitly including principles derived from human behavior. For instance, research in the field of behavioral economics shows that humans are not purely self-interested. In addition, they strongly care about fairness. Therefore, multi-agent systems that fail to take fairness into account, may not be sufficiently aligned with human expectations and may not reach intended goals. In this paper, we present an overview of work in the area of fairness in multi-agent systems. More precisely, we first look at the classical agent model, that is, rational decision making. We then provide an outline of descriptive models of fairness, that is, models that explain how and why humans reach fair decisions.

Textile-based sensors can be woven or knitted into an item of clothing and wom next to the skin. Information picked up can be sent to an electronic device where it can be recorded or displayed and used to provide the wearer with bio-feedback. Wearable health monitoring systems were originally developed to monitor the health of astronauts, and then transmit information to control stations on earth. More recently, they have been used in the medical sector to monitor patients, including those recovering from operations away from hospital. One company at the foreftont of wearable health monitoring is USA-based Textronics. The company has four product families: Textro-Sensors or conductive fabric electrodes and motion sensors; Textro Interconnect laminate wiring cable; Textro Yarn elastic conductive fibre; and Textro Polymer variable resistive polymer. Its first product was the NuMetrex branded sports bra Since then it has added the NuMetrex Cardio Shirt for men and the NuMetrex Racer Tank for women. More recently, it has launched Heart Smart apparel to enable it to expand from the sports to the health market. Target customers will include those focusing on weight loss and hearl health. It has also launched a developer's kit containing all the parts needed to make a wearable health monitoring system. The kit includes textile sensors - approved by the USA-based Food and Drug Administration (FDA) - as an alternative to the adhesive electrodes and metal wristbands commonly used with electrocardiograph (ECG) instruments. Forecasts from Venture Development Corporation (VDC) suggest that sales of smart fabrics and interactive textiles (SFIT) for sensing and monitoring will grow by 49.3% a year between 2006 and 2010. NPD Group has predicted that interactive apparel is likely to become a billion dollar business before long. Promising applications include fitness, corporate wellness, lifestyle health, medical health care, facilitation of independent living by the elderly, military uses and sports. Futuristic ideas include clothing which is capable of reading a person's emotional state for use in computer games. Another concept is that of ""tele health"", whereby patients would be diagnosed and treated without having to visit a doctor. Overall, the outlook for wearable textile-based health monitoring systems is positive. But to gain mass acceptance by consumers, devices need to be comfortable, easy to carefor, reliable, easy to use, and inexpensive. © Textiles Intelligence Limited 2008.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-53249117575

Specifically, we show the efficacy of such objective measurements as heart rate variability (HRV), and pupillary response in evaluating user cost in game environments, along with subjective techniques, and investigate eye and hand behavior at various levels of user cost. In addition, a method for evaluating task performance at the micro-level is developed by combining eye and hand data. Four findings indicate the great potential value of combining multiple data sources to evaluate interaction: first, spectral analysis of HRV in the low frequency band shows significant sensitivity to changes in user cost, modulated by game difficulty-the result is consistent with subjective ratings, but pupillary response fails to accord with user cost in this game environment; second, eye saccades seem to be more sensitive to user cost changes than eye fixation number and duration, or scanpath length; third, a composite index based on eye and hand movements is developed, and it shows more sensitivity to user cost changes than a single eye or hand measurement; finally, timeline analysis of the ratio of eye fixations to mouse clicks demonstrates task performance changes and learning effects over time.

In a goal of urban traffic simulation, we must consider the dynamic interactions between autonomous vehicles. The field of multi-agent systems provides us some studies for such systems, in particular on the coordination mechanisms. Conflicts between vehicles (i.e. agents) are very frequent in such applications, and they may cause deadlocks, particularly at intersections such as crossroads. Our approach is based on the solving of two player games/decision matrices which characterize three basic situations. An aggregation method generalizes to n-player games for complex crossroads. The objective of this approach consists in searching basic two-player matrices for solving n-agent problems. To explain the principle, we describe our approach for a particular case of crossroad with three agents. Finally, the obtained results have been examined via a tool of road traffic simulation, ARCHISIM.

This effect is supported by the interactions between users and synthetic characters perform together, which are often in group scenarios. However, for these group interactions to be successful, it is not enough to assure that the characters behave in a coherent manner from an individual perspective, but it is also necessary that they exhibit behaviours that are coherent with the group's composition, context and structure. Therefore, we have developed a model to support group dynamics of autonomous synthetic characters (SGD Model), inspired in theories developed in human social psychological sciences, that define the knowledge that each individual should build about the others and the group, and how this knowledge drives their interactions. This model was used to drive the behaviour of characters in a collaborative computer game that was used in an experiment that showed that the SGD Model had a positive effect on the users' social engagement, namely on their trust and identification with the group. © 2008 - IOS Press and the authors.

Eight rugby league players underwent a standardized one-on-one tackling drill in a 10-m grid. Players performed the one-on-one tackling drill before strenuous exercise and following game-specific repeated-effort exercise of progressively increasing intensities (corresponding to moderate, heavy, and very heavy intensity) in order to induce fatigue that was representative of match conditions. Video footage was taken from the rear, side, and front of the defending player. Tackling technique was objectively assessed using standardized technical criteria. In addition, all players underwent measurements of standard anthropometry (height, body mass, and sum of 7 skinfold measurements), speed (10-, 20-, and 40-m sprint), muscular power (vertical jump), agility (L run), and estimated maximal aerobic power (V̇o2max multistage fitness test). A progressive increase in total repeated-effort time, heart rate, blood lactate concentration, and ratings of perceived exertion occurred throughout the repeated-effort protocol, demonstrating a progressive increase in intensity and fatigue. Fatigue resulted in progressive reductions in tackling technique. Players with the best tackling technique in a nonfatigued state demonstrated the greatest decrement in tackling technique under fatigued conditions. In addition, a significant association was observed between estimated V̇o 2max (r= -0.62) and agility (r= 0.68) and fatigue-induced decrements in tackling technique. From a practical perspective, these findings suggest that strength and conditioning programs designed to develop endurance, change of direction speed, and anticipation skills may reduce fatigue-induced decrements in tackling technique.

The work here differs from other dynamic scheduling research in two areas: (1) a more generic and realistic manufacturing model with multiple product types, multiple/parallel multi-purpose machines with sequence-dependent setup constraints, and various dynamic disturbances is used, (2) ACI integrated with both machine agents and job agents to solve not only the task allocation problem, but also the task sequencing problem.

Here we investigate the neural response to non-reciprocation of cooperation by imaging human subjects with fMRI as they play an iterated Prisoner's dilemma game with two assumed human partners. Unreciprocated cooperation was associated with greater activity in bilateral anterior insula, left hippocampus and left lingual gyrus, compared with reciprocated cooperation.

Finally, functional connectivity between anterior insula and lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in response to unreciprocated cooperation predicted subsequent defection.

Nevertheless, video games may have the potential to actually enhance children's physical activity. Objective: To explore the potential of video games to contribute to children's health and physical activity. Study Group: Twelve British children (seven female, five male) aged 8-11 years. Methods'. Th children participated in daily video-game play during school lunch times for one week. Focus group interviews were employed, pre and post the game play week, to examine children's perceptions of video games in relation to physical activity and health. Physical activity was assessed during all game play periods using pedometry and heart rate monitoring. Results: Pre the game play period, all children reported that video games had a negative impact on health and physical activity. Post game play, children reported that active video gameplay was an attractive alternative to traditional forms of physical activity that might be more attractive to nonexercisers. The results during the gameplay period revealed that boys and girls accumulated 10% and 11% of the recommended number of steps/day for health and also engaged in an average of 11 minutes (or 46% of the monitoring period) sustained moderate to vigorous physical activity through active video gaming each day. Conclusions: Although video games have traditionally been regarded as a negative influence on children's physical activity, active video games may provide a viable alternative to traditional physical activity. Even a short duration of daily active video-game play can contribute significantly to children achieving the recommended daily volume of physical activity. © 2011, Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co.

This has been picked up by human-computer interaction researchers in the so-called third wave of HCI, a movement that aims to design for experiences involving users emotionally, bodily, and providing for aesthetic experiences. We suggest that learning technologies could pick up on some of the results from the third wave of HCI, placing body and emotion more centrally into the communication and construction of knowledge. Designing for bodily interaction, emotional communication, or aesthetics is not trivial. In design work, a designer can only set the stage for certain experiences to happen, but in the end, it is the user who coconstructs the experience with or through the interaction. Based on our experiences of designing for bodily and emotional communication with others and with yourself, we will posit three postulates that might be helpful in designing for involving interaction: leaving 'surfaces' open for users to appropriate, building for users to recognize themselves socially, emotional or bodily through the interface, and avoiding reductionism. We also briefly discuss how bodily experiences may be of relevance to learning technologies. © 2008 IEEE",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953103873

Understanding why users personalise could help design personalisation features so that they promote the acceptance and adoption of information and communication technology (ICT). This paper examines the psychological underpinnings of users' willingness to expend effort to personalise ICT. The important role of the basic need of self-determination [Deci, E.L., Ryan, R.M., 2000. The""what"" and ""why"" of goal pursuits: Human needs and the self-determination of behaviour. Psychological Inquiry 11, 227-268] is argued for. Personalisation features can align the psychological resources with the user's action and therefore enhance performance and enjoyment of use. First, they can promote autonomy and the sense of being an origin and therefore transform technology to 'my technology.' Second, personalisation features can support competence by increasing the effectiveness of user's actions. At its best, personalisation becomes rewarding activity in itself regardless of the achieved effects, for example when personalisable features participate in flow experiences. Third, through its appearance functions, technology can support the basic need of relatedness through expression of emotion and identity, ego-involvement, and territory marking. Several positive effects can be identified: engagement, performance, persistence, identity, social acceptance, and social status. The paper concludes by discussing implications to design. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-37249076445

In particular lossy compression has been used in image compression (jpeg) audio compression (mp3) and video compression (mpg) to allow the transmission of audio and video over broadband network connections. Recently the sense of touch or haptics is becoming more important with its addition in computer games or in cruder applications such as vibrations in a cell phone. As haptic technology improves the ability to transmit compressed force sensations becomes more critical. Most lossy audio and visual compression techniques rely on the lack of sensitivity in humans to pick up detailed information in certain scenarios. Similarly limitations in the sensitivity of human touch could be exploited to create haptic models with much less detail and thus requiring smaller bandwidth. The focus of this paper is on the force thresholds of the human haptic system that can be used in a psychophysically motivated lossy haptic (force) compression technique. Most of the research in this field has measured the just noticeable difference (JND) of the human haptic system with a human user in static interaction with a stationary rigid object. In this paper our focus involves cases where the human user or the object are in relative motion. An example of such an application would be the haptic rendering of the user's hand in contact with of a high-viscous material or interacting with a highly deformable object. Thus an approach is presented to measure the force threshold based on the velocity of the user's hand motion. Two experiments are conducted to detect the absolute force threshold (AFT) of the human haptic system using methodologies from the field of psychophysics. The AFTs are detected for three different ranges of velocity of the user's hand motion. This study implies that when a user's hand is in motion fewer haptic details are required to be stored calculated or transmitted. Finally the implications of this study on a more complete future study will be discussed. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-36849066227

Agent teaming is a key research area of multi-agent systems that is mainly composed of artificial intelligence and distributed computing techniques. The reasoning and learning ability of agents in uncertain environments via communication and collaboration (in both competitive and cooperative situations) is another key feature for autonomous agents. Many theoretical and applied techniques have been applied to the investigation of autonomous agents with respect to coordination, cooperation, and learning abilities. Due to the inherent complexity of real-time, stochastic, and dynamic environments, it is often extremely complex and difficult to formally verify their properties a priori. In addition, it is quite difficult to generate enough episodes via real applications for training the goal-oriented agent’s individual and cooperative learning abilities. In most cases, such abilities can be obtained via computer simulation, rather than directly from real applications. In doing so, a simulation testbed is applied to test the learning algorithms in the specified scenarios. The objective of this paper is to improve the convergence and efficiency of reinforcement learning algorithms for large, continuous state-action spaces, by finding the optimal values of the parameters for those algorithms. In this paper, the game of soccer is adopted as the simulation environment in conjunction with optimisation techniques to verify goal-oriented agents’ competitive and cooperative learning abilities for decision making. We use the Sarsa learning algorithm with a linear function approximation technique known as tile coding to avoid the state space growing exponentially.

Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) measurements showed that the manipulation was successful in elevating autonomic arousal. The results showed differences in behavioral response to the manipulation based on prior experience with gambling problems. Persons with many gambling problems had lower average bet-sizes in the white-noise condition compared to the control, while those with few or no problems had higher average bet-sizes.

The melody reminds us that he was created like a child and sung to by a creator who must have deployed the song as, on the one hand, a recording test and, on the other, a nurturing lullaby. It is a moment that asks us to consider our parental responsibilities and changing relationships to the beings we create, whether organic or machine. In fact, the film asks us to consider the fine line between machine and organic creations through lyrical scenes in which the human characters wear and depend upon various technologies to eat, breathe, and move. The technological child is one that human beings create again and again, only to regard it with horror as it seizes the tools of the father and rises to power in a classic Promethean or Frankenstein plot. Suspicion of the technologies we spawn has become a folklore plotline in itself. A recent spoof of 2001 in the children's cartoon Recess (ABC/UPN, 1999-present) reveals that both parents and children are expected to identify with aspects of this story (""Schoolworld"" episode). This plot has become a parable that seeks to teach parents and children to consider the mysteries of creationism and child development. But it also regards these mysteries with suspicion, asking us to consider the relationship between children and technology. Are our technological creations offspring that we shun because they threaten our authority and bring about our obsolescence? These questions are overtly addressed at the end of the introduction to AI: Artificial Intelligence (2001), adapted from Brian Aldiss's 1969 story ""Super-Toys Last All Summer Long."" In AI, David (Haley Joel Osment) is a cyberchild, programmed to love its parents but then rejected by them. The film posits the idea that, while we can create a simulated child with emotions and consciousness, it is much more difficult to find parents who can return a child's love and raise him or her with a proper sense of ethics, responsibility, and morality. The technological child evokes our sibling rivalry; once we recognize its independence as a created being, we seek to disconnect it. AI depicts the sibling rivalry between two children, one cyborg and created to love unconditionally, the other an organic child who looks partially cyborg due to assistive devices for walking. Who is the monster in this film? The father/programmer, the computer, or the human sibling, a symbol of the peer community that fears it? Frankenstein's creature, HAL, and Spielberg's artificial child are Adams of our genesis impulse. They are born in innocence and tragically engineered by environment to act in particularly monstrous ways. What does it mean to develop as a human being, these films ask? How have technological creations come to stand for our sentiments about universal patterns of child development, today's computer-aged children, and our own flaws as a parenting culture? It is perhaps not surprising that the dawn of the computer age features science-fiction films with the Frankenstein theme of a child surpassing the powers of the creator, who, like the divine being of Genesis, built it from clay, simulated flesh, or wires and electricity. The theme of development from tabula rasa to monster or outcast explains the genre's popularity with family audiences, particularly teenagers. In many films, machines simultaneously replace or threaten youth and mirror the concerns of both young people and their parents regarding human development. For example, in Disney's The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes (1969), a student, Dexter (Kurt Russell), merges with a computer and becomes intellectually gifted but forgets basic human values such as friendship. In Tron (1982), another Disney film, we encounter the cosmic battle between a corporate father figure and his progeny, both a computer that displaces its creator and a hacker whom the father has dispossessed because of the hacker's gaming skill. In WarGames (1983), a teen hacker is asked to develop a relationship with and reform a computer system that was created as a child substitute but has become monstrous and needs to recall the innocent play of early childhood. The restoration of a proper childhood is echoed in Terminator 2 (1991) and Warner Brothers' animated feature The Iron Giant (1999), both of which represent the computerized machine as a reprogrammable child that only needs the touch of a real child to learn how to play, feel, and respect life.1 Perhaps the most childlike cyborg of all is Data (Brent Spiner) of Star Trek's The Next Generation (syndication, 1987-1994). In Star Trek: Insurrection (1998), Data obtains lessons from a real child in how to play, something that these films feel is necessary to aid wholesome growth and human understanding. AI is only the logical culmination of the genre's testing ground for what makes a child-creature human and how we can resolve our conflicted feelings toward child development in the computer age, which seems to have robbed children of innocence and allowed them to surpass adults in skill, power, and authority. The theme of childlike machines and machinelike children is pervasive enough to justify what Mikel J. Koven calls a ""motif spotting"" methodology (2003, 183), the enumeration of traditional folklore motifs in what I see as the dynamic, modern storytelling of popular film. While the relation of film to traditional folk storytelling is a question for folklorists, as a children's literature critic, I feel that an analysis of pervasive motifs across cinematic and literary texts can illuminate ambiguities (particularly toward children) localized in our collective, cultural unconscious. In my view, the films that I discuss are coming-of-age tales that endlessly replay the power of the transformation folktale to capture our Western view of child development. Computer characters grow from a state of puppetry, given genesis but not freedom, to adulthood, which means determining their own destiny and understanding the meanings and responsibilities of being human-but not without growing pains that are experienced as monstrous. These science fiction films appropriate the traditional folkloric motifs of magical transformation (D0-D499), magic objects (D800-D1699), and creation of man (A1200-A1299) through the motif of inanimate objects coming to life. These narrative elements are common to folk-based stories of child development that have become staples of children's literature in such stories as Carlo Collodi's The Adventures of Pinocchio ([1881] 1996) and Margery Williams's The Velveteen Rabbit ([1922] 1958). As animals and folk heroes have traditionally functioned, toys are simultaneously child characters and more than children. They stand for children when they embark on journeys to understand their relationship to their creators and develop their own sense of consciousness and agency; characters undergo metamorphosis when they have explored and mastered what it means to be human.2 A tough adolescence typically intervenes in this quest for mastery. Science-fiction films have adopted the toy-folklore combination to express similar themes with computer progeny. While computer ""children"" function as folk heroes, exploring human development in the universal sense described by Donna Rosenberg (1997) in her collection of folktales for children, they also express our wonder at and fear of today's computer-age children, who threaten adults with obsolescence. © 2007 by Utah State University Press.

In this way it resembles the ""war-games"" of the military of ""flight simulators"" of aviation. Medical training-has always involved graduated acceptance of decision-making and supervised practice. Equally, examination have long included actors. As such, medical training has always incorporated a degree of simulation of real practice. What has changed is the explosion of available technology, the principles of adult education, the focus on patient safety, and the expectation of proof via research. Simulation is therefore a huge topic. We hope to offer a concise introduction.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-38049098229

A key feature of EMOTLAB software is its ability to control both the strategic behavior and the emotion signaling behavior (e.g., anger vs. embarrassment) of the virtual interaction partner. By simply editing a series of text files that control the subroutines governing the different features of the experiment (payoff structure, number of trials, etc.), EMOTLAB can generate an essentially infinite number of different social bargaining situations in which participants earn monetary payoffs contingent upon their decisions.

In particular, we focus on a Naval simulation system, used for training of conning officers. The currently existing training solutions require multiple expert personnel to control each vessel in a training scenario, or are cumbersome to use by a single instructor. The inability of current technology to provide an automated mechanism for competitive realistic boat behaviors thus compromises the goal of flexible, anytime, anywhere training. In this article we propose an approach that reduces the time and effort required for training of conning officers, by integrating novel approaches to autonomous control within a simulation environment. Our solution is to develop intelligent, autonomous controllers that drive the behavior of each boat. To increase the system's efficiency we provide a mechanism for creating such controllers, from the demonstration of a navigation expert, using a simple programming interface. In addition, our approach deals with two significant and related challenges: the realism of behavior exhibited by the automated boats and their real-time response to changes in the environment. In this article, we describe the control architecture we developed that enables the real-time response of boats and the repertoire of realistic behaviors we designed for this application.

We modify standard CLASS for interflow generation using a field capacity threshold together with a spatial probability distribution function to represent sub-grid variability in soil field capacity. We also introduce a linear reservoir at the bottom of the third CLASS soil layer to model the baseflow. The 1998-99 HUBEX/GAME (HUaihe river Basin EXperiment/Monsoon Asian GEWEX Experiment) IOP (Intensive Observation Period) data set is used in this study. CLASS is driven by observed atmospheric forcing in a stand-alone mode. Both standard and modified versions of CLASS are first evaluated using the observed hydrograph at the outlet of the Shiguanhe sub-basin, part of the Huaihe River Basin in China, and soil moisture measurements at three sites over the sub-basin. The two versions are further validated for their ability to simulate net radiation, sensible and latent heat fluxes, ground heat flux, and soil temperature and moisture over four measurement sites with different land covers in the Huaihe River Basin. The total runoff in the Shiguanhe sub-basin simulated by the two versions is similar to each other, and is in close agreement with the observed value. The main difference between the two versions is in the partitioning of runoff components among the surface runoff, interflow and baseflow. Modified CLASS simulates better both peak flows and flood timing. The two versions of CLASS give similar results for the net radiation, sensible and latent heat fluxes, ground heat flux, and soil temperature and moisture, which compare well with observations over the study sites. Our modification of standard CLASS thus leads to an improvement in runoff and hydrograph simulation, while preserving its existing positive features. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The results of Experiment 1 revealed that adolescent players who felt a strong sense of responsibility appeared to exhibit greater attitude change.

Two research challenges of highlight ranking are addressed, namely affective feature extraction and ranking model construction. The basic principle of affective feature extraction in our work is to extract sensitive features which can stimulate user's emotion. Since the users pay most attention to player behavior and audience response in racket sport highlights, we extract affective features from player behavior including action and trajectory, and game-specific audio keywords. We propose a novel motion analysis method to recognize the player actions. We employ support vector regression to construct the nonlinear highlight ranking model from affective features. A new subjective evaluation criterion is proposed to guide the model construction. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approaches, we have tested them on more than ten-hour broadcast tennis and badminton videos.

Self-paced operation means that the BCI is able to determine whether the ongoing brain activity is intended as control signal (intentional control) or not (non-control state). The presented system is able to automatically reduce electrooculogram (EOG) artifacts, to detect electromyographic (EMG) activity, and uses only three bipolar EEG channels. Two applications are presented: the freeSpace virtual environment (VE) and the Brainloop interface. The freeSpace is a computer-game-like application where subjects have to navigate through the environment and collect coins by autonomously selecting navigation commands. Three subjects participated in these feedback experiments and each learned to navigate through the VE and collect coins. Two out of the three succeeded in collecting all three coins.

The nature of the initial relationship remains the subject of controversy. Various conceptual models have been proposed, but none has definitive support. We construct a model of inter-species interactions based upon well-established respiratory pathways, describing the respective energy gain of host-cell and PMP resulting from varying levels of cooperation. The model demonstrates conflicting evolutionary strategies (""Prisoner's Dilemmas"") in the interspecies molecular transfers. Nevertheless, we show that coercion and iterated, multilevel selection on both species encourage endosymbiosis. Mutualism is favored if host-cells are significantly more effective than PMPs at gathering food. Otherwise, an unambiguous asymmetry between host-cell and PMP benefits implies that the initial relationship consisted of the host-cell deriving a reproductive advantage at the PMPs' expense-a cellular version of farming. Other initial relationships such as oxygen-detoxification mutualism and parasitism are not strongly supported by the model. We compare the model behavior with experiments on mutant human mitochondria and find the model predicts proliferation rates consistent with that data. We derive from the evolutionary dynamics counter-intuitive therapeutic targets for two human hereditary mitochondrial disorders that reflect the ongoing effect of short-term selection at the mitochondrial level. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous work based on this model suggests that the social context may influence this process at multiple points. The present research focuses on whether talking to others about an activity experience is one means by which individuals evaluate how interesting that activity is. In Study 1 college students completed questionnaires that asked about real life experiences where working on an activity was more interesting because they worked with others. They described experiences that occurred first in any domain, and then that occurred specifically in the school domain. Results suggested that the more students talked with others about the activity after it happened the more they reported greater interest in the activity after the conversations. In the school domain, this was especially true for Latinos and for individuals who scored higher on the Relational Self-Construal scale. Study 2 employed a lab paradigm to control for the task that individuals talked to others about and to examine whether the nature of listeners' reactions influenced the speaker's interest even after the study was ostensibly over. First, replicating Pasupathi and Rich (2005, 'Inattentive listening undermines self-verification in personal storytelling', Journal of Personality 73, pp. 1051-1086) college students who talked to a distracted friend about a computer game during the lab session reported a significant drop in interest relative to those who talked to attentive friends, regardless of whether the attentive listeners agreed or disagreed with participants. Importantly, interest ratings at a 4-6 week follow-up were affected by the perceived responsiveness of listeners during spontaneous conversational retellings outside the lab, controlling for interest levels at the end of the lab session. Taken together, results suggest that social interaction plays an important role in regulating activity interest even beyond the immediate activity experience. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-34547667065

The first important aspect of the problem is to choose the utility functions of the vehicles in such a way that the objectives of the vehicles are localized to each vehicle yet aligned with a global utility function. The second important aspect of the problem is to equip the vehicles with an appropriate negotiation mechanism by which each vehicle pursues the optimization of its own utility function. We present several design procedures and accompanying caveats for vehicle utility design. We present two new negotiation mechanisms, namely, ""generalized regret monitoring with fading memory and inertia"" and ""selective spatial adaptive play,"" and provide accompanying proofs of their convergence.

Existing resource allocation solutions for WLANs are not network-aware and do not take into account the selfish behavior of individual WSTAs. Specifically, the selfish WSTAs can manipulate the network by untruthfully representing their private information (i.e., video characteristics, experienced channel conditions, and deployed streaming strategies). This often results in inefficient resource allocations. To overcome this obstacle, we present a pricing mechanism for message exchanges between the WSTAs and the Central Spectrum Moderator (CSM). The messages represent network-aware resource demands and corresponding prices. We prove that the message exchanges reach the Nash equilibrium and that the resulting equilibrium messages generate allocations which are efficient, budget balanced, and satisfy voluntary participation. The simulation results verify that these properties hold when the WSTAs behave strategically. Additionally, we evaluate the impact of initial prices and network congestion level on the convergence rate of message exchanges. © 2007 IEEE.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-34547903610

These findings offer a first step toward elucidating the mechanisms underlying social impairment in youth with internalizing disorders. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",17340177,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-34547419673

Second, we modelled the possible mediating role of sleeping habits and waking-time tiredness in the association between ICT usage and perceived health (health complaints, musculoskeletal symptoms, health status). The participants were 7292 Finns aged 12, 14, 16 and 18 years responding to a postal enquiry (response rate 70%). The results showed that boys played digital games and used Internet more often than girls, whose mobile phone usage was more intensive. Structural equation model analyses substantiated the mediating hypothesis: intensive ICT-usage was associated with poor perceived health particularly or only when it negatively affected sleeping habits, which in turn was associated with increased waking-time tiredness. The associations were gender-specific especially among older adolescents (16- and 18-year olds). Intensive computer usage forms a risk for boys', and intensive mobile phone usage for girls' perceived health through the mediating links. Girls were vulnerable to the negative consequences of intensive mobile phone usage, as it associated with perceived health complaints and musculoskeletal symptoms both directly and through deteriorated sleep and increased waking-time tiredness. The results of gender-specific ICT usage and vulnerability are discussed as reflecting gendered psychophysiological, psychological and social developmental demands. © 2006 The Association for Professionals in Services for Adolescents.",16979753,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-34347394891

The estimation period is 1986-2000, including the period before the start of tower observation (1997) on the left bank of the Lena River. The land surface model includes three submodels: vegetation, snow cover, and soil. The model can calculate water and energy fluxes above and within the forest if meteorological data over the forest are given as input. Data used in this study are Baseline Meteorological Data in Siberia (BMDS) Version 3. This set comprises daily data of main meteorological elements. The procedure is as follows: (1) preparation of equations between routine Yakutsk data and larch tower data; (2) estimation of past meteorological data over the taiga using those equations; and (3) estimation of fluxes using the one-dimensional model. The date of leaf-out start is parameterized with soil temperature and accumulated air temperature. It corresponds to the green-up time obtained from satellite normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data. Estimated monthly deviation of net radiation, Rn, is 10 Wm-2. Its maximum is 20 Wm-2. The monthly deviation of latent heat flux, LE, is less than 12 Wm-2. Its warm season average is less than 7 Wm-2. Although the magnitude of LE is almost zero in December and January, and several Wm-2 aside from these 2 months, the sensible heat flux, H, sometimes becomes negative during the cold season. The variation of evapotranspiration is considerably smaller than that of precipitation. The evapotranspiration (E) normalized by potential evaporation (Ep), E/Ep is 0.37-04 in the warm season; it tends to be large when leaf-out starts early. The amount of evapotranspiration in the warm season can be estimated from Ep within an error of 5 mm using this relationship.

Altered behavior patterns due to impaired navigation abilities in cold environments are potential problems in lost-person situations. We investigated the separate effects of low core temperature and superficial cooling on a spatially demanding virtual navigation task. Methods: There were 12 healthy men who were passively cooled via 15°C water immersion to a core temperature of 36.0°C, then transferred to a warm (40°C) water bath to eliminate superficial shivering while completing a series of 20 virtual computer mazes. In a control condition, subjects rested in a thermoneutral (∼35°C) bath for a time-matched period before being transferred to a warm bath for testing. Superficial cooling and distraction were achieved by whole-body immersion in 35°C water for a time-matched period, followed by lower leg immersion in 10°C water for the duration of the navigational tests. Results: Mean completion time and mean error scores for the mazes were not significantly different (p > 0.05) across the core cooling (16.59 ± 11.54 s, 0.91 ± 1.86 errors), control (15.40 ± 8.85 s, 0.82 ± 1.76 errors), and superficial cooling (15.19 ± 7.80 s, 0.77 ± 1.40 errors) conditions. Discussion: Separately reducing core temperature or increasing cold sensation in the lower extremities did not influence performance on virtual computer mazes, suggesting that navigation is more resistive to cooling than other, simpler cognitive tasks. Further research is warranted to explore navigational ability at progressively lower core and skin temperatures, and in different populations.

Here, the main aim is to find the best method which is very robust and fast and requires less computational resources and memory compared to similar approaches and is precise enough for robot soccer games and technical challenges. In this work, the Reverse Monte Carlo localization (R-MCL) method is introduced. The algorithm is designed for fast, precise and robust global localization of autonomous robots in the robotic soccer domain, to overcome the uncertainties in the sensors, environment and the motion model. R-MCL is a hybrid method based on Markov localization (ML) and Monte Carlo localization (MCL), where the ML based module finds the region where the robot should be and the MCL based part predicts the geometrical location with high precision by selecting samples in this region. It is called Reverse since the MCL routine is applied in a reverse manner in this algorithm. In this work, this method is tested on a challenging data set that is used by many other researchers and compared in terms of error rate against different levels of noise, and sparsity. Additionally, the time required to recover from kidnapping and the processing time of the methods are tested and compared. According to the test results R-MCL is a considerable method against high sparsity and noise. It is preferable when its recovery from kidnapping and processing times are considered. It gives robust and fast but relatively coarse position estimations against imprecise and inadequate perceptions, and coarse action data, including regular misplacements, and false perceptions. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

One is set in the novel environment of a lunar moon colony and the other is a military combat command. The research generated from these simulations for assessing the decision effectiveness of potential leaders with different personality traits and decision styles under varying degrees of information quantity, uncertainty and complexity is summarized. Opportunities and limitations of applying current computer assisted technology to social simulations for assessing and developing leaders' decision effectiveness in turbulent environments is discussed. Design/methodology/ approach - College undergraduates and officer candidates in university ROTC programs made a series of decisions while being subjected to varying degrees of environmental turbulence in social simulations. The decision effectiveness of subjects with different personality characteristics under varying degrees of environmental turbulence was assessed through researcher observations, self-reports, and peer ratings. Findings - Social simulations are a cost effective way to assess and train leaders to make effective decisions in turbulent environments. The results of controlled experiments in social simulations have suggested that leaders with high levels of cognitive complexity and incongruity adaptation are more likely to be successful in highly turbulent environments than leaders with lower levels of incongruity adaptation ability and cognitive complexity who are more effective in more stable and structured situations. Research limitations/implications - The ease of modifying computer games renders them effective as low-cost virtual worlds that have relevance in military leadership experimentation. However, the use of computer simulations alone fails to capture the impact that relationships and emotions have on leader decision making, highlighting the continuing need for social simulations that include these interpersonal aspects of decision making. Practical implications - By participating in realistic social simulations, leaders can experiment with new decision styles without the risk of making real world mistakes that could jeopardize their own and their organization's future. The leaders who are most successful in adapting their decision style to the more complex requirements can be identified for promotion or assignment to appropriate settings. Originality/value - Both military and civilian organizations are in need of cost effective way to assess and train leaders to make effective decisions in turbulent environments. Social simulations provide a unique approach to meeting these needs and can simultaneously provide a venue for research in associated areas. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-34250859710

Nevertheless, there have been no psychophysiological investigations of the underlying mechanisms available to support the characterization of excessive computer gaming as behavioral addiction. To investigate whether excessive computer gaming parallels learning processes in development and maintenance (which are assumed to underlie drug addiction), the authors obtained a psychophysiological assessment of the (learned) emotional processing of computer game-relevant and -irrelevant cues. For this purpose, electroencephalographic recordings in excessive and casual computer game players were conducted. Significant between-group differences in event-related potentials evoked by computer game related-cues were found at parietal regions and point to an increased emotional processing of these cues in excessive pathological players compared with casual players. These results are in concordance with the suggestion that addiction is characterized and maintained through sensitization of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system along with incentive salience of specific addiction-associated cues. © 2007 American Psychological Association.",17592953,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-34548621023

Video simulations representing two casino designs (playground vs. gaming) were presented to 484 participants (241 males) varying in gambling sub-type. The playground design features a recognizable theme, elements of nature, and spaciousness; the gaming design focuses on the gambling machines in a maze-like setting with low ceilings. For low trait arousal participants, at-risk intentions were higher when environmental arousal (EA) was high (mismatch) than when low (match). For high trait arousal participants, at-risk intentions were higher when EA was high (match) than when low (mismatch). A similar pattern of results occurred for restoration but only for pleasure trait-state congruency in non-problem gamblers. For problem gamblers, the effects of trait-state congruence on restoration were restricted to those with low trait pleasure for the playground design. The effects of congruence in trait and state emotion are bounded by the positivity of the outcome (at-risk gambling intention vs. restoration), the design of the casino (playground vs. gaming), the dimension of emotion (arousal vs. pleasure), the pole of the emotion (low vs. high), and gambler subtype (problem vs. non-problem).

Each of these three studied events evoked differential EEG oscillatory changes. Picking up bananas evoked decreased theta activation on central electrodes, decreased high alpha activation on frontal electrodes, and increased beta activation on frontal electrodes. Falling off the game board evoked decreased central theta activation and increased fronto-central beta activation. Reaching the goal evoked increased theta activation on parietal electrodes, increased low alpha activation on frontal electrodes, increased high alpha activation on frontal, central, and parietal electrodes, and increased beta activation on frontal and central electrodes. It is suggested that the EEG oscillations evoked by picking up bananas reflect increased cortical activation and arousal; the oscillations evoked by falling off the edge of the game board reflect motor functions; and the oscillations evoked by reaching the goal reflect a relaxed state.

Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 87, 293-311] have observed similar valence asymmetries in the domain of attitude formation and generalization. The present research examined the possibility that the extent to which individuals display a learning bias in attitude formation is related to negative cognitive style and emotional disorder symptoms. Participants played a computer game that required learning whether novel stimuli produced positive or negative outcomes. Poorer learning was associated with more negative cognitive style, greater depression, and a tendency toward greater anxiety. Interestingly, these relations were most evident with respect to the learning of the positive stimuli, suggesting that an under-appreciation of positive objects and events may underlie vulnerability to emotional disorders.

In this study, we probed the behavioral, emotional, and neural correlates of psychopathic traits within the context of a dyadic social interaction. Methods: Thirty subjects were imaged with functional magnetic resonance imaging while playing an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma game with human confederates who were outside the scanner. Subjects also completed two self-report psychopathy questionnaires. Results: Subjects scoring higher on psychopathy, particularly males, defected more often and were less likely to continue cooperating after establishing mutual cooperation with a partner. Further, they experienced more outcomes in which their cooperation was not reciprocated (cooperate-defect outcome). After such outcomes, subjects scoring high in psychopathy showed less amygdala activation, suggesting weaker aversive conditioning to those outcomes. Compared with low-psychopathy subjects, subjects higher in psychopathy also showed weaker activation within orbitofrontal cortex when choosing to cooperate and showed weaker activation within dorsolateral prefrontal and rostral anterior cingulate cortex when choosing to defect. Conclusions: These findings suggest that whereas subjects scoring low on psychopathy have emotional biases toward cooperation that can only be overcome with effortful cognitive control, subjects scoring high on psychopathy have an opposing bias toward defection that likewise can only be overcome with cognitive effort. © 2007 Society of Biological Psychiatry.",17046722,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-34248166004

This article outlines the current situation following 10 years of research with reference to the results of the 2006 World Championship in Bremen, Germany, and discusses future challenges.

However, no research has experimentally examined violent video game effects on physiological desensitization, defined as showing less physiological arousal to violence in the real world after exposure to video game violence in the virtual world. This experiment attempts to fill this gap. Participants reported their media habits and then played one of eight violent or nonviolent video games for 20 min. Next, participants watched a 10-min videotape containing scenes of real-life violence while heart rate (HR) and galvanic skin response (GSR) were monitored. Participants who previously played a violent video game had lower HR and GSR while viewing filmed real violence, demonstrating a physiological desensitization to violence. Results are interpreted using an expanded version of the General Aggression Model. Links between desensitization, antisocial, and prosocial behavior are discussed. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Study design: A longitudinal study of 315 students (black: 23 females, 19 males; white: 142 females, 131 males) was conducted in the public schools of Obion County, Tennessee, between 1987 and 1992. BMI and BMI z scores were calculated. The CVR task was a series of video games (taking ∼10 minutes to play) given to the same students in their third-, fourth-, fifth-, seventh-, and eighth-grade years. CVR was defined as the change in blood pressure (Δ_BP) or heart rate (Δ_HR) between before playing and while playing the video game. Positive parental history of HTN (27.6%) was defined as at least 1 parent with HTN. Multivariable regression analyses were performed to estimate the effects of parental HTN on children's BMI and CVR over time. Results: Children with parental HTN had significant higher BMI, BMI z score, and R_BP than did children without parental HTN (BMI: 21.6 vs 19.9, P = .001; BMI z score: 1.6 vs 1.1, P = .003; R_SBP: 112.6 vs 110.4 mm Hg, P = .01; R_DBP 62.7 vs 60.6 mm Hg, P = .003) after adjustment for covariates. Increased CVR was observed in children with parental HTN compared with children without parental HTN but was statistically significant only for SBP (Δ_SBP: 17.2 vs 14.9 mm Hg; P = .01) after adjustment for covariates. Conclusions: Parental HTN independently predicted children's BMI, BMI z score, resting BP, and BP reactivity. © 2007 Mosby, Inc.

We first investigate a simple yet illuminating two-player packet forwarding game and derive the optimal and cheat-proof packet forwarding strategies. We then investigate the secure routing and packet forwarding game for autonomous ad hoc networks in noisy and hostile environments and derive a set of reputation-based cheat-proof and attack-resistant cooperation stimulation strategies. When analyzing the cooperation strategies, besides Nash equilibrium, other optimality criteria, such as Pareto optimality, subgame perfection, fairness, and cheat-proofing, have also been considered.

The traditional models such as statistical extrapolation or econometrics are not capable to anticipate the changes in the pattern of the market prices due to the future structural changes. Furthermore, in such free and open markets, there is a more intense need for each participant to benefit from a certain level of autonomy, while keeping some capabilities to interact, communicate, collaborate and negotiate with other participants in an efficient way. As a result, there is a need for a novel framework of modelling that could include game theoretical assumptions as well as other more complex assumptions. Agent technologies in general and agent-based simulation in particular offer this possibility. This paper proposes, in a decision-making perspective, a new multi-agent architecture specifically designed to support planning activities in decentralized electricity markets, with a certain level of flexibility. In this model, synthetic agents are created allowing flexible representations of the multi-functional market players and possible mergers and coalitions in the electricity market. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Recently, Mobile Broadband Wireless Access technology-based (MBWA) games have been introduced into the marketplace. They are superior to current mobile games in terms of transmission speed and price and to older online games that have limited mobility. Since MBWA technologies, such as High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA), Wireless Broadband (WiBro), and Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) have been developed, customers can enjoy games whenever and wherever they like. We decided to analyze the factors that influence potential users' adoption of MBWA games using an extension of TAM. Most previous game-related studies lack a comprehensive approach to both technological and psychological aspects of game adoption and do not reflect a variety of consumer preferences. We therefore extended TAM to include an emotion variable and measured the moderating effects of gender, age, and prior experience on game adoption. Overall, the results revealed that the effect of perceived enjoyment was very important but that usefulness did not influence an individual's attitude. In addition, we also find that age can be key moderator of game acceptance. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-34247896924

Fear and anticipatory anxiety before invasive procedures often lead to uncooperativeness. A novel device (PediSedate®) provides sedation through a combination of inhaled nitrous oxide and distraction (video game). We evaluated the acceptability and safety of the PediSedate® device in children. Methods: We enrolled children between 3 and 9 years old who were scheduled to undergo surgical procedures that required general inhalational anesthesia. After the device was applied, he/she played a video game while listening to the audio portion of the game through the earphones. Nitrous oxide in oxygen was administered via the nasal piece of the headset starting at 50% and increasing to 70%, in 10% increments every 8 min. Treatment failures, vital signs, arterial oxygen saturation, depth of sedation, airway patency, side effects, acceptance of the device and parental satisfaction were all evaluated. Results: Of 100 children included, treatment failure occurred in 18% mainly because of poor tolerance of the device. At least 96% of the children who completed the study exhibited an excellent degree of sedation, 22% had side effects, and none experienced serious airway obstruction. Nausea and vomiting were the most common side effects and no patients had hemodynamic instability. Conclusions: The PediSedate® device combines nonpharmacologic with pharmacologic methods of sedation.

Background: Subjective workload measures such as the Subjective Workload Assessment Technique (SWAT) and NASA Task Load Index are sensitive to single-task parameters and dual-task loads but have not attempted to measure workload in particular mental processes. An alternative is the MRQ. Method: In Experiment 1, participants completed simple laboratory tasks and the MRQ after each. Interference between tasks was then correlated to three different task similarity metrics: profile similarity, based on r2 between ratings; overlap similarity, based on summed minima; and overall demand, based on summed ratings. Experiment 2 used similar methods but more complex computer-based games. Results: In Experiment 1 the MRQ moderately predicted interference (r = +.37), with no significant difference between metrics. In Experiment 2 the metric effect was significant, with overlap similarity excelling in predicting interference (r = +.83). Mean ratings showed high diagnosticity in identifying specific mental processing bottlenecks. Conclusion: The MRQ shows considerable promise as a cognitive-process-sensitive workload measure. Application: Potential applications of the MRQ include the identification of dual-processing bottlenecks as well as process overloads in single tasks, preparatory to redesign in areas such as air traffic management, advanced flight displays, and medical imaging.

In light of these competing forces, it is surprising how efficient these networks are. An exciting challenge in the area of algorithmic game theory is to understand the success of these networks in game theoretic terms: what principles of interaction lead selfish participants to form such efficient networks? In this chapter we present a number of network formation games. We focus on simple games that have been analyzed in terms of the efficiency loss that results from selfishness. We also highlight a fundamental technique used in analyzing inefficiency in many games: the potential function method. Introduction The design and operation of many large computer networks, such as the Internet, are carried out by a large number of independent service providers (Autonomous Systems), all of whom seek to selfishly optimize the quality and cost of their own operation. Game theory provides a natural framework for modeling such selfish interests and the networks they generate. These models in turn facilitate a quantitative study of the trade-off between efficiency and stability in network formation. In this chapter, we consider a range of simple network formation games that model distinct ways in which selfish agents might create and evaluate networks. © Noam Nisan, Tim Roughgarden, Éva Tardos, Vijay V.

The primacy of the written word and the representational world built around it is, however, under debate - especially from recent insights derived from cognitive science that seeks to bring back action, intent and emotion within the core of cognitive science (Freeman and Nunez in J Consciousness Stud 6(11/12), 1999). It is being argued that other sensory experiences, apart from the visual, along with desires (or intent) and emotions - like pain, pleasure, sorrow or joy - constitute equally important building blocks that shape an individual's cognition of the world around. This multi-sensory cognition colored by emotions inspire action and hence is valid knowledge. This is probably nowhere more apparent than in the world of the visually impaired. Deprived of visual sensory capability, they have to perforce depend on other senses. But the dominant discourse in wider society plays a major role in determining what they (the blind) can do. A society built around visual symbols and the written word underplays other elements of cognition and in the process undervalues them. This also gets reflected in the construction of social artifacts of various kinds, such as the educational certification system (The Braille system is an attempt to make the written world accessible to the blind through tactile signals'so that words are 'felt' and 'read'. But it is quite cumbersome. For instance, even a blind highly skilled at writing in Braille would not be able to match the writing speed of an ordinary visually endowed literate person. Effective and efficient computer-based voice'text'voice converters might solve this problem better.)-based primarily on skills over the written word. Linguistic ability becomes most valuable and at another level the written word gets salience over the spoken word. The blind hardly has a chance, therefore, except through concessions or piety. A practice built around the imagery of an empowered blind person, therefore, must depart from mainstream conceptualization - for power is derived from what one has rather than from what one lacks. It must begin by tapping and valorizing one's own endowments. This paper is an attempt to identify such a departure based on the experience of Blind Opera - a theatre group of the blind working in Kolkata, India. It seeks to provide an exposition in written word of an experience that can only be partially captured within the confines of a text. It is an incomplete account, therefore, and may be taken as an attempt to reach out and seek an exchange of experiences and insights. © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2006.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-33750722443

We first describe engineering design within an evolutionary game-theoretic framework. We then explain why sociality may emerge in some environments and for some agent objectives. Next, we derive the evolutionarily stable design strategy for an agent manufacturer: 1) choosing whether the agent it produces should cooperate with other agents in a search problem and 2) choosing the group size of a multiagent system tasked with a cooperative search problem. We show the impact of ""agent relatedness,"" a measure of common descent between two agents based on their underlying manufacturers, on the choices in scenarios 1) and 2). Our predictions are evaluated in an autonomous vehicle simulation testbed. The results illustrate a new methodology for manufacturers to make robust, optimal choices for multiagent system design for a given set of objectives and domain of operation. Note to Practitioners - The design of autonomous multirobot systems with various applications, such as in parts production or search and destroy operations in a military environment, is of growing importance. Here, we integrate economic and technical issues into an unified engineering design framework for the manufacturers of robots. Our approach leads to manufacturer design decisions that are robust relative to the market for a manufacturer's products. Robot component aspects, such as sensors and communications as well as mission performance aspects, can be captured and coupled into the design process. We use the design of intervehicle cooperation and robot group size to illustrate this approach. The practical significance lies in the fact that we take a broad perspective on engineering design, one closer to the real world, due to the considerations of market-place economics. Moreover, the approach provides a framework to study design choices that escape systematic analysis in other frameworks (e.g., group size). © 2007 IEEE.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-33846296911

The valence of the emotional response varied as a function of the player's active participation (active coping).

In this work the diurnal freeze/thaw effects on energy partition in the context of GAME/ Tibet are studied. A sophisticated land surface model is developed, the particular aspect of which is its physical consideration of soil freeze/ thaw and vapor flux. The simultaneous water and heat transfer soil sub-model not only reflects the water flow from unfrozen zone to frozen fringe in freezing/thawing soil, but also demonstrates the change of moisture and temperature field induced by vapor flux from high temperature zone to low temperature zone, which makes the model applicable for various circumstances. The modified Picard numerical method is employed to help with the water balance and convergence of the numerical scheme. Finally, the model is applied to analyze the diurnal energy and water cycle characteristics over the Tibetan Plateau using the Game/Tibet datasets observed in May and July of 1998. Heat and energy transfer simulation shows that: (i) There exists a negative feedback mechanism between soil freeze/thaw and soil temperature/ground heat flux; (ii) during freezing period all three heat fluxes do not vary apparently, in spite of the fact that the negative soil temperature is higher than that not considering soil freeze; (iii) during thawing period, ground heat flux increases, and sensible heat flux decreases, but latent heat flux does not change much; and (iv) during freezing period, soil temperature decreases, though ground heat flux increases. © Science in China Press 2006.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-33846481025

The mascots that are most representative of artificial life are: robotic insectoids, the game of life and other cellular automata, genetic algorithms, L-systems and simulations of ecosystems. These first workshops, due to the originality of the process, created a considerable stir. They undoubtedly seemed to reach their primary target, that is to allow better communication between researchers. Today, however, a certain breathlessness is noticeable which goes not without reminding the same dying down that characterized the cybernetic and systemic trends (Alife fathers) of the forties and fifties. The multidisciplinarity although essential to the inspiration does not survive, in principle, the specialization which arises naturally as a consequence of several years of study dedicated to a same subject and which drive researchers to privilege interlocutors sharing their same narrow and deep interest. Gradually new scientific communities appear with a more focused object of study and which, either free themselves of the mother field (like genetic algorithms or cellular automata) or become connected with existing communities (like robotics, study of ecosystems, study of the origin of life, study of insects societies). As we can notice during these workshops, ""life"" resists whatever unique and narrow definition. This diversity is the de-stabilizing factor which could cause the burst of artificial life. Besides, the risk is important of a forthcoming divorce, which has already taken place in artificial intelligence, between a so called ""strong"" science which could fuse with an existing scientific tradition (cognitive science for AI and theoretical biology for artificial life) and its so called ""weak"" counterpart with a more engineering like aftertaste and leading to technological innovations (expert systems, fuzzy logic and knowledge engineering in AI, neural networks, genetic algorithms and autonomous robotics in artificial life). If the artificial life star turns into a supernovae to finally explode and leaves behind, as relics of its glorious past, one and only one scientific pulsar, more focused, firmly grounded, and, above all, perpetrating as well as possible the original enthusiasm, the best candidate I can see could be a more formalized study of the emergent phenomena. My contribution to this characterization of emergent phenomena is currently limited to two of them appearing in a large amount of biological networks: the de-stabilizing effect of frustrated connectivity and the tendency to fragment the whole network into small clusters of units showing similar behavior. Among the networks showing these two emergent properties, the attention will be paid to only two of them: Hopfield Neural Networks (HNN) and Idiotypic Immune Networks (INN). Frustrated connectivity is responsible for perturbing the equilibrium dynamics of the network and provoking ""wavering"" among alternative equilibrium regimes. When frustrated a homeostatic network exhibits oscillatory behavior while an oscillatory network falls into a new type of chaotic regime which will be designated as frustrated chaos. In HNN, there is a threshold in the degree of connectivity which marks a sharp transition into the dynamics of the network. Below this threshold, i.e. in the case of a strongly diluted connectivity, the network clusters itself into small group of oscillatory units. In IIN also, this clustering phenomenon prevails and follows very regular rules for the dimension and the distribution of the clusters. It is clear that these two properties can be regarded as emergent since in order to appear they require a specific collective configuration of the units, and in order to be detected they require a level of observation which transcends each unit taken separately. In this paper, rather than theoretical analysis, results of computer simulation are given and briefly explained to illustrate these common properties.© 2006 Springer.

The hypothesis that right wing players perform at a higher intensity than back and forward central players was also tested. Thirty water polo players, equally split between three field positions, participated in the study. Initially, their performance-related physiological capabilities were evaluated. Subsequently, during water polo games of short (4 × 7-min periods) or long duration (4 × 9-min periods), heart rate was monitored continuously and blood lactate concentration was measured at the end of each period. Activity patterns were also recorded using a video camera. Mean heart rate over the entire game was 156 ± 18 beats · min-1. Overall exercise intensity fluctuated around a value corresponding to the lactate threshold (4.03 ± 0.96 mmol · -186 ± 5% of peak heart rate) and decreased (P &lt; 0.003) with game time (4.22 ± 1.8 and 3.47 ± 1.9 mmol · l-1 in the second and fourth quarter, respectively). During the last 6 min, heart rate was higher (P &lt; 0.001) in games of short duration (156 ± 3 beats · min-1) than in games of long duration (152 ± 8 beats · min-1). Video analysis showed that the percentage of time spent in low-intensity activities (i.e. ""out of game"") was lower (23 vs. 26%), whereas that in high-intensity activities (i.e. ""sprinting crawl"") was higher (21 vs. 19%), in games of short compared with long duration. No difference was observed among players of various field positions in any of the variables examined. Thus during match-play, games of long duration produced significantly lower heart rate responses than games of short duration, and the physiological response exhibited by the players was not affected by field position. The water polo authorities should consider these results before changing game duration and coaches should prepare their athletes accordingly.",17175615,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-33750091607

The preceding decade saw numerous advances in evolutionary robotics hardware and software systems. However, the sophistication of resulting robot controllers has remained nearly static over this period of time. Here, we make the case that current methods of controller fitness evaluation are primary factors limiting the further development of ER. To address this, we define a form of fitness evaluation that relies on intra-population competition. In this research, complex neural networks were trained to control robots playing a competitive team game. To limit the amount of human bias or know-how injected into the evolving controllers, selection was based on whether controllers won or lost games. The robots relied on video sensing of their environment, and the neural networks required on the order of 150 inputs. This represents an order of magnitude increase in sensor complexity compared to other research in this field. Evolved controllers were tested extensively in real fully-autonomous robots and in simulation. Results and experiments are presented to characterize the training process and the acquisition of controller competency under different evolutionary conditions. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

G protein-coupled receptor kinase 4 (GRK4) mediates the pressure and natriuresis relation. The present study investigated the impact of GRK4 genetic variants on UNaV under stress. A total of 664 normotensive adolescents including whites and blacks (17.6 ± 3.3 yrs, 43.4% blacks) were recruited. Participants were subjected to a stress-protocol including three 10-min tasks (a social competence interview, a virtual reality car driving simulation test, and a video game challenge), concluded by a urine collection. Three functional polymorphisms including R65L, A142V and A486V were genotyped. Given blacks compared with whites had significantly higher systolic BP (SBP) levels during rest (p < 0.001) and stress (p ≤ 0.001), there was no statistical difference in UNaV in response to stress between the two ethnic groups. In blacks, compared with R65R homozygotes, individuals with R65L or L65L genotype had significantly lower levels of stress-induced UNaV (8.42 ± 0.63 versus 9.85 ± 0.37 mEq/h, p = 0.01). In summary, BP elevation seems uncoupled with UNaV increase during behavioral stress in black adolescents. The 65L allele of the GRK4 gene is associated with stress-induced UNaV reduction, suggesting impaired sodium handling in affected black youth.

The purpose of this study was to describe the variability in energy expenditure for selected physical activities among adolescent girls. Methods: Seventy-four adolescent girls (aged 13 to 14 years) participated in this cross-sectional investigation. Data were collected in 2001 and analyzed in 2004. Energy expenditure was measured by indirect calorimetry for ten activities and during a submaximal cycle ergometer test, which was used to estimate cardiorespiratory fitness. Variability in energy expended for the various activities was expressed by standard deviation, coefficient of variation, and range for three different energy expenditure variables: relative VO2 (milliliters per kilogram per minute), absolute VO2 (liters per minute-1), and calculated metabolic rate (kilojoules per minute). Results: Depending on the expression of energy expenditure, coefficients of variation ranged from a low of 13.2% for climbing stairs to a high of 38.4% for playing a computer game. Some lower-intensity activities were associated with greater variability in energy expenditure. Bicycling showed consistently higher coefficients of variation across expressions of energy expenditure (29.1%, 37.7%, and 33.5% for relative VO2, absolute VO2, and calculated metabolic rate, respectively). Conclusions: Energy expenditure for common activities is highly variable in adolescent girls. The coefficient of variation was higher in some activities of lower intensity, regardless of energy expenditure expression. This variance may influence the evaluation of physical activity interventions, particularly with regard to issues such as a prescribed dose of activity and the statistical power to detect change. © 2006 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.",16979458,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-33748448243

We used video surveillance equipment to document wildlife use of 3 water catchments located in the Sonoran Desert, southwestern Arizona, USA, from June 2000 to November 2003. For each visitation, we recorded time of day, season of use, and activities engaged in, and we correlated visits with temperature and relative humidity.

The number of visits by nongame species (i.e., bats, raptors, mammalian predators, and rodents) exceeded the number of visits by game species (mule deer [Odocoileus hemionus], doves [Zenaida spp.], and Gambel's quail [Callipepia gambelii]). Visitation frequency for turkey vultures (Cathartes aura), owls, diurnal raptors, mule deer, coyotes (Canis latrans), and other mammalian predators increased with temperature. Most visits culminated in the animal drinking water. Other activities recorded were bathing, consumption of plant material and carrion, and intraspecies and interspecies interactions. We recorded 8 predation attempts: 4 by avian predators and 4 by bobcats (Lynx rufus). Although we documented that a number of species frequented water catchments, our observations do not prove need.

In one experiment, affectively valued words directly signaled good and bad choices. A congruent relation between affective value of word and choice outcome improved GT performance, whereas an incongruent relation greatly interfered with performance. In another experiment, affectively valued words were maintained as a working memory (WM) load between GT choices. A WM load with affectively positive words somewhat improved GT performance, whereas affectively negative words interfered with performance. Somatic markers-indicated by differential anticipatory skin conductance response (SCR) amplitude for good and bad choices-appeared at a point in the GT session when choice performance was superior. However, differential SCR developed during the session after good choice performance was already established. These results indicate that preexisting affective biases can influence GT decision making. In addition, the somatic markers that are regular accompaniments of GT decision making appeared to be temporally lagging indicators of choice performance.

However, despite the creation of organisation wide knowledge networks, communication, co-ordination and knowledge sharing between the neighbourhood teams is disappointing. We conducted an action research to investigate how co-ordination in the knowledge networks could be improved with the help of information and communication technologies (ICTs). This article reflects on the choice of co-ordination perspectives and modelling techniques. The above problem is conceptualised and made operational in different ways in research on network co-ordination, knowledge co-ordination and co-ordination of distributed work. The article demonstrates how our initial focus on capturing quantitative measures of the co-ordination problem in a computer simulation was problematic in this case. Instead a social simulation-game that focused on the qualitative issues of this co-ordination problem was developed and played. We conclude that the choice of theoretical perspectives and modelling techniques strongly affected the results of both phases of our action research. Furthermore the article argues that more attention to qualitative issues in co-ordination is required to better understand the impact of ICT-support on co-ordination.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-33749547662

A total of 9718 junior high school children responded (12.8 years) and 9199 questionnaires were used in the present analyses. The questionnaire assessed sleep-wake patterns, TV viewing and videogame habits. Overall, 72.1% of the subjects reported short SOL (≤20 min). Long SOL subjects (>20 min) were strongly associated with disturbed sleep manifested especially by increased risk of night awakenings, decreased sleep depth, and bad sleep in general (overall sleep quality). Prolonged SOL was also associated with daytime sleepiness, difficulties in falling asleep, bad morning feeling and sleep insufficiency. We found a U-shaped relationship between sleep period and SOL. Increase in bedtime was accompanied by increased risk of prolonged SOL. The impact of ultra-short and ultra-long SOL (≤5 and ≥40 min) was also analysed. Long durations of watching television and playing videogame were significantly associated with prolonged SOL. After adjustment for sex, girls presented significantly higher risk of prolonged SOL. Body mass index adjustment did not reveal any significant results. SOL presents a significant component of sleep-wake habits; poor sleep hygiene and insufficient sleep time significantly increase SOL. Parents, healthcare practitioners and children themselves should be aware of the potentially negative influence of prolonged SOL. Additionally, the optimal coherent sleep-wake schedule must be promoted in parallel with the limitation on the viewing TV and game practices. © 2006 European Sleep Research Society.",16911029,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-33747072646

Numerous coalition formation algorithms have been proposed in the software agent literature. Algorithms exist that form agent coalitions in both super additive and non-super additive environments. The algorithmic techniques vary from negotiation-based protocols in multi-agent system (MAS) environments to those based on computation in distributed problem solving (DPS) environments. Coalition formation behaviors have also been discussed in relation to game theory. Despite the plethora of MAS coalition formation literature, to the best of our knowledge none of the proposed algorithms have been demonstrated with an actual multi-robot system. There exists a discrepancy between the multi-agent algorithms and their applicability to the multi-robot domain. This paper aims to bridge that discrepancy by unearthing the issues that arise while attempting to tailor these algorithms to the multi-robot domain. A well-known multi-agent coalition formation algorithm has been studied in order to identify the necessary modifications to facilitate its application to the multi-robot domain.

In this new arrangement, bidding strategy has become a major issue. Participants in this deregulated energy market place may be able to compete better by choosing a suitable bidding strategy for trading electricity. Different classical methods for decision making in the uncertain environment of the market can be applied to select a suitable strategy. Most of these methods, such as game theory, that insure reaching the best solution for all market participants, require a lot of information about the other market players and the market. However, in the real market place only a little information, such as the spot price, is available for all participants. In this paper, a modified reinforcement learning based on temperature variation has been first proposed and then applied to determine the optimal strategy for a power supplier in the electricity market. A Pool-Co model has been considered here, and the simulation results are shown to be the same as those of standard game theory. Adaptation of the method in the presence of parameter variation has been verified as well. The main advantage of the proposed method is that no information about other participants is required.

Across two studies, 64 healthy undergraduate students, ages 18-22, completed Levenson's (LOC) scales for internal, powerful others, and chance prior to performing a video-game task. Participants rated pretask and posttask stressfulness and coping ability (i.e., measures of primary and secondary appraisal). Cardiovascular measures (heart period, HP; preejection period, PEP; respiratory sinus arrhythmia, RSA; cardiac output, CO; systolic blood pressure, SBP; diastolic blood pressure, DBP & total peripheral resistance, TPR) were recorded during 4-minute baseline and 4-minute stressor task periods. The internal LOC factor predicted pretask reports of coping ability as well as posttask reports of stressfulness. In contrast, the powerful-others LOC factor predicted cardiac changes (HP, PEP, and RSA) during the task but not cardiac output or any other vascular change measure. These results underscore the importance of using the three subscales of the Levenson LOC to assess relationships between dispositional LOC and the response to stressors because self-reported appraisals of a task are predicted by a different component of dispositional LOC than are task-related cardiovascular functions. © 2006, Blackwell Publishing, Inc.",16684257,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-33646548256

Based on fundamental concepts from game theory, the MSA provides a formal way of defining and quantifying the contributions of network elements, as well as the functional interactions between them. The previously presented versions of the MSA require full knowledge (or at least an approximation) of the network's performance under all possible multiple perturbations, limiting their applicability to systems with a small number of elements. This article focuses on presenting new scalable MSA variants, allowing for the analysis of large complex networks in an efficient manner, including large-scale neurocontrollers.

Enabling framework of financial globalization essentially includes liberalization and deregulation of the domestic financial sector as well as liberalization of the capital account. As economies progressively integrate globally, pari passu the financial structures of markets and the world of finance change. Financial globalization cannot be considered a novel phenomenon. Trans-country capital movements are centuries old. The oil shock of 1973 and the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, both of these developments were momentous and were responsible for laying the foundation of the contemporary era of financial globalization. After the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, some middle-income developing economies began to liberalize and open up for greater capital mobility, while keeping an autonomous control over their monetary policy. Advances in IT and computer technology are cited as one of the most important factors driving and supporting financial globalization. Transnational corporations (TNCs) also helped in global financial integration. They expanded their networks by merging with or acquiring other national and international firms. The prime movers in financial globalization are governments, borrowers, investors, and financial institutions. Each one of these market participants propelled economies towards financial integration in a proactive manner. Financial globalization has caused dramatic changes in the structure of national and international capital markets. The most significant change in the capital markets was in the banking system, which went through a process of dis-intermediation. This was a market transformation of fundamental nature. Contagions and crises are the downsides of financial globalization. Economic and financial crises of the 1990s portend to the fact that financial globalization is not a win-win game, and that it can potentially lead to serious disorder and high cost in terms of bank failures, corporate bankruptcies, stock market turbulence, depletion of foreign exchange reserves, currency depreciation and increased fiscal burden. A unique characteristic of globalized financial markets is reversal of capital flows when market perception regarding the creditworthiness of the borrowing entity changes. Cross-country financial flows to the emerging market economies were low, at during the mid-1970s. They increased at a healthy clip during the decades of 1980s and 1990s, peaking in 1997. They suffered a sharp decline after that because of the Asian and Russian financial and economic crises. The composition of external capital underwent a dramatic transformation during this period. Official flows either stagnated or declined. As a result their relative significance in global capital flows dwindled. In their place, private capital flows became the major source of external finance for a good number of emerging market economies. FDI became an important and dependable source of finance for the emerging markets and other middle-income economies during the decade of the 1980s and 1990s. Portfolio investment in stocks and bond markets also increased substantially. Global institutional investors found this channel of investment functional and profitable. Mutual funds, insurance companies, and pension funds channeled large amounts through portfolio investment into the emerging market economies. As financial globalization progressed, presence of international financial intermediaries has expanded considerably. This applies more to international commercial banks than to investment banks, insurance companies and mutual funds. It is incorrect to say that their global expansion has been uniform because this has occurred unevenly. International bond issuance activity by emerging market economies recorded a sharp spurt in 1993. Emerging market economies began using ADRs and GDRs for raising capital from the global capital markets in 1990 in a small way. Copyright © 2006 The Berkeley Electronic Press.

Design: Comparison study. Setting: Laboratory of Clinical and Applied Physiology, University of Miami. Participants: Twenty-one boys aged 7 to 10 years. Main Outcome Measures: Blood pressure monitored before and during game play and blood glucose and lactate levels measured before and immediately after game play. Measurements were continuously recorded throughout game play. Dependent t tests were used to compare measurements recorded at baseline and during or after game play. Effect sizes using the Cohen d were examined for comparisons. Results: Significant increases from baseline were found for heart rate (18.8%; P<.001), systolic (22.3%; P<.001) and diastolic (5.8%; P = .006) blood pressure, ventilation (51.9%; P<.001), respiratory rate (54.8%; P<.001), oxygen consumption (49.0%; P<.001), and energy expenditure (52.9%; P<.001). Effect sizes for these comparisons were medium or large. No significant changes were found from baseline to after video game play for lactate (18.2% increase; P = .07) and glucose (0.9% decrease; P = .59) levels.

Thus, it should not be combined with television viewing for the evaluation of sedentary activities. The magnitude of change, however, was lower than that observed during standard physical exercise and below national health recommendations.

We tested for the existence of both short-term and long-term effects for aggressive behavior. We also tested the theory-driven hypothesis that short-term effects should be greater for adults and long-term effects should be greater for children. Design: Meta-analysis. Participants: Children younger than 18 years and adults. Main Exposures: Violent media, including TV, movies, video games, music, and comic books. Main Outcome Measures: Measures of aggressive behavior, aggressive thoughts, angry feelings, physiological arousal (eg, heart rate, blood pressure), and helping behavior. Results: Effect size estimates were combined using meta-analytic procedures. As expected, the short-term effects of violent media were greater for adults than for children whereas the long-term effects were greater for children than for adults. The results also showed that there were overall modest but significant effect sizes for exposure to media violence on aggressive behaviors, aggressive thoughts, angry feelings, arousal levels, and helping behavior. Conclusions: The results are consistent with the theory that short-term effects are mostly due to the priming of existing well-encoded scripts, schemas, or beliefs, which adults have had more time to encode. In contrast, long-term effects require the learning (encoding) of scripts, schemas, or beliefs.

Design: Experimental laboratory study. Setting: University campus situated within an urban environment. Participants: One hundred male undergraduates aged 18 to 21 years. Intervention: Men who had previously reported differing amounts of lifetime home and community violence were randomly assigned to play The Simpsons: Hit and Run (low-violence condition) or Grand Theft Auto III (high-violence condition). Main Outcome Measures: Systolic and diastolic blood pressure; negative affect; hostile social information processing; uncooperative behavior; and permissive attitudes toward violence, alcohol use, marijuana use, and sexual activity without condom use. Results: Men randomly assigned to play Grand Theft Auto III exhibited greater increases in diastolic blood pressure from a baseline rest period to game play, greater negative affect, more permissive attitudes toward using alcohol and marijuana, and more uncooperative behavior in comparison with men randomly assigned to play The Simpsons. Only among participants with greater exposure to home and community violence, play of Grand Theft Auto III led to elevated systolic blood pressure in comparison with play of The Simpsons (mean, 13 vs 5 mm Hg). Conclusions: Media violence exposure may play a role in the development of negative attitudes and behaviors related to health. Although youth growing up in violent homes and communities may become more physiologically aroused by media violence exposure, all youth appear to be at risk for potentially negative outcomes. ©2006 American Medical Association.

The attenuation of pain perception and unpleasantness has been attributed to the patient's attention being diverted from the real, external environment through immersion in a virtual environment transmitted by an interactive 3-D software computer program via a VR helmet. Objectives: To investigate w hether VR immersion can extend the amount of time subjects can tolerate ischemic tourniquet pain. Methods: The study group comprised 20 healthy adult volunteers. The pain was induced by an inflated blood pressure cuff during two separate, counterbalanced, randomized experimental conditions for each subject: One with VR and the control without VR exposure. The VR equipment consisted of a standard computer, a lightweight helmet and an interactive software game. Results: Tolerance time to ischemia was significantly longer for VR conditions than for those without (P < 0.001). Visual Analogue Scale (0-10) ratings were recorded for pain intensity, pain unpleasantness, and the time spent thinking about pain. Affective distress ratings of unpleasantness and of time spent thinking about pain were significantly lower during VR as compared with the control condition (P< 0.003 and 0.001 respectively). Conclusions: The VR method in pain control was shown to be beneficial. The relatively inexpensive equipment will facilitate the use of VR immersion in clinical situations. Future research is necessary to establish the optimal selection of clinical patients appropriate for VR pain therapy and the type of software required according to age, gender, personality, and cultural factors.",16671363,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-33646050004

In particular, this logic allows for the explicit expression of coalition abilities in such systems, modelled as infinite transition games between the coalition and its complement. Formally, ATL is a non-normal multi-modal extension of CTL (regarded as a one-player fragment of ATL) with temporal operators indexed by coalitions of players, and thus expressing selective quantification over those paths which can be effected as outcomes of infinite transition games between the coalition and its complement. We present a sound and complete axiomatization of the logic ATL, based on Pauly's axiomatization of his Coalition Logic, augmented with axioms and rules for fixed point formulae characterizing the temporal operators. The completeness proof is by construction of a bounded branching tree model for each ATL-consistent formula. These models can be folded into finite models, thus rendering the finite model property for ATL. We also describe an automata-based decision procedure for ATL by translating the satisfiability problem to the nonemptiness problem for alternating automata on infinite trees. When considering formulae over a fixed finite set of players the decidability problem is shown to be EXPTIME-complete. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In the present study, 30 healthy undergraduate students played the Ultimatum Game while their skin conductance responses were measured as an autonomic index of affective state. The results revealed that skin conductance activity was higher for unfair offers and was associated with the rejection of unfair offers in the Ultimatum Game.

We tested whether blood pressure changes during psychological stress predict subsequent coronary calcification (CaC) in young healthy adults. We evaluated 2816 healthy black and white women, 20 to 35 years of age, from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study, who were not using medication for hypertension or diabetes in 1987-1988. Participants completed video game and star tracing tasks while their blood pressure was recorded. Thirteen years later (2000-2001), they completed computed tomography measures of CaC. Overall 9.3% (261 of 2816) had CaC present at follow-up. Each 10 mm Hg change in systolic blood pressure during the video game was associated with a 24% increased odds of having CaC at follow-up (unadjusted odds ratio, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.46; P=0.008). This association persisted after adjustment for age, race, sex, education, smoking, alcohol, family history of myocardial infarction, smoking, daily alcohol consumption, body mass index, and resting or baseline blood pressure (odds ratio, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.58; P=0.006). Blood pressure changes during the star tracing task were not associated with subsequent CaC. Blood pressure changes during a video game predicted the presence of CaC 13 years later.

Methods: Four hundred fifty adolescents (mean age = 18.5 ± 2.7 years; 228 [124 males] whites and 222 [110 males] blacks completed two stressors (video game challenge, forehead cold pressor). Hemodynamic measures were taken before, during, and after each stressor. Stressors were separated by a 20-minute rest period. Results: Frequency of detrimental haplotype (Gly16/Glu27) carrier status was greater among whites than blacks (p < .05). A significant three-way interaction among haplotype, BMI, and race for resting systolic blood pressure (SBP) found the highest BP level to be among high BMI carriers, but only for whites. A separate three-way interaction was found to be significant for haplotype, anger-in and race such that high anger-in carriers showed the highest level of resting SBP (p < .05) and total peripheral resistance (TPR) (p < .05) and the greatest TPR reactivity to the cold pressor task (p < .01). Post hoc analyses revealed these interactions with anger-in were only present among blacks. No significant interactions with anger-out for either ethnic group were observed. Conclusions: This study demonstrates modulating influences of BMI and anger expression styles on ADRB2 gene associations with hemodynamic function at rest and in response to laboratory stress. These findings support the hypothesis that consideration of gene-environment interactions may better characterize the role of ADRB2 variation in the development of stress-induced essential hypertension.

Consistent variations in reports of visual discomfort during the female menstrual cycle are found when virtual reality headsets are used to display moving images. Because little is known about the influence of this cycle on susceptibility to visual discomfort in other situations, we performed a laboratory study using an intensive visual task. Methods. Twelve female participants, with normal-length menstrual cycles, completed the study. This required them to play a computer game for 30 minutes while viewing the screen through -2.00-D lenses. Questionnaires were used to record symptom changes; visual acuity and near points of accommodation (NPA) and convergence (NPC) were also recorded both before and after the game. The participants performed this task on designated days (5, 12, 19, and 26) of their menstrual cycle chosen because they fall in line with peaks and troughs of ovarian hormone levels. Cycle phase was confirmed by the measurement of salivary estradiol and progesterone levels. Results. The task performed produced clear changes in all metrics examined. Visual discomfort first increased, on average, after 6 minutes; VA declined on average by 0.02 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution and NPC and NPA both receded by just over 1 cm. However, none of these changes differed significantly at any stage of the menstrual cycle. Conclusions. We conclude that visual discomfort, generated by providing increased accommodative demand while viewing a visual display unit, does not vary significantly during the menstrual cycle.

In a study funded by the Office of Naval Research and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Virtual Reality Medical Center is applying virtual reality (VR) therapy to injured military personnel at the Naval Medical Center San Diego. The goal of this study is to investigate whether augmenting traditional rehabilitation with VR (in this case, off-the-shelf interactive video games) will enable a more rapid and complete rehabilitation. Because VR is interactive and encourages patients to use the entire body to reach goals in the game, VR may make the rehabilitation sessions more comfortable and entertaining. The participants consist of 20 veterans with upper arm and shoulder injuries (rotator cuff tear, shoulder impingement, bursitis). The participants were divided into two groups (n = 10): an experimental group, which would receive traditional rehabilitation augmented by virtual reality therapy, and a control group, which would undergo traditional rehabilitation. The participants will complete ten treatment sessions in their respective condition. Although the study has not yet been completed, preliminary results based on subjective questionnaires and functional capacity indicate that the experimental condition can elicit increased heart rate and respiration. The participants in this group also seem to enjoy the music and interaction made possible through VR. The results suggest that VR can enhance the rehabilitation process, creating a more effective form of treatment. The long-term benefits of this form of treatment may include improved treatment time and reduced drop-out rates, therefore reducing the costs of rehabilitation. © 2006, by Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co.

In such simultaneous planning and learning problems, the agent has to select its actions in a limited amount of time, while sensing only a local part of the environment centered at the agent's current location. Real-time heuristic search agents select actions using a limited lookahead search and evaluating the frontier states with a heuristic function. Over repeated experiences, they refine heuristic values of states to avoid infinite loops and to converge to better solutions. The wide spread of such settings in autonomous software and hardware agents has led to an explosion of real-time search algorithms over the last two decades. Not only is a potential user confronted with a hodgepodge of algorithms, but he also faces the choice of control parameters they use. In this paper we address both problems. The first contribution is an introduction of a simple three-parameter framework (named LRTS) which extracts the core ideas behind many existing algorithms. We then prove that LRTA*, ε-LRTA*, SLA*, and γ-Trap algorithms are special cases of our framework. Thus, they are unified and extended with additional features. Second, we prove completeness and convergence of any algorithm covered by the LRTS framework. Third, we prove several upper-bounds relating the control parameters and solution quality. Finally, we analyze the influence of the three control parameters empirically in the realistic scalable domains of real-time navigation on initially unknown maps from a commercial role-playing game as well as routing in ad hoc sensor networks. © 2006 AI Access Foundation.

This sets a limitation to the use of virtual reality (VR) exposure therapy as a treatment modality for driving phobia. The aim of this study was to investigate if a clinically acceptable immersion/presence rate of >80% could be achieved for driving phobia subjects in computer generated environments by modifying external factors in the driving environment. Eleven patients referred from the Accident and Emergency Department of a general hospital or from their General Practitioner following a motor vehicle accident, who met DSM-IV criteria for Specific Phobia-driving were exposed to a computer-generated driving environment using computer driving games (London Racer/Midtown Madness). In an attempt to make the driving environments ""real enough,"" external factors were modified by (a) projection of images onto a large screen, (b) viewing the scene through a windscreen, (c) using car seats for both driver and passenger, and (d) increasing vibration sense through use of more powerful subwoofers. Patients undertook a trial session involving driving through computer environments with graded risk of an accident. ""Immersion/presence"" was operationally defined as a subjective rating by the subject that the environment ""feels real,"" together with an increase in subjective units of distress (SUD) ratings of >3 and/or an increase of heart rate of >15 beats per minute (BPM).

First, admission control computation can overload a server that is already heavily loaded. Also, in large-scale media systems with geographically distributed server clusters, performing admission control on each cluster can result in long response latency, if the client request is denied at one site and has to be forwarded to another site. Furthermore, in prefix caching, initial frames cached at the proxy are delivered to the client before the admission decisions are made. If the media server is heavily loaded and, finally, has to deny the client request, forwarding a large number of initial frames is a waste of critical network resources. In this paper, a novel distributed admission control model is presented. We make use of proxy servers to perform the admission control tasks. Each proxy hosts an agent to coordinate the effort. Agents reserve media server's disk bandwidth and make admission decisions autonomously based on the allocated disk bandwidth. We develop an effective game theoretic framework to achieve fairness in the bandwidth allocation among the agents. To improve the overall bandwidth utilization, we also consider an aggressive admission control policy where each agent may admit more requests than its allocated bandwidth allows. The distributed admission control approach provides the solution to the stated problems incurred in conventional admission control models. Experimental studies show that our algorithms significantly reduce the responce latency and the media server load. © 2005 IEEE.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-30344476099

In this paper, we present a storytelling approach, which is based on the premise that story and narrative may emerge from characters' interactions during the creation activity, but such characters may either act autonomously or be controlled by children. Since we position our research in an educational context, we argue that in such creation activities children's thoughts and needs must be respected and contribute directly to the achievement of the story. Therefore, children should be provided with some support and guidance directives to help them to better understand and reflect on the role-taking situations they experience during such activity. To prove the validity of our approach we developed a generic architecture - Support And Guidance Architecture (SAGA). SAGA aims not only to provide support and guidance to children during the story telling activities, by combining the roles of a dynamic script writer and a drama manager, but also to provide such services to already existing story creation applications. To illustrate this, we have integrated SAGA with Teatrix, a collaborative virtual environment for story creation, and an evaluation study was conducted in order to find the impact of SAGA in children's storytelling activities. © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2005.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-30044446115

Below this temperature equilibrium is no longer reached within finite time and the behaviour of such systems becomes non ergodic. Among those are diluted alloys of magnetic ions in a non magnetic matrix, so called spin-glasses [1], supercooled liquids [2] entering some glassy state at low temperature or particles moving in a random potential exhibiting a transition from diffusion to creep or pinning [3, 4]. The temporal behaviour of such systems is often referred to as glassy dynamics. Below the characteristic temperature aging is observed [5]. If, for instance, a spin-glass is cooled in a magnetic field and kept for some waiting time, the complete decay of the magnetisation after the field has been switched off, is hindered for times of the order of the waiting time. Similar phenomena are observed for the deformation of glasses under the influence of applied forces. Glassy dynamics can also be of relevance for systems and phenomena outside physics. For some combinatorial optimisation problems simulated annealing is used in order to find good solutions. This means that some stochastic dynamics, characterized by some 'temperature', is used in order to find minima of a properly defined cost function. If such a system exhibits a freezing transition, it is not effective to spend much time in simulated annealing below this temperature and investigating the dynamics slightly above the freezing transition is much more efficient [6]. Other examples of systems of interest outside physics are models of neural networks or certain aspects of markets and other economical systems [7]. The systems mentioned above are classical. There is also interest in quantum mechanical disordered systems, for instance in certain spin-glasses or in interacting tunnelling systems being of relevance for glasses at very low temperatures. This lecture deals, however, with classical dynamical systems only.A breakthrough of our understanding of the low temperature properties of glassy systems came from replica theory and the replica symmetry breaking scheme proposed by Parisi [8]. This theory focuses on the evaluation of the free energy averaged over some frozen disorder. The picture emerging from this theory is a decomposition of phase space into so called pure states or ergodic components, separated by barriers of infinite hight in the thermodynamic limit. Investigating the overlap among those states, an ultrametric organization reveals. An alternative treatment of systems with quenched disorder is via dynamics [9, 10, 11, 12]. This will be the subject of this lecture. As it turns out there are many features and results common to both treatments, but there are also differences which will be discussed. In Sect. 2 I present some of the systems of interest, in particular spinglasses, supercooled liquids and glasses, drift, creep and pinning of a particle in a random potential, neural networks, graph partitioning as an example of combinatorial optimisation, the K-sat problem, a prototype problem from computer science, and finally the minority game as a model for the behaviour of agents on markets. Section 3 deals with the dynamics of the spherical p-spin-glass with long ranged interactions. This model is a prototype for glassy dynamics. The equations of motion for correlation- and response-functions are derived and equilibrium solutions above the freezing temperature are investigated. Below the freezing temperature the system behaves for short time as if it were in equilibrium, for longer time its off equilibrium nature becomes apparent and correlation- and response-functions depend on waiting time. This is the manifestation of aging. At the end of Sect. 3 I discuss the so called crossover region and aging in glasses. Within mode coupling theory, which is discussed in the contribution of R. Schilling [13] in this volume, and which shows great similarity to the p-spin model, a dynamical transition is found at some critical temperature Tc. This is sometimes referred to as 'ideal glass transition'. Comparison with experiments shows that this transition is actually smeared out and the fitted Tc is well above the actual glass transition region. Some smearing out also results from an extended version of the mode coupling theory, which applies, however, to equilibrium only. I am going to discus a modified version of the p-spin model, which is able to take account for this rounding as well as aging. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.",,"English",Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-84890166358

This can be modelled as the outcome of a feedback system that accumulates experience. In this paper we investigate such a feedback system, following an iterative research approach. A feedback loop is specified that is detailed using contemporary ideas on human behaviour. The resulting model is investigated in an empirical study. Finally, we consider a computational mechanism to explain the results. This approach is aimed at understanding how a feedback mechanism might work rather than at observing its outcomes. In this paper, we study the approach through adjustments in card selections in a game consisting of repeated card choices. Playing this game, participants do not know what rules determine gains and losses. Therefore there is some tension between exploring the options and achieving immediate profit. To decide in such situations it is argued that often evaluations below the level of conscious awareness, such as affect, play an important role. The results support the hypothesis that participants would draw better cards as the game progressed. There is some evidence that emotions are involved, since the hypothesis that profit and emotions are correlated is confirmed. Further evidence that formal logic is not sufficient follows from the observed effects of music on card selections. In the second part of the paper the aim is to understand the results from a computational point of view. Four possible ways of integrating feedback into a decision criterion are compared. Using one of these mechanisms, a computational model is investigated that might describe the role of music in card selection. Although there are limitations to both the empirical and computational findings, the chosen approach indicates that computational modelling of experiential appraisal, at a preconscious level, and the effect of external factors, such as music, is in principle feasible, and can lead to a research agenda aimed at understanding such phenomena. © Springer 2005.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-28344440997

The results showed that jumpers' steady flight position was almost completed within 0.5 s. The most significant correlation with the length of the jump was found in the angle between the skis and body (r=.714, p≤.001 at 1.1 s after the take-off). This particular phase seemed to be important because the ski angle of attack was also related to the jumping distance at the same phase. Although the more upright ski position relative to flight path resulted in longer jumping distance, the winner of the competition had significantly lower ski position as compared to the other good jumpers. This may be due to the high altitude (>2000 m) of the ski jumping stadium in this competition. Because of the low air density, the aerodynamic forces were also low and this probably caused less skilful jumpers to lean too much forward at this phase.

How do we as responsible parents, governments etc promote good health when there appears to be an ever growing tendency away from active sports towards more sedentary entertainments such as TV, Internet and computer games? Indeed some researchers argue that the popularity of computer games can be cited as a contributing factor to the higher percentage in obesity amongst adolescents. There is some evidence that the intrinsic appeal of computer games lures individuals into sedentary game playing as an alternative to other activities of a more physical nature e.g. sport. An alternate view is that the infrastructure of computer games technology presents the individual game player with a wider range of opportunities than those afforded by traditional sports (e.g. control, participation, social constructs etc). An initial study highlights the possible contribution of computer games as physical activity specialists. In order to substantiate this possible avenue of research a series of ad hoc experiments have been carried out utilising fitness metrics such as heart rate and blood pressure in a variety of scenarios.

The ET-1/Lys198Asn polymorphism has been associated with increased resting BP and exaggerated vasoconstrictive mediated BP reactivity. African Americans (AAs) are at particular risk for development of EH, report greater anger difficulties, and exhibit greater vasoconstrictive reactivity than their European American (EA) counterparts. Purpose: The objective is to investigate a gene-environment model of stress reactivity in which anger expression, particularly in combination with ET-1 T allele carrier status and AA ethnicity, would be associated with the greatest vasoconstrictive reactivity in response to a behavioral stressor. Methods: One hundred ninety-one AA and 197 EA normotensive young adults (M age = 18.8 ± 2.5 years) participated in the study. Total peripheral resistance index (TPRI) reactivity was assessed during a 10-min video game challenge. Anger expression was measured using Spielberger's Anger Expression Scale. Results: A multiple regression model with TPRI reactivity as the dependent variable revealed a three-way interaction effect for anger management (i.e., AM = anger control minus anger out scores), ethnicity, and ET-1 polymorphism. Specifically, AA carriers of the ET-1 polymorphism with poor AM skills exhibited the greatest TPRI reactivity. Conclusions: Individuals with a genetic predisposition for exaggerated vasoconstriction who also display low AM skills may be at particular risk for development of stress-induced EH. Such individuals may particularly benefit from anger management training. © 2005 by The Society of Behavioral Medicine.",16097909,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-23944499551

Decision conflict attenuates due to learning which is often indicated by and therefore confounded with the receipt of increasingly frequent positive and decreasingly frequent negative feedback. The present functional Magnetic Resonance study aimed to disentangle the influence of the factors processing of negative feedback and contextual feedback evaluation on pFMC activation. Participants performed a forced choice paradigm in which they had to decide which one out of two competing stimuli would win in a virtual competition game. In one condition (rule learning, RL), participants were provided with valid feedback so that contextual feedback evaluation had a guiding function for action and thus enabled learning. In contrast, participants received no valid information from feedback in another condition (putative learning, PL) and hence could not learn on the basis of contextual feedback evaluation. However, a learning effect in the latter condition was simulated by gradually increasing the frequency of positive feedback and decreasing the frequency of negative feedback according to a learning model which was derived from pilot data. Importantly, participants were naive with respect to feedback manipulations. Beyond confirming pFMC activation for decision conflicts, a significant interaction between validity and valence of feedback in pFMC revealed the specific contribution of contextual feedback evaluation processes on activation of this area. Not the processing of negative feedback per se, which was found to elicit activation within anterior cingulate cortex, but the evaluation of feedback against the background of the current mental model is suggested to be reflected by pFMC activation. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

The work is motivated by the aim of creating a synthetic agent that can observe a scene containing interactions between unknown objects and agents, and learn models of these sufficient to act in accordance with the implicit protocols present in the scene. Discrete concepts (utterances and object properties), and temporal protocols involving these concepts, are learned in an unsupervised manner from continuous sensor input alone. Crucial to this learning process are methods for spatio-temporal attention applied to the audio and visual sensor data. These identify subsets of the sensor data relating to discrete concepts. Clustering within continuous feature spaces is used to learn object property and utterance models from processed sensor data, forming a symbolic description. The progol Inductive Logic Programming system is subsequently used to learn symbolic models of the temporal protocols presented in the presence of noise and over-representation in the symbolic data input to it. The models learned are used to drive a synthetic agent that can interact with the world in a semi-natural way.

The verification is based on high-density observations collected by the Meso West cooperative networks, including approximately 200 wind and temperature sites and 100 precipitation sites across northern Utah. Wind and precipitation forecasts produced by the 4-km MM5 domain were m ore accurate (based on traditional measures) than those of its parent 12-km domain. The most significant improvements in wind speed forecasts occurred at night in valleys and lowland locations where the topography of the 4-km domain produced more accurate nocturnal flows. Wind direction forecast improvements were most substantial at mountain sites where the better topographic resolution of the 4-km domain more accurately reflected the exposure of these locations to the free atmosphere. The 4-km domain also produced quantitative precipitation forecasts that were either equally (small events) or more (large events) accurate than the 12-km domain. Precipitation bias errors varied substantially between the two domains since the representation of the region's narrow, steeply sloped, basin-and-range topography improved dramatically at 4-kM grid spacing. Curiously, the overall accuracy of t emperature forecasts by the 4-km domain was not significantly better than that of the 12-km domain. This was due to an inability of the MM5 to properly simulate nocturnal and persistent cold pools within mountain valleys and the lowlands upstream of the Wasatch Mountains. Paradoxically, the added resolution of the 4-km domain, coupled with the failure of this version of the MM5 to fully capture the nocturnal and persistent cold pools, resulted in poorer skill scores. At upper elevations, which are typically above the cold pools, the 4-km domain was substantially more accurate. These results illustrate that decreasing horizontal grid spacing to less than 10 km does improve wind and precipitation forecasts over finescale Intermountain West topography. It is hypothesized that model improvements will ultimately enable the advantages of added model resolution to be fully realized for temperature forecasts over the Intermountain West. © 2005 American Meteorological Society.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-27544459449

A TAC agent simulates one vision of future travel agents: it represents a set of clients in simultaneous auctions, trading complementary (e.g., airline tickets and hotel reservations) and substitutable (e.g., symphony and theater tickets) goods. RoxyBot faced two key technical challenges in TAC: (i) allocation - - assigning purchased goods to clients at the end of a game instance so as to maximize total client utility, and (ii) completion - - determining the optimal quantity of each resource to buy and sell given client preferences, current holdings, and market prices. For the dimensions of TAC, an optimal solution to the allocation problem is tractable, and RoxyBot uses a search algorithm based on A* to produce optimal allocations. An optimal solution to the completion problem is also tractable, but in the interest of minimizing bidding cycle time, RoxyBot solves the completion problem using beam search with a greedy heuristic, producing approximately optimal completions.

A cluster analysis applied to the observations suggests three benthic faunal communities based on depth: 1) a shallow-water community (151-950 m) consisting mainly of rockfishes, flatfishes, sea stars, and attached suspension feeders, 2) a mid-depth community (400-1500 m) also consisting of numerous attached suspension-feeding organisms such as corals, sponges, crinoids, sea anemones, and sea cucumbers and fish such as the sablefish Anoplopoma fimbria and the giant grenadier Albatrossia pectoralis both of which were aggregated over a relatively narrow depth range, and 3) a deep-water community (500-3,375 m) consisting of fewer attached suspension feeders and more highly mobile species such as the Pacific grenadier Coryphaenoides acrolepis, popeye grenadier C. cinereus, Pacific flatnose Antimora microlepis, and large mobile crabs Macroregonia macrochira and Chionoecetes spp. that were less aggregated and covered a much greater depth range. Bottom depth was highly correlated with temperature and bottom substratum type where the upper 1,300 m was primarily a mixed habitat of boulders and large cobbles. The bottom substratum types were less diverse from 1,300 m to 3,300 m, which was composed of gravels and smaller sized particles.

However, the exact source of these effects remains unclear. Given the well-known effects of sound on physiological activity, especially those of noise and of music, and on the secretion of the stress hormone cortisol in particular, we hypothesized that music may be a major source of stress during video game playing. We thus examined the effect of built-in music on cortisol secretion as a consequence of video game playing. Players were assigned quasi-randomly to either a Music or a Silence condition. Four saliva samples were taken, that is, after practice (T1), immediately after having played for 10 minutes (T2), 15 minutes after the end of the experiment (T3), and 30 minutes after the end of the experiment (T4). The results show that the Music group had significantly higher cortisol levels at T3, that is, when cortisol levels are assumed to reflect the stress induced by the game.

With the use of sophisticated facial motions from a human performer, animated characters are far more lively and convincing. However, editing motion data is difficult, limiting the potential of reusing the motion data for different tasks. To address this problem, statistical techniques have been applied to learn models of the facial motion in order to derive new motions based on the existing data. Most existing research focuses on audio-to-visual mapping and reordering of words, or on photo-realistically matching the synthesized face to the original performer. Little attention has been paid to modifying and controlling facial expression, or to mapping expressive motion onto other 3D characters. This article describes a method for creating expressive facial animation by extracting information from the expression axis of a speech performance. First, a statistical model for factoring the expression and visual speech is learned from video. This model can be used to analyze the facial expression of a new performance or modify the facial expressions of an existing performance. With the addition of this analysis of the facial expression, the facial motion can be more effectively retargeted to another 3D face model. The blendshape retargeting technique is extended to include subsets of morph targets that belong to different facial expression groups. The proportion of each subset included in a final animation is weighted according to the expression information. The resulting animation conveys much more emotion than if only the motion vectors were used for retargeting. Finally, since head motion is very important in adding liveness to facial animation, we introduces an audio-driven synthesis technique for generating new head motion. © 2005 ACM.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-33645764471

Recent views focus on the role of infection in the education of the immune system of young children. However, this so called hygiene hypothesis fails to answer some important questions about the current trends in asthma or to account for environmental influences that bear little relation to infection. Discussion: The multi-factorial nature of asthma, reflecting the different ways we tend to interact with our environment, mandates that we look at the asthma epidemic from a broader perspective. Seemingly modern affluent lifestyles are placing us increasingly in static, artificial, microenvironments very different from the conditions prevailed for most part of our evolution and shaped our organisms. Changes that occurred during the second half of the 20th century in industrialized nations with the spread of central heating/conditioning, building insulation, hygiene, TV/PC/games, manufactured food, indoor entertainment, cars, medical care, and sedentary lifestyles all seem to be depriving our children from the essential inputs needed to develop normal airway function (resistance). Asthma according to this view is a manifestation of our respiratory maladaptation to modern lifestyles, or in other words to our increasingly artificial habitats. The basis of the artificial habitat notion may lie in reduced exposure of innate immunity to a variety of environmental stimuli, infectious and non-infectious, leading to reduced formulation of regulatory cells/cytokines as well as inscribed regulatory pathways. This could contribute to a faulty checking mechanism of non-functional Th2 (and likely Th1) responses, resulting in asthma and other immuno-dysregulation disorders. Summary: In this piece I discuss the artificial habitat concept, its correspondence with epidemiological data of asthma and allergy, and provide possible immunological underpinning for it from an evolutionary perspective of health and disease. © 2005 Maziak; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",15799786,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-26844435104

PC Game Rooms provide users with high-performance PC connected to the high-speed internet, and access to computer games. However, PC Game Room users are exposed to various hazardous agents such as cigarette smoke in a confined environment, and thus it is likely that excessive PC Game Room use involves abnormal exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) as well as being associated with disturbed sleep or circadian rhythm. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, the exposure to PAH was evaluated by measuring urinary 1-hydroxypyrene (1-OHP) and 2-naphthol. The correlations between PC Game Room use and PAH exposure and plasma testosterone and LH levels were analysed in 208 young male Koreans. Results: Urinary 1-OHP concentrations increased (P = 0.0001) and plasma testosterone levels decreased (P = 0.0153) significantly with increased duration of PC Game Room use. Correlation analysis showed that plasma testosterone concentrations were significantly negatively correlated with urinary 1-OHP (r = -0.22, P = 0.0012) and 2-naphthol (r = -0.15, P = 0.0308) concentrations. Moreover, these associations persisted after adjusting for other independent variables. However, the duration of PC Game Room use itself was not found to be an independent significant determinant of plasma testosterone level. Rather, PC Game Room use increased PAH exposure, which decreased plasma testosterone level. The younger age group (15-19 years) showed a more prominent decrease in plasma testosterone concentrations with increasing duration of PC Game Room use than the older age group (20-24 years) (r2 = 0.355, P = 0.0301 versus r2 = 0.213, P = 0.0001). Conclusions: These results imply that the excessive use of PC Game Rooms is related to an adverse impact on sex hormonal status in young male Koreans via PAH exposure. This effect was more prominent in the younger age group. © The Author 2004. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology.

The task has been employed in a wide range of formats, from 'manual' procedures to more recently introduced computerised versions. Computer-based formats often require that responses on the task should be artificially delayed by a number of seconds between trials to collect skin-conductance data. Participants, however, may become frustrated when they want to select from a particular deck in the time-limited versions-so that an unintended emotional experience of frustration might well disrupt a task presumed to be reliant on emotion-based learning. We investigated the effect of the various types of Iowa Gambling Task format on performance, using three types of task: the classic manual administration, with no time limitations; a computerised administration with a 6-s enforced delay; and a control computerised version which had no time constraints. We also evaluated the subjective experience of participants on each task. There were no significant differences in performance, between formats, in behavioural terms. Subjective experience measures on the task also showed consistent effects across all three formats-with substantial, and rapidly developing, awareness of which decks were 'good' and 'bad.' © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The character acts as a quizmaster in the context of a mathematical game. This application was chosen as a simple, and for the sake of the experiment, highly controllable, instance of human-computer interfaces and software. Subtle expressivity refers to the character's affective response to the user's performance by emulating multimodal human-human communicative behavior such as different body gestures and varying linguistic style. The impact of em-pathic behavior, which is a special form of affective response, is examined by deliberately frustrating the user during the game progress. There are two novel aspects in this investigation. First, we employ an animated interface agent to address the affective state of users rather than a text-based interface, which has been used in related research. Second, while previous empirical studies rely on questionnaires to evaluate the effect of life-like characters, we utilize physiological information of users (in addition to questionnaire data) in order to precisely associate the occurrence of interface events with users' autonomic nervous system activity. The results of our study indicate that empathic character response can significantly decrease user stress and that affective behavior may have a positive effect on users' perception of the difficulty of a task. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

In its initial version, MoCalc can execute the following operations: (a) create and handle Gamess and Mopac input files; (b) import any kind of molecular geometry supported by Babel and paste it as Cartesian, internal, or Gaussian-type coordinates on the input file; (c) convert Gamess and Mopac output files to inputs of both programs; (d) edit and validate the keywords that control the Gamess and Mopac calculation procedure; (e) display the input (Mopac) and output (Gamess and Mopac) molecular geometries; (f) run single or multiple (batch) calculations, either interactively or in background; (g) automatically open the output files as soon as the calculation finishes; (h) extract results from the output files, such as energy, charges, dipole, population analysis, wave function, bond orders, and valence analysis, and display them in spreadsheets; (i) calculate reactivity indices derived from the frontier orbital theory and the root-mean-square (rms) deviation of input and output geometries. All the results generated by MoCalc can be promptly transferred to text editors and electronic spreadsheets, which facilitate a detailed subsequent analysis and the publication of the results. MoCalc can also perform graphical and numerical comparative analysis of the some results when more than one output file is loaded.

We concurrently assessed energy expenditure and accelerometer counts during physical activities on adolescent girls to develop an equation to predict energy expenditure. Methods: Seventy-four girls aged 13-14 yr performed 10 activities while wearing an Actigraph accelerometer and a portable metabolic measurement unit (Cosmed K4b2). The activities were resting, watching television, playing a computer game, sweeping, walking 2.5 and 3.5 mph, performing step aerobics, shooting a basketball, climbing stairs, and running 5 mph. Height and weight were also assessed. Mixed-model regression was used to develop an equation to predict energy expenditure (EE) (kJ·min-1) from accelerometer counts. Results: Age (mean [SD] = 14 yr [0.34]) and body-weight-adjusted correlations of accelerometer counts with EE (kJ·min-1) for individual activities ranged from -0.14 to 0.59. Higher intensity activities with vertical motion were best correlated. A regression model that explained 85% of the variance of EE was developed: [EE (kJ·m-1) = 7.6628 + 0.1462 [(Actigraph counts per minute - 3000)/100] + 0.2371 (body weight in kilograms) - 0.00216 [(Actigraph counts per minute - 3000)/100]2 + 0.004077 [((Actigraph counts per minute - 3000)/100) x (body weight in kilograms)]. The MCCC = 0.85, with a standard error of estimate = 5.61 kJ·min-1. Conclusions: We developed a prediction equation for kilojoules per minute of energy expenditure from Actigraph accelerometer counts.

The story, the emotion and the relationship between the player and the world they are interacting within are hugely dependent on how appropriately the world's characters look, move and behave. We're concerned here with the character's motion; with next generation game consoles like Xbox360TM and Playstation®3 the graphical representation of characters will take a major step forward which places even more emphasis on the motion of the character. The behavior of the character is driven by story and design which are adapted to game context by the game's AI system. The motion of the characters populating the game's world, however, is evolving to an interesting blend of kinematics, dynamics, biomechanics and AI drivenmotion planning. Our goal here is to present the technologies involved in creating what are essentially character automata, emotionless and largely brainless character shells that nevertheless exhibit enough ""behavior"" to move as directed while adapting to the environment through sensing and actuating responses. This abstracts the complexities of low level motion control, dynamics, collision detection etc. and allows the game's artificial intelligence system to direct these characters at a higher level. While much research has already been conducted in this area and some great results have been published, we will present the particular issues that face game developers working on current and next generation consoles, and how these technologies may be integrated into game production pipelines so to facilitate the creation of character performances in games. The challenges posed by the limited memory and CPU bandwidth (though this is changing somewhat with next generation) and the challenges of integrating these solutions with current game design approaches leads to some interesting problems, some of which the industry has solutions for and some others which still remain largely unsolved. © The Eurographics Association and Blackwell Publishing 2005.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-33745321682

Although inhalational anesthetics blunt hypoxic ventilation, this effect is reversed by audiovisual stimulation but not by pain. Opioids reduce both normoxic and hypoxic ventilation, but their interaction with pain and audiovisual stimulation has not been fully reported. Methods: Isocapnic, acute hypoxic ventilatory responses (AHRs) were measured in 11 volunteers. AHR and normoxic ventilation were measured under the following conditions: (1) eyes closed, no audio stimulation (low wakefulness); (2) low wakefulness conditions plus painful thermal stimulation; and (3) playing a computer game (high wakefulness), each with and without remifentanil infusion. Results: The average (± SD) remifentanil dose was 0.035 ± 0.012 μg · kg-1 · min-1. Both normoxic and hypoxic ventilation were significantly reduced by the remifentanil infusion under all three conditions. The AHR values under low wakefulness conditions were 0.33 ± 0.19 and 0.89 ± 0.49 1 · min-1 · sat-1 with and without remifentanil, respectively (P &lt; 0.05). High wakefulness significantly increased AHR with and without remifentanil, whereas low wakefulness with pain did not. However, high wakefulness with remifentanil did not increase the AHR back to what was observed during low wakefulness without remifentanil. Conclusions: The computer game was a more potent stimulus than pain in countering the depressant effect of remifentanil on AHR. Although the effect of high wakefulness was more attenuated than was previously observed with respect to inhalational anesthetics, the significance of these findings is underlined by the more clinically relevant scenario of what is experienced in the face of opioid administration. © 2005 American Society of Anesthesiologists, Inc.

Optimal parameters for voice quality conversion, however, are speaker dependent, and consequently, no clear-cut algorithm has existed in the past and parameter adjustment has usually been performed by an experienced designer on a trial and error basis. This paper proposes the application of evolutionary computation, a stochastic search technique based on organic evolution, to parameter adjustment for voice conversion, and reports on several experimental results applicable to the fitting of prosodic coefficients. Evolutionary computation is said to be ""applicable to even cases where the properties of the target function are not well known,"" and we decided to apply it considering that this feature might be effective in our study. Providing an explicit evaluative function for evolutionary computation, however, is difficult, and we here adopt an interactive-evolution system in which genetic manipulation is performed repeatedly while evaluating results based on human emotions. Evaluation experiments were performed on raw human speech recorded by a microphone and speech mechanically synthesized from text. It was found that the application of evolutionary computation could achieve voice conversion satisfying specific targets with relatively little degradation of sound quality and no impression of artificial processing in comparison to parameter adjustment based on designer experience or trial and error. This paper also shows that prosodic conversion coefficients determined by the interactive evolution technique, while exhibiting speaker dependency, is not text dependent. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

From a single agent's perspective, sending out as many queries as possible maximizes the chances of finding the information sought. However, if every agent does the same, the servers will be overloaded. The first major contribution of this paper is proving mathematically that the agents situated in such environments play the n-Person Prisoner's Dilemma Game. The second is mathematically deriving the notion of effectiveness of cooperation among the agents in such environments and then presenting the optimal interval for the number of information sites for a given number of information-seeking agents. When the optimal interval is satisfied, cooperation among agents is effective, meaning that resources (e.g., servers) are optimally shared. Experimental results suggest that agents can better share available servers through the kinship-based cooperation without explicitly knowing about the entire environment. This paper also identifies difficulties of promoting cooperation in such environments and presents possible solutions.

Methods: We implemented a biosurveillance detection system from Pennsylvania to monitor the 2002 Winter Olympic Games. Because input data was in free-text format, we used a natural language processing text classifier to automatically classify free-text triage chief complaints into syndromic categories used by the biosurveillance system.

Using information stored in the system's semantic model, we extracted from the Respiratory classifications lower respiratory complaints and lower respiratory complaints with fever with a precision of 0.97 and 0.96, respectively. Conclusion: Results suggest that a trainable natural language processing text classifier can accurately extract data from free-text chief complaints for biosurveillance. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry was performed in 127 African American and white youths to assess lean body mass (LBM), fat mass (FM), and total percentage of body fat (%BF). The stress protocol was comprised of a 2-h baseline period, 1-h video game competition stressor, and 2-h recovery period. Blood and urine samples were collected hourly and blood pressure (BP) was obtained at 15-min intervals. Both BP and urinary sodium excretion(U NaV) increased from baseline to stress and returned to prestress levels after stress (P =. 001 for each). The BP levels and changes were positively correlated with LBM. In contrast, levels and changes in sodium excretion U NaV were inversely correlated with FM and %BM. Multiple regression analyses that included ethnicity, sex, angiotensin II (Ang II), and measures of body composition in the models indicated the following: a) LBM was the best predictor of stress systolic BP and independently contributed with ethnicity to stress diastolic BP; b) ethnicity was the only independent predictor of the stress-related change in systolic and diastolic BP; c) LBM was the only independent predictor of the change in BP from stress to recovery for both systolic and diastolic BP; and d) total percent body fat accounted for 11.2% of the variance of stress U NaV, with Ang II contributing an additional 6.1%.

In this fMRI, study individuals played a specially designed computer game, according to a set of predefined rules, either in cooperation with or in competition against another person. The hemodynamic response during these conditions was contrasted to that of the same subjects playing the game independently. Both cooperation and competition stances resulted in activation of a common frontoparietal network subserving executive functions, as well as the anterior insula, involved in autonomic arousal. Moreover, distinct regions were found to be selectively associated with cooperation and competition, notably the orbitofrontal cortex in the former and the inferior parietal and medial prefrontal cortices in the latter. This pattern reflects the different mental frameworks implicated in being cooperative versus competitive with another person. In accordance with evidence from evolutionary psychology as well as from developmental psychology, we argue that cooperation is a socially rewarding process and is associated with specific left medial orbitofrontal cortex involvement. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

However, research to date has largely ignored long-term control issues such as the timing of resource reconfigurations, which are vital for the avoidance of myopic decision-making. As traditional analysis techniques implicitly assume centralized analysis and implementation of policies, they are not directly applicable to heterarchical environments. A non-cooperative game-theoretic planning technique for autonomous analyses of reconfiguration decisions by heterarchical machine controllers is described. Under the proposed system, a machine controller evaluates a set-up game to determine appropriate actions when faced with a sequence-independent reconfiguration decision. The prescribed action is defined by a pure or mixed-strategy equilibrium of the set-up game. By evaluating a game, the machine controller accounts for the potential actions and reactions of other machine controllers in the system. The approach allows the autonomous machine controller to make set-up decisions about future actions while preserving the independence characteristic of controllers in heterarchical environments.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-5144228050

Inspired by biological phenomena (bird flocking, fish schooling, etc.), particle systems have been used not only for biological modeling, but also increasingly for applications requiring the simulation of collective movements such as computer-generated animation. In this research, we take some first steps in extending particle systems so that they not only move collectively, but also solve simple problems. This is done by giving the individual particles (agents) a rudimentary intelligence in the form of a very limited memory and a top-down, goal-directed control mechanism that, triggered by appropriate conditions, switches them between different behavioral states and thus different movement dynamics. Such enhanced particle systems are shown to be able to function effectively in performing simulated search-and-collect tasks. Further, computational experiments show that collectively moving agent teams are more effective than similar but independently moving ones in carrying out such tasks, and that agent teams of either type that split off members of the collective to protect previously acquired resources are most effective. This work shows that the reflexive agents of contemporary particle systems can readily be extended to support goal-directed problem solving while retaining their collective movement behaviors. These results may prove useful not only for future modeling of animal behavior, but also in computer animation, coordinated movement control in robotic teams, particle swarm optimization, and computer games. © 2004 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",15479544,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-4444283709

Based on the VFSA algorithm, we design a land data assimilation scheme which can assimilate both the in situ measurement of soil moisture, and the passive microwave remote sensing observations into a land surface model. The scheme is tested with GAME-Tibet observations and TMI brightness temperature.

The data have been plotted and discussed, in order that exercise program planning practitioners may gain improved understandings of the physiological requirements for referees. Some specific training suggestions have also been made. Methods: The HR was recorded every five seconds throughout six competition NRL matches; using a heart rate monitor with a built-in memory. Results: The specific magnitudes of referees' HR mean values varied between individuals, possibly due to specific game intensities, referee fitness, and age. All referees however exhibited similar HR response patterns; characterised by frequent (13-20 per match) large transient upward and downward shifts (&gt;20 beats.minute-1). Periods of elevated HR extended for between five sec and eight min at a time, and were further characterised as a typical cyclic wave of HR elevation and recovery (ranging from 99.2±12.4 beats.minute-1 to 176.5±11.8 beats.minute-1 [mean ±95% CI]), with a work to rest ratio of 2:1.

The effects appear larger for milder than for more severe forms of aggression, but the effects on severe forms of violence are also substantial (r = .13 to .32) when compared with effects of other violence risk factors or medical effects deemed important by the medical community (e.g., effect of aspirin on heart attacks). The research base is large; diverse in methods, samples, and media genres; and consistent in overall findings. The evidence is clearest within the most extensively researched domain, television and film violence. The growing body of video-game research yields essentially the same conclusions. Short-term exposure increases the likelihood of physically and verbally aggressive behavior, aggressive thoughts, and aggressive emotions. Recent large-scale longitudinal studies provide converging evidence linking frequent exposure to violent media in childhood with aggression later in life, including physical assaults and spouse abuse. Because extremely violent criminal behaviors (e.g., forcible rape, aggravated assault, homicide) are rare, new longitudinal studies with larger samples are needed to estimate accurately how much habitual childhood exposure to media violence increases the risk for extreme violence. Well-supported theory delineates why and when exposure to media violence increases aggression and violence. Media violence produces short-term increases by priming existing aggressive scripts and cognitions, increasing physiological arousal, and triggering an automatic tendency to imitate observed behaviors. Media violence produces long-term effects via several types of learning processes leading to the acquisition of lasting (and automatically accessible) aggressive scripts, interpretational schemas, and aggression-supporting beliefs about social behavior, and by reducing individuals' normal negative emotional responses to violence (i.e., desensitization). Certain characteristics of viewers (e.g., identification with aggressive characters), social environments (e.g., parental influences), and media content (e.g., attractiveness of the perpetrator) can influence the degree to which media violence affects aggression, but there are some inconsistencies in research results. This research also suggests some avenues for preventive intervention (e.g., parental supervision, interpretation, and control of children's media use). However, extant research on moderators suggests that no one is wholly immune to the effects of media violence. Recent surveys reveal an extensive presence of violence in modern media. Furthermore, many children and youth spend an inordinate amount of time consuming violent media. Although it is clear that reducing exposure to media violence will reduce aggression and violence, it is less clear what sorts of interventions will produce a reduction in exposure. The sparse research literature suggests that counterattitudinal and parental-mediation interventions are likely to yield beneficial effects, but that media literacy interventions by themselves are unsuccessful. Though the scientific debate over whether media violence increases aggression and violence is essentially over, several critical tasks remain. Additional laboratory and field studies are needed for a better understanding of underlying psychological processes, which eventually should lead to more effective interventions. Large-scale longitudinal studies would help specify the magnitude of media-violence effects on the most severe types of violence. Meeting the larger societal challenge of providing children and youth with a much healthier media diet may prove to be more difficult and costly, especially if the scientific, news, public policy, and entertainment communities fail to educate the general public about the real risks of media-violence exposure to children and youth.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-1842606455

UNaV was measured hourly, whereas systolic BP and diastolic BP measurements were obtained at 15-minute intervals, and averaged for each 1-hour period. Results: There was no significant difference between the lean and overweight/obese group for the response of systolic BP and diastolic BP (group by time interaction, p = 0.60 and p = 0.64, respectively).

Asynchronous methods of Polyphonic C# play two major roles in MC#: 1) as autonomous methods executed on remote machines, and 2) as methods used for delivering messages. The former are identified in MC# as the ""movable methods"", and the latter form a special syntactic class with the elements named ""channels"". Similar to Polyphonic C#, chords are used for defining the channels and as a synchronization mechanism. The MC# channels are generalised naturally to ""bidirectional channels"", which may be used both for sending and receiving messages in the movable methods. The runtime-system of MC# has as the basic operation a copying operation for the object which is scheduled for execution on remote machine. This copy is ""dead"" after the movable method has finished its work, and all changes of this remote copy are not transferred to the original object. Arguments of the movable method are copied together with an original object, but the passing of bidirectional channels is realised through transferring the proxies for such channels. By way of experiments in MC#, we have written a series of parallel programs such as a computation of Fibonacci numbers, walking through binary tree, computation of primes by Eratosthenes sieve, calculation of Mandelbrot set, modeling the Conway's game ""Life"", etc. In all these cases, we got the easy readable and compact code.

Based on the experiences of this unfortunate accident from famous animation program ""Pocket Monster"", this study focused on the psychology and psychosomatics of the patients. A head-mounted display was used as the three-dimensional image presentation device and ""Descent"", a free software shooting game, was used as the software. Ten healthy adult male volunteers were used in this experiment after obtaining their informed consent. The oxygen metabolic change in the anterior lobe of the brain was measured by near infrared spectroscopy and recorded on an electrocardiogram. The mental scaling tendency of the object was analyzed using the type A behavior pattern and the hostility scaling. The Cook and Medley hostility (HO) scale from the Minnesota multiphasic personality inventory (MMPI) was also used in this experiment. From this scaling methodology, the paranoid scale, cynicism scale, lie scale, social support quality and social support quantity were calculated. All measured time series data were kept in the normal range, and no fatal arrhythmia or epilepsy were observed during experiments. In some cases, the brain oxygen metabolism may completely differ for the objects of Type A and Type B behavior patterns. On the whole, correlation did not become significant in type A scaling and hostility scaling. In a comparison of the percent changes of the HF in HRV with lie scaling, significant negative correlation was observed. The social support quantity was calculated from Cook and Medley, and significant negative correlations were observed with percent changes of LF/HF in HRV. The lie scale and social support quantity are opposite scaling. The sympathetic nervous system and parasympathetic nervous system have an opposite function also. Therefore, our results showed an interesting phenomenon, when considering the relationship between the autonomic function and the pathophysiological reaction to the audiovisual stimulations. As for the photo sensitive epilepsy, it was reported to be only 5-10% for all patients. Therefore, 90% or more of the cause could not be determined in patients who started a morbid response. The results in this study suggest that the autonomic function was connected to the mental tendency of the objects. By examining such directivity, it is expected that subjects, which show morbid reaction to an audiovisual stimulation, can be screened beforehand. © 2003 Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.

The aim of the study was to establish which anthropometric characteristics, physical abilities and psycho-physiological properties determine the success of adolescent female volleyballers at competitions. Methods. For this purpose we studied 32 female volleyballers aged 13-16 years. The anthropometric examination included 43 measurements, 7 tests of physical fitness, and 4 series of computerised psycho-physiological tests (n=21). The Performance of game elements was measured empirically during championship games using the original computer program ""Game"". Results. The proficiency of performing volleyball elements-serve, reception, feint, block and spike - was calculated by regression models from the 14 anthropometric measurements, 4 physical fitness and 7 psychophysiological test results, which showed significant correlation with proficiency in the game. The predictive power of the models was at least 32 % and in average 56%. The anthropometric factor was significant in the performance of all the elements of the game, being most essential (71-83 %) for attack, block and feint. Good results in physical ability tests granted success in serve, attack and reception. Conclusion. It was possible to predict the efficiency of reception (44 %) by endurance, flexibility and speed measuring tests. Medicine ball throwing test was essential for attack (22%). Psycho-physiological tests were significant for the performance of block (98 %), attack (80 %), feint (60 %) and reception (39 %).",14625509,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0345169110

After a few sessions, within some weeks, 4 young paraplegic patients learned to control the BCI. In accordance with the participants, decision-speed (trial length) was varied and the information transfer rate (ITR) was calculated for each run. All experimental runs have been feedback-runs employing a simple computer-game-like paradigm. A falling ball had to be led into a randomly marked target halfway down the screen. The horizontal position was controlled by the BCI-output signal and the trial length was varied by the investigator across runs. The goal was to find values for trial length enabling a maximum ITR. Three out of 4 participants had good results after a few runs. Analysis of their last 2 experimental sessions, each containing between 10 and 16 runs, showed that the trial length can be reduced to values around 2 s to obtain the highest possible information transfer.

Methods: Heart rate (HR) and blood pressure, as well as stroke volume, total peripheral resistance, rate pressure product, and cardiac contractility response in 15 aerobically trained (10.3 yr) and 15 untrained (9.5 yr) subjects during and recovering from the Stroop task and a computer game (Tetris) were examined. Cardiac vagal activity was also assessed using time series analysis of heart period variability (HPVts). Results: Untrained compared with trained subjects made significantly more errors during Stroop, whereas performance on Tetris was similar. Trained subjects had significantly lower (P &lt; 0.05) HR and significantly greater cardiac vagal activity at rest. Both groups had significant increases in HR, peripheral resistance, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, rate pressure product, and a significant decrease in vagal activity during Stroop. In contrast, only diastolic blood pressure increased and vagal activity decreased during Tetris. Cardiac contractility of both groups failed to increase during either stressor. Trained compared with untrained subjects had significantly lower absolute HR during and recovering from Stroop. Also HR and vagal activity change, relative to baseline, was significantly greater for the trained during Stroop. During and recovering from Tetris, absolute HR was significantly less for the trained subjects, but change scores were not significantly different.

Use of mobile phones is very popular in Japan, and frequent ringing is a common and intrusive part of Japanese life. Atopic eczema/dermatitis syndrome is often exacerbated by stress. Stress increases serum IgE levels, skews cytokine pattern towards Th2 type, enhances allergen-induced skin wheal responses, and triggers mast cell degranulation via substance P, vasoactive intestinal peptide and nerve growth factor. Materials and methods: (1) In the video game study, normal subjects (n = 25), patients with allergic rhinitis (n = 25) or atopic eczema/dermatitis syndrome (n = 25) played a video game (STREET FIGHTER II) for 2 h. Before and after the study, allergen-induced wheal responses, plasma levels of substance P, vasoactive intestinal peptide and nerve growth factor, and in vitro production of total IgE, antihouse dust mite IgE and cytokines were measured. (2) In the mobile phone study, normal subjects (n = 27), patients with allergic rhinitis (n = 27) or atopic eczema/dermatitis syndrome (n = 27) were exposed to 30 incidences of ringing mobile phones during 30 min. Before and after the study, allergen-induced wheal responses, plasma levels of substance P, vasoactive intestinal peptide and nerve growth factor were measured. Results: Playing video games had no effect on the normal subjects or the patients with allergic rhinitis. In contrast, playing video games significantly enhanced allergen-induced skin wheal responses and increased plasma levels of substance P, vasoactive intestinal peptide and nerve growth factors in the patients with atopic eczema/dermatitis syndrome. Moreover, playing video games enhanced in vitro production of total IgE and anti-house dust mite IgE with concomitant increased production of IL-4, IL-10 and IL-13 and decreased production of IFN-γ and IL-12 in the patients with atopic eczema/dermatitis syndrome. However, exposure to frequently ringing mobile phones significantly enhanced allergen-induced skin wheal responses, plasma levels of substance P, vasoactive intestinal peptide and nerve growth factors in the patients with atopic eczema/dermatitis syndrome, but not in the normal subjects or the patients with allergic rhinitis. Conclusion: Playing video games enhanced allergic responses with a concomitant increased release of substance P, vasoactive intestinal peptide and nerve growth factor, and skewing of the cytokine pattern toward Th2 type in the patients with atopic eczema/dermatitis syndrome. In addition, exposure to frequently ringing mobile phones also enhanced allergic responses with a concomitant increased release of substance P, vasoactive intestinal peptide and nerve growth factor Collectively, high technology causes stress, which in turn may aggravate symptoms of atopic eczema/dermatitis syndrome.",12795649,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037899549

The interactive robot soccer game has been developed to allow humans to join into the game dynamically and reinforce entertainment characteristics. In order to make these games more interesting, a cooperation strategy between humans and autonomous robots on a team is very important. Strategies can be pre-programmed or learned by robots themselves with learning or evolving algorithms. Since the robot soccer system is hard to model and its environment changes dynamically, it is very difficult to pre-program cooperation strategies between robot agents. Q-learning - one of the most representative reinforcement learning methods - is shown to be effective for solving problems dynamically without explicit knowledge of the system. Therefore, in our research, a Q-learning based learning method has been utilized. Prior to utilizing Q-learning, state variables describing the game situation and actions' sets of robots have been defined. After the learning process, the human operator could play the game more easily. To evaluate the usefulness of the proposed strategy, some simulations and games have been carried out.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-4544289438

Thirty three patients with Parkinson's disease and 20 patients with hemiparesis after cerebrovascular accidents in the MCA participated in the investigation. The subjects stood on a force platform and in the form of a computer game were trained to match the projection of the center of pressure (a cursor) with a target on the screen under the visual feedback control. Two different postural tasks were presented. In the first task the direction of the center-of-pressure shift was not known before, so the subject learned the general strategy of the center-pressure control. In the other task a precise postural coordination should be formed. The voluntary control of the center-of-pressure position was found to be impaired in both groups of patients. In the task of moving the center of pressure in various directions (general strategy), no differences in the initial deficit of the task performance were found between the groups, but the learning was more efficient in the group of hemiparetic patients. However, in the task with precise postural coordination, despite the greater initial deficit in the parkinsonian patients, the learning in this group of patients was substantially more efficient than in hemiparetic patients.

To use the findings to plan training with greater precision. Methods: Eleven badminton players (mean (SD) age 21.8 (3.26) years) with international experience from four different countries (France, Italy, Spain, and Portugal) were studied. Two of the Spanish players were monitored in several matches, giving a total of 14 samples, all during the 1999 Spanish International Tournament. Blood lactate concentration was measured with a reflective photometer. Maximum and average heart rates were recorded with a heart rate monitor. Temporal structure and actions during the matches were determined from video recordings. All variables were measured during and after the game and later analysed using a descriptive study. Results: The results confirmed the high demands of the sport, with a maximum heart rate of 190.5 beats/min and an average of 173.5 beats/min during matches over 28 minutes long and performance intervals of 6.4 seconds and rest time of 12.9 seconds between exchanges.

An awareness of these characteristics, together with data on the correlations between certain actions such as unforced errors and winning shots and the final result of the match, will aid in more appropriate planning and monitoring of specific training.",12547746,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037311216

SenToy is an input device that allows the user to perform gestures or movements that the sensors inside the doll pick up. The gestures are interpreted according to a scheme found through two different user studies: one Wizard of Oz study and one study with a fully functioning SenToy. Different gestures express one of the following emotions: anger, fear, surprise, sadness, gloating and happiness. Depending upon the expressed emotion, the synthetic character in the game will, in turn, perform different actions (trading, duelling, etc.). The evaluation of SenToy acting as the interface to the computer game Fantasy A has shown that the users were able to express the desired emotions to influence the synthetic characters, and that overall players liked the doll as an interface. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Also, we present the first large-scale data mining experiment about the automatic recognition of basic emotions in informal everyday short utterances. We focus on the speaker-dependent problem. We compare a large set of machine learning algorithms, ranging from neural networks, Support Vector Machines or decision trees, together with 200 features, using a large database of several thousands examples. We show that the difference of performance among learning schemes can be substantial, and that some features which were previously unexplored are of crucial importance. An optimal feature set is derived through the use of a genetic algorithm. Finally, we explain how this study can be applied to real world situations in which very few examples are available.

The effects appear larger for milder than for more severe forms of aggression, but the effects on severe forms of violence are also substantial (r = 0.13 to 0.32) when compared with effects of other violence risk factors or medical effects deemed important by the medical community (e.g., effect of aspirin on heart attacks). The research base is large; diverse in methods, samples, and media genres; and consistent in overall findings. The evidence is clearest within the most extensively researched domain, television and film violence. The growing body of video-game research yields essentially the same conclusions. Short-term exposure increases the likelihood of physically and verbally aggressive behavior, aggressive thoughts, and aggressive emotions. Recent large-scale longitudinal studies provide converging evidence linking frequent exposure to violent media in childhood with aggression later in life, including physical assaults and spouse abuse. Because extremely violent criminal behaviors (e.g., forcible rape, aggravated assault, homicide) are rare, new longitudinal studies with larger samples are needed to estimate accurately how much habitual childhood exposure to media violence increases the risk for extreme violence. Well-supported theory delineates why and when exposure to media violence increases aggression and violence. Media violence produces short-term increases by priming existing aggressive scripts and cognitions, increasing physiological arousal, and triggering an automatic tendency to imitate observed behaviors. Media violence produces long-term effects via several types of learning processes leading to the acquisition of lasting (and automatically accessible) aggressive scripts, interpretational schemas, and aggression-supporting beliefs about social behavior, and by reducing individuals' normal negative emotional responses to violence (i.e., desensitization). Certain characteristics of viewers (e.g., identification with aggressive characters), social environments (e.g., parental influences), and media content (e.g., attractiveness of the perpetrator) can influence the degree to which media violence affects aggression, but there are some inconsistencies in research results. This research also suggests some avenues for preventive intervention (e.g., parental supervision, interpretation, and control of children's media use). However, extant research on moderators suggests that no one is wholly immune to the effects of media violence. Recent surveys reveal an extensive presence of violence in modern media. Furthermore, many children and youth spend an inordinate amount of time consuming violent media. Although it is clear that reducing exposure to media violence will reduce aggression and violence, it is less clear what sorts of interventions will produce a reduction in exposure. The sparse research literature suggests that counterattitudinal and parental-mediation interventions are likely to yield beneficial effects, but that media literacy interventions by themselves are unsuccessful. Though the scientific debate over whether media violence increases aggression and violence is essentially over, several critical tasks remain. Additional laboratory and field studies are needed for a better understanding of underlying psychological processes, which eventually should lead to more effective interventions. Large-scale longitudinal studies would help specify the magnitude of media-violence effects on the most severe types of violence. Meeting the larger societal challenge of providing children and youth with a much healthier media diet may prove to be more difficult and costly, especially if the scientific, news, public policy, and entertainment communities fail to educate the general public about the real risks of media-violence exposure to children and youth. © 2003, Association for Psychological Science.

This article describes the implementation and results of a psychophysical experiment suggesting that humans are susceptible to motion camouflage. The experiment masqueraded as a computer-game competition. The basis of the competition was a game designed to test the comparative success of different predatory-approach strategies. The experiment showed that predators were able to approach closer to their prey (the player of the game) before being detected when using motion camouflage than when using other approach strategies tested. For an autonomous predator, the calculation of a motion-camouflage approach is a non-trivial problem. It was, therefore, of particular interest that in the game the players were deceived by motion-camouflage predators controlled by artificial neural systems operating using realistic levels of input information. It is suggested that these results are especially of interest to biologists, visual psychophysicists, military engineers and computer-games designers.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0041529639

This results in a rock-scissors-paper type of cyclic dominance of the three strategies. In the prisoner’s dilemma, the effects of voluntary participation crucially depend on the underlying population structure. While leading to homogeneous states of all loners in well-mixed populations, we demonstrate that cyclic dominance produces self-organizing patterns on square lattices but leads to different types of oscillatory behavior on random regular graphs: the temptation to defect determines whether damped, periodic, or increasing oscillations occur. These Monte Carlo simulations are complemented by predictions from pair approximation reproducing the results for random regular graphs particularly well. © 2002 The American Physical Society.",12513331,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-37649032642

It was predicted that a preference for violent games would be associated with negative externalizing characteristics, in particular aggressive emotions and behaviors, on the Youth Self-Report (YSR), a standardized self-report measure of adolescent problem behaviors. Thirty-two 11- through 15-year-olds (17 girls) listed and categorized favorite electronic games into one of six predetermined categories and completed the YSR. MANOVA revealed significant relationships between a preference for violent games and the Thought Problems subscale (P < .01) and YSR Total Score (P < .05), with trends noted for the Internalizing (P < .06) and Anxious-Depressed (P < .08) subscales. Expected relationships with externalizing behaviors, including aggression, were not found. However, across all YSR subscales, children with higher preference for violent games had more clinically significant elevations than those with low preference for violent games. On the Total Problems subscale, of the eight children receiving scores in the clinically significant range, six were in the High preference group (three boys and three girls). The failure to find the expected relationships between a preference for violent games and aggressive, externalizing behaviors is puzzling. It is possible that individuals with a preference for violent games may have high exposure to all forms of media violence. Their perceptions of their own behavior, in comparison, may not seem sufficiently aggressive to justify endorsement of problems in this area. Or, playing violent electronic games may promote a disconnection between the emotions normally associated with violence and violent acts. These explanations are consistent with a desensitization model where exposure to media violence decreases sensitivity to aggression. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036108424

We present both simulation and experimental results of real pursuit-evasion games involving our fleet of UAVs and UGVs, and evaluate the pursuit policies relating expected capture times to the speed and intelligence of the evaders and the sensing capabilities of the pursuers.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036817348

Methods: Two hundred twenty-two adolescents (mean age = 18.5 ± 2.8 years; 130 [70 males] EAs and 92 [48 males] AAs) completed two stressors (video game, forehead cold). Hemodynamic measures and blood samples were collected at catheter insertion and before and immediately after the two stressors, separated by 20-minute rest periods. Results: AAs and males exhibited higher levels of SBP and DBP and of TPRI and ET-1 at each sampling point compared with EAs and females, respectively (p values < .001). AAs and males exhibited greater increases in SBP, TPRI, and ET-1 in response to each stressor (p values < .05). Intraindividual correlations between ET-1 and hemodynamic parameters revealed that most individuals exhibited a positive association between ET-1, BP, and TPRI. However, some individuals exhibited a negative association between ET-1 and the above-mentioned hemodynamics, suggesting a compensatory vasodilation mechanism.

Nor can it tell us much about the dynamics by which a population of players moves from one equilibrium to another. These limitations, along with concerns about the cognitive demands of forward-looking rationality, have motivated efforts to explore backward-looking alternatives to analytical game theory. Most of the effort has been invested in evolutionary models of population dynamics. We shift attention to a learning-theoretic alternative. Computational experiments with adaptive agents identify a fundamental solution concept for social dilemmas-stochastic collusion-based on a random walk from a self-limiting noncooperative equilibrium into a self-reinforcing cooperative equilibrium. However, we show that this solution is viable only within a narrow range of aspiration levels. Below the lower threshold, agents are pulled into a deficient equilibrium that is a stronger attractor than mutual cooperation. Above the upper threshold, agents are dissatisfied with mutual cooperation. Aspirations that adapt with experience (producing habituation to stimuli) do not gravitate into the window of viability; rather, they are the worst of both worlds. Habituation destabilizes cooperation and stabilizes defection. Results from the two-person problem suggest that applications to multiplex and embedded relationships will yield unexpected insights into the global dynamics of cooperation in social dilemmas.",12011402,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037076357

It is shown that a differential game guidance law derived using this time-varying model provides a significant improvement in the homing accuracy compared to a guidance law based on a model with constant velocities and lateral acceleration limits. Moreover, the time-varying linear model provides a much more accurate prediction of the miss distance, confirming its validity.

Agents are specialized software programs that can move autonomously between supporting platforms. Agents can be used to model the preferences of users wishing to buy or sell items on a global marketplace. Users can select a number of options that will guide the agents in their quest for an optimal trade. Besides the price range, users can determine the way in which the agents will bargain, thus fine-tuning the tradeoffs involved in deciding whether a price in the price range requires further negotiation or is acceptable. The simulation developed is realized entirely in Java, and takes advantage of TEEMA, an extensible, general-purpose mobile agent execution environment, dedicated to the purpose of exploring the capabilities of mobile agents. TEEMA has been realized to provide a testbed for agent applications without having to be limited by proprietary application suites or inaccessible low-level interfaces. It is completely configurable and easily extensible as it is built around a microkernel that supports primitive agent operations and a set of services that provide high-level agent support. The paper starts with the description of the infrastructure necessary to define a marketplace as a combination of service agents. Then, trader agents are explained. The simulation environment is then introduced, and analyzed. The architecture emerging from the simulation environment is then examined, together with its advantages and disadvantages. Finally, the simulation parameters are presented. An analysis of the results shows that the simulation environment can provide a suitable platform for economic simulation based on empirical analysis or more formal systems such as game theory. An example of asymmetric transaction is presented where it is shown that trades are influenced by the agent initiating the transaction.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036062758

Then, we introduce a multi-level concept for an experimental stage that can be used to explore interactive storytelling at varying degrees of flexibility versus predetermination. Instead of inventing the ultimate virtual narrator, we suggest developing layers of run-time engines that allow authors to work with directions on each single layer separately - from selecting high-level dramatic structures down to directing animated actors.

Innovations made here are: (1) a design for a generic simulator package for promoting health behavior shifts, and (2) algorithms for animated pedagogical agents to reason about how their emotional state ties to patient condition and user progress. Initial results show that users of the game exhibit a significant shift in intention to call 9-1-1 and avoid delay, that multi-media versions of the game foster vividness and memory retention as well as a better understanding of both symptoms and of the need to manage time during a heart attack event.

When we try to apply the technique to a practical problem, however, the slowness of learning due to the increased number of states becomes a bottleneck. We try to speed up learning by reducing the effective number of states by coarse-graining of perceptions at the early stage of learning, and at the same time try to ensure the overall performance by switching back to complete perception later. By only switching the perception granularity, however, it is difficult to rectify bad habits acquired at the early stage of learning.

Using the affect infusion model (AIM), this study aimed to assess the impact of prior mood on gaming persistence in regular and non-regular gamblers (assumed to be motivated and heuristic decision-makers, respectively). Design, measures and setting. A 2 × 3 experimental design in a laboratory setting employed factors of gambler type (regular, non-regular) and prior mood (happy, neutral, depressed). Measures were number of trials played on a gambling game, and mood ratings (post-mood induction, during and after play). Participants and intervention. Sixty regular and 60 non-regular gamblers (all male students) were assigned randomly to watch a video inducing one of the three mood conditions. They were then given AUD$10.00 to gamble in a computerized card-cutting game. Findings. AIM predictions were supported: prior mood did not affect gaming persistence for regular gamblers, but non-regulars showed reduced persistence across happy, neutral and depressed moods. After-play mood ratings were related to winnings for regulars, and losing regulars were significantly more unhappy after-play compared to during-play, and compared to both their winning counterparts and non-regulars. Mood and winnings were unrelated for non-regulars, with little during- to after-play mood change. Conclusions. The findings speak to depression as a causal factor in addictive gambling. Depressed mood did not enhance persistence in regular gamblers, but rather failed to have the inhibitory effect observed in non-regular gamblers.

Maximal oxygen consumption and anaerobic threshold were determined in ten players. Materials and methods - Then each subject played a match for approximately two hours. Ventilatory flow, oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations and heart rate (HR) were measured continuously and oxygen consumption was determined with a portable telemetric ergospirometry system. A video camera was set simultaneously to film the player. Results - Mean V̇O2 reached approximately 60% of the V̇O2 max for 80% of the duration of the match. During the points, HR varied from 70 to 95% of maxHR and decreased rapidly during the changes of side. The evolution of the V̇O2 was similar. The mean V̇O2 was identical to that estimated from the HR measured in the field and the HR/V̇O2 relationship determined at the laboratory. Conclusion - Despite the intermittent nature of the game, tennis induces a moderate but long aerobic expenditure and the HR measured in the field remains a good indicator of the level of the aerobic expenditure. © 2001 éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.",,"English; French",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-18844478180

Design: The influences of ethnicity and socioeconomic status (SES) on cardiovascular function were evaluated at rest and in response to five different laboratory stressors. Methods: 110 (50 female) Caucasian and 162 (85 female) African-American normotensive youth (initial age 11.2 ± 2.4 years) with a family history of essential hypertension (EH) were tested on two occasions, an average of 2.5 years apart. Based on previous findings, it was predicted that African Americans, particularly those of low SES, would exhibit higher resting blood pressure (BP) and greater cardiovascular reactivity to acute laboratory stressors than would Caucasians. Results: As predicted, African-American youth exhibited higher resting diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and total peripheral resistance (TPR) than Caucasians on both visits (both Ps<.04). African Americans exhibited greater systolic blood pressure (SBP) reactivity than did Caucasians to the video game stressor during both lab visits (both Ps<.02) and greater heart rate reactivity during the first lab visit (P<.01). African Americans exhibited greater SBP and/or DBP, and TPR reactivity to the cold pressor during the first lab visit and the parent-child discussion during the second visit (all Ps<.03). Conclusion: As predicted, African Americans exhibited higher resting BP and TPR, and greater cardiovascular reactivity than Caucasians. Although not in the predicted direction, a pattern of interactions began to emerge on the second evaluation. For example, upper SES youth exhibited greater heart rate reactivity compared to all other groups on the social competence interview and parent-child discussion stressors.

It consists of quantum recurrent nets generating stochastic processes which represent the motor dynamics, and of classical neural nets describing evolution of probabilities of these processes which represent the mental dynamics. The autonomy of the decision making process is achieved by a feedback from mental to motor dynamics which changes the stochastic matrix based upon the probability distributions. This feedback replaces an unavailable external information by an internal knowledgebase stored in the mental model in the form of probability distributions. As a result, the coupled motor-mental dynamics is described by a nonlinear version of Markov chains which can decrease entropy without an external source of information.

We found that psychosomatic symptoms were increasing with age. This study was designed to investigate psychosocial factors responsible for increasing psychosomatic symptoms with age. Methods: We calculated a correlation coefficient between the physical complaints score (PCS) and these psychosocial variables using quantitation I of multiple regression analysis separately in the older (10-12 years, n = 860) and the younger age group (7-9 years, n = 759). Results: A stronger relationship between PCS and psychosocial problems was found in the older (r = 0.719, P < 0.0001) than in the younger age group (r=0.570, P < 0.0001). Further analysis demonstrated that difficulties in school performance and increasing psychological conflicts with human relationships were major causes of somatic complaints in the older age group. In the younger age group, however, immaturity of social skills seems to be a primary problem. In addition, poor parental interaction and the playing of computer games were found to increase somatic complaints in children. Conclusion: Children in the older age reflect the closer bio-psycho-socio interaction compared with their younger counterparts. This may give rise to a high incidence of psychosomatic disorders and school refusal in Japanese children.

In this article, they analyze the components of attention management through three lenses--economic, psychobiological, and technological--and offer guidelines for keeping employees focused on crucial corporate tasks. Their lessons are drawn from the best practices employed by today's stickiest Web sites and by traditional attention industries such as advertising, film, and television. The authors say executives must manage attention knowing that it's a zero-sum game (there's only so much to go around). Managers should also consider capitalizing on the basic survival and competitive instincts we all have that help determine how much attention we pay to certain things. For instance, the threat of corporate demise--and the consequent loss of jobs and livelihoods--undoubtedly focuses workers' attention on the need to change. Likewise, internal competition among business units may give employees added incentive to pay attention to a profit or sales goal.

The model, based on play techniques, consists of five weekly meetings of 8-10 families, with children's and parents' groups held simultaneously, coordinated by specially trained teachers and outside the hospital environment. Children are trained to assume a leading role in the management of their health; parents learn to be facilitators; and physicians provide guidance, acting as counselors. Group activities include games, drawings, stories, videos, and role-playing. Children and parents were interviewed at home before the program and 6 and 12 months after the program, and medical and school records were monitored for emergency and routine visits, hospitalizations, and school absenteeism. In asthma and epilepsy, children in the experiment showed significant improvements in knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors compared to controls (probability of experimental gain over controls = .69 for epilepsy and .56 for asthma, with σ2 = .007 and .016, respectively). Parent participants in the experiment had improved knowledge of asthma (39% before vs. 58% after) and epilepsy (22% before vs. 56% after), with a probability of gain = .62 (σ2 = .0026) with respect to the control group.

However, it is unclear how these neurochemical events affect cognition, especially attention. We examined the effects of mild psychological stress on selective attention, as assessed by the negative priming (NP) paradigm. Salivary measures of the stress hormone CORT and α-amylase (a correlate of NE) were assayed to probe the relationship between the stress response and attentional inhibition. Healthy subjects (N=20) engaged in the attention task, which was then followed by 15 min of a stressful video game before a return to the attentional task. Baseline saliva samples were obtained before the experiment began, 1 min after the video-game stressor, and 20 min post-stress. Subjects showed a significant reduction in NP and a decrease in reaction time (RT) after the video game. Moreover, α-amylase levels increased significantly after the stressor, indicating the role of NE in the acute stress response. While CORT levels remained unchanged after stress, CORT correlated significantly with both NP scores and RT after the stressor. These results imply that mild psychological stress can significantly alter attentional processes. Given the increase in α-amylase and the correlation between attention and CORT after stress, it seems likely that attentional processes are under tight control by brain systems which mediate the fight-or-flight response.

Because this probability is conditioned to distinct observations for each team, the resulting game is nonzero-sum. When the evader has access to the pursuers' information, we show that a Nash solution to the one-step nonzero-sum game always exists.

Seven trained games players (age 21.5 ± 0.9 years, height 182 ± 2 cm, body mass 80.1 ± 3.6 kg, (Formula Presented) 59.0 ± 1.9 ml·kg-1·min-1; mean ± sx) performed the test on two occasions (Trial 1 and Trial 2), at least 7 days apart, to determine the test–retest reliability of the sprint times and running capacity. The physiological and metabolic responses on both occasions were also monitored. The par ticipants ingested water ad libitum during the first trial, and were then prescribed the same amount of water during the second trial. The 15 m sprint times during Trials 1 and 2 averaged 2.42 ± 0.04 s and 2.43 ± 0.04 s, respectively. Run time during Part B was 6.3 ± 2.0 min for Trial 1 and 6.1 ± 1.3 min for Trial 2. The 95% limits of agreement for sprint times and run times during Part B were –0.14 to 0.12 s and –3.19 to 2.16 min respectively. There were no differences between trials for hear t rate, rating of perceived exertion, body mass change during exercise, or blood lactate and glucose concentrations during the test. Thus, we conclude that the sprint times and the Part B run times were reproducible within the limits previously stated.

Each seller offers the good or service at a fixed level of 'quality', and attempts to set its price in such a way that it maximizes its own profit. Five different seller pricing strategies, ranging widely from ones that require perfect knowledge and unlimited computational power to ones that require very little knowledge or computational capability, are employed in two different buyer populations. The resulting collective dynamics are studied using a combination of analysis and simulation. In a population of quality-sensitive buyers, all pricing strategies lead to a price equilibrium predicted by a game-theoretic analysis. However, in a population of price-sensitive buyers, most pricing strategies lead to large-amplitude cyclical price wars. The circumstances under which cyclical price wars occur can be explained in terms of the topology of an underlying 'profit landscape' [J.O. Kephart, J.E. Hanson, J.

This domain of research requires developments in three main areas. First, without any feedback informationfrom the environment, there is no way for robots to achieve some tasks autonomously. Fortunately, the quadruped 'Sony' prototypes on which all experiments are carried out are equipped with an enhanced visionsystem; thanks to its CCD camera located in its head, the robot can obtain color images of the scene around it. Extracting relevant information from the images captured is not easy since it must be doneonboard in real time. Moreover, image treatment procedures should have high process rates for the robot to react quickly in front of unexpected events. A special vision module composed of three parts hasbeen designed for these purposes. The second point to focus on is the walking ability of the robot. Quadrupeds are designed to move efficiently and rapidly on flat ground. The objective of the walking moduleis to generate appropriate walking patterns allowing the machine to walk in the desired direction. Walking gaits are produced like reflexes by the robot itself to adapt to the situation. With regard tothe design of these gaits, emphasis has been put on increasing speed and mastering transitions. Finally, the machine should be given a minimum of intelligence since it has to manage vision information andits walking gaits by itself. When involved in situations of cooperation or competition or both, like in a soccer game, a high-level supervision task is welcome. This paper presents detailed developmentsof these three points and describes how they are implemented on a real robot. © 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033698614

Traditional habilitation recommends the use of single switch control and simple computer games as pre-training of cause-effect relationships and joystick control before training in use of a powered wheelchair. Findings from studies of individuals at an early developmental level driving a powered wheelchair suggest it may be more effective to reverse order. Methods. We studied the outcome of powered wheelchair activity in context (self-directed locomotion). Participants included 40 disabled individuals and 17 typically developed infants functioning at an early developmental level. The activity in the wheelchair was paralleled with the use of single switch controls connected both to toys and to a computer with simple 'press-action' software. Results. The cognitive understanding of the simple cause-effect (use of joystick causes the effect of motion of the wheelchair) developed earlier than the understanding (press on single switch causes activation of toy or apparatus). Conclusion. The recommendation to use single switch controls as pre-training for driving a powered wheelchair corresponds with individuals with quite good cognitive function but not with individuals who function at an early developmental level. For individuals with severe or profound mental retardation the possibilities to understand cause-effect relationships are found in tools that affect all their senses, their whole body. A powered wheelchair is such a tool. When the individual activates the joystick, the wheelchair moves, affecting all senses and the individual's position in space. This event provides arousal, interest and motivation to further manipulate and explore the cause of the effect.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033500452

The parti-game multiresolution learning approach is applied for simultaneous and cooperative construction of a world model, and learning to navigate through an obstacle-free path from a starting position to a known goal region. The paper introduces a new approach, based on the application of the fuzzy ART neural architecture, for on-line map building from actual sensor data. This method is then integrated, as a complement, on the parti-game world model, allowing the system to make a more efficient use of collected sensor information. Then, a predictive on-line trajectory filtering method, is introduced in the learning approach. Instead of having a mechanical device moving to search the world, the idea is to have the system analyzing trajectories in a predictive mode, by taking advantage of the improved world model. The real robot will only move to try trajectories that have been predicted to be successful, allowing lower exploration costs. This results in an overall improved new method for goal-oriented navigation. It is assumed that the robot knows its own current world location - a simple dead-reckoning method is used for localization in our experiments. It is also assumed that the robot is able to perform sensor-based obstacle detection (not avoidance) and straight-line motions. Results of experiments with a real Nomad 200 mobile robot will be presented, demonstrating the effectiveness of the discussed methods.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033116870

Methods: Participants ranged in age from 11 to 14 years at baseline, in 1992 to 1993, and 14 to 18 years at follow-up in 1996. Video game BP reactivity was defined as the residual score of the regression of the maximum BP during the video game on the minimum resting BP before the video game. The predictive effect of baseline video game BP reactivity on follow-up resting BP was tested using regression models with baseline resting BP, baseline body mass index (BMI), and age as covariates. Results: Systolic BP reactivity to the video game at baseline was significantly, p = .04, and independently associated with resting systolic BP 3 to 4 years later. Samoan adolescent who had higher systolic BP reactivity scores at baseline had significantly higher resting systolic BP at follow-up after adjustment for the significant effects of baseline resting systolic BP, age, and BMI. There were no interactions between sex and reactivity or between residence, American Samoa or (Western) Samoa, and reactivity in the models, indicating that the effects of systolic BP reactivity in early adolescence on later adolescent resting systolic BP were similar in the entire study sample. Conclusions: Video game cardiovascular reactivity seems to assess aspects of psychophysiological arousal and prospective CVD risk in Samoan adolescent of both sexes residing in both Samoas, and may be useful for understanding the role of psychosocial stress and health in modernizing societies.",10204978,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032923509

The stimulus products were a computer game and grammar-checking software. Forty-two college students comprised the sample for the experiment. The specific affective responses studied are pleasure and arousal, and brand cognitions are represented as the expectancy value from brand attributes (the product of brand beliefs, belief confidence, and attribute evaluations, summed across the attributes (Σ biciei)). The relative level and influence of affective and cognitive responses to a product trial were shown to differ significantly, depending on whether the product was hedonic or functional in nature. Specifically, for the hedonic product, felt arousal during the trial was higher than for the functional product, and emotional responses were significant antecedents of subjects' evaluations of the trial experience. Brand cognitions, however, were not significantly related to trial evaluations for the hedonic product. In contrast, for the functional product, brand cognitions and pleasure were significant antecedents of trial evaluations, but arousal was not. The findings of this study demonstrate the importance of considering both the cognitive structure created by a product trial and the consumer's emotional reactions to the trial. For hedonic products, especially, emotional responses to the trial were shown to be powerful antecedents to consumers' evaluations of a trial experience, and subsequently, brand attitude. Marketers and marketing researchers can use these results to predict which category of responses to product trial (affective or cognitive) will be most important for brand evaluation for the particular product in question.

Newspapers and television announce discussions between politicians and policymakers. Scientists however, free from the political tide, are researching families in an attempt to discover the true developments. In this paper, an account is given of research into the family, upbringing and leisure. The study was carried out for the third time in the south of the Netherlands, in the towns of Arkel and Kedichem. In 1960, the research involved the modem Western family, while in 1972 the plastic family was registered. The third study had the task of getting empirical evidence to support the new family type. The first two studies were virtually identical in set-up, whereas the third study was very different because the questions asked before proved impossible to duplicate. Moreover, the third study consisted of three main themes: general family aspects, family and upbringing, and family and leisure. The content of the paper has mainly to do with the first and third themes. Structured interviews were conducted with 331 mothers who had at least one child aged between 0 and 18. The study illustrated the existence of three family types in rural areas in the Netherlands- the modem Western (contemporary: traditional), the transitional, and the postmodem family with its subtle leaning toward the value of leisure in the family. The general family typology demonstrates that in rural areas in the Netherlands in the late eighties/early nineties, 21% of the families were characterised as modem Western (traditional), 64% as transitional, and 15% as postrnodem. Viewed from the family leisure typology angle, these percentages show up as 54%, 34% and 12%: the family leisure typology scores are more conservative than those of the general family typology. The themes under the general family sociological denominator deal with opinions on: sex-specific task division, say in the family; independence in the marriage relation; the institution of marriage; and motherhood. Under the theme family and leisure what was sought were opinions about: task division in leisure time, definition of leisure time, togetherness in leisure time, freedom given to the partner, gender-specific upbringing during leisure time, the importance of television and games, and autonomy of the children in their free time. The results of the study have been examined against the background of individualization. The discussions relate to beliefs such as ""moral responsibility""'(Bauman, 1993), ""pure relationship"" (Giddens, 1991), ""the morphogenetic family versus the morphostatic family"" (Scanzoni, 1983) and ""the associative versus the hyperindividualistic family"" (Te Kloeze, 1989; 1996). © Presses de l'Université du Québec.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033478914

In this article, we introduce periodic team synchronization (PTS) domains as time-critical environments in which agents act autonomously with low communication, but in which they can periodically synchronize in a full-communication setting. The two main contributions of this article are a flexible team agent structure and a method for inter-agent communication. First, the team agent structure allows agents to capture and reason about team agreements. We achieve collaboration between agents through the introduction of formations. A formation decomposes the task space defining a set of roles. Homogeneous agents can flexibly switch roles within formations, and agents can change formations dynamically, according to predefined triggers to be evaluated at run-time. This flexibility increases the performance of the overall team. Our teamwork structure further includes pre-planning for frequently occurring situations. Second, the communication method is designed for use during the low-communication periods in PTS domains. It overcomes the obstacles to inter-agent communication in multi-agent environments with unreliable, single-channel, high-cost, low-bandwidth communication. We fully implemented both the flexible teamwork structure and the communication method in the domain of simulated robotic soccer, and conducted controlled empirical experiments to verify their effectiveness. In addition, our simulator team made it to the semi-finals of the RoboCup-97 competition, in which 29 teams participated. It achieved a total score of 67-9 over six different games, and successfully demonstrated its flexible teamwork structure and inter-agent communication.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033149662

Department of Gastroenterology, Royal Free Hospital, London. ■ Subjects: Forty patients with irritable bowel syndrome refractory to conventional medical treatment. ■ Main outcome measures: Development of a computer aided biofeedback apparatus directed at the gut for teaching relaxation to patients with irritable bowel syndrome. The patients' ability to complete a computer game involving biofeedback modulated by a physiological loop that related changes in stress (monitored by electrodermal activity) to animated computer graphics. The degree to which deep relaxation was achieved was measured numerically by a progressive reduction in the sensitivity level of the biofeedback loop. The success of relaxation in ameliorating physical symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome was assessed by daily diaries in which global and weighted bowel symptom scores were entered. ■ Results: A computer biofeedback game based on animated gut imagery was successfully developed. Most patients learned to achieve progressively deeper levels of relaxation after four 30 minute biofeedback sessions (mean difference in sensitivity level 2.0 (95% confidence interval 0.96 to 2.93), p<0.001).

At long term follow up, 64% of patients who had been helped by dosed relaxation continued to use the technique, although they had had no further contact with the hospital. ■ Conclusions: This computer biofeedback game taught deep relaxation rapidly and effectively.

Several authors reported that video games tended to increase breathing frequency (i.e. to reduce breath duration), whereas others reported the opposite. We postulated that video games contain different psychophysiological components which may have opposite effects on breathing pattern. On the one hand, arousal and emotion may tend to stimulate breathing. On the other, focusing attention on the game may prompt subject to inhibit any movement - including breathing - which might be a potential nuisance variable. The aim of this study was to assess the specific effects of the attentional load in an experimental environment characterized by its low emotional impact. We measured breathing variables, cardiac frequency and cortisol levels in 10 healthy children (mean age = 9.2 ±: 1.5 years) who were familiar with the environment, the experimenter and the video game. Breath duration rose significantly, from 2.56 to 3.16 s, as a function of game difficulty. Cortisol levels, heart rate and the thoracic contribution to breathing displayed no significant changes. Taken together, these data suggest that focusing attention on the game tended to inhibit breathing and that previous contradictory reports in this respect were due to the confounding effects of emotion.",9641244,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031779362

In previous work, we found that urinary cGMP was inversely related to diastolic BP, but cGMP levels were higher among individuals presumed to have increased adrenergic activity, increased reactivity, and increased risk of hypertension (blacks, individuals with a family history of hypertension). Method: We measured 24-hour urinary cGMP levels in a substudy of 529 individuals in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study; the sample was 23 to 35 years of age and approximately balanced for race (black/white) and gender. BP reactivity to stressors (video game, star-tracing, cold pressor) was tested 3 years earlier. Baseline BP was included as a covariate in all analyses. Results: Diastolic BP reactivity to cold pressor was inversely related to cGMP excretion (p < .05); the relationship was strongest among black women with a family history of hypertension (partial r = -.33, p < .01). Systolic BP reactivity to star-tracing was also inversely related to cGMP (p < .01); the relationship for both star-tracing and video game stressors was strongest among black men (partial r values = -.25 and -.24, respectively; p values < .01).

The purpose of the current cross- sectional study was to determine the variation in propulsion technique in association with sprint power production among elite wheelchair athletes. Therefore, 67 wheelchair athletes (different impairment; 17 female and 50 male athletes; age, 29.1 ± 7 yr; body weight, 60.7 ± 11.8 kg; training hours, 12.9 ± 6.4 h · wk-1; VO2 (peak) 1.7 ± 0.7 liter · min-1; aerobic power output, 72.2 ± 36.7 W) were studied during the World Championships and Games for the Disabled in Assen (1990) on propulsion technique and anaerobic work capacity in a 30-s sprint test on a computer controlled wheelchair ergometer. Mean power output (P30) (97 ± 45.8 w; range, 8.3-195.3 W) and heart rate (158.6 ± 23.6 b · min-1) were highly variable and seemed associated with impairment level: track athletes, classified in four different functional classes, showed a class-related P30 of 23, 68, 100, and 138 W for the male athletes (n = 38). Sprint power relative to body weight varied between 0.36 W · kg BW-1 ± 0.04 and 1.85 W · kg BW-1 ± 0.43 for the different subject groups. Propulsion technique in terms of forces applied to the rim and timing showed significant differences between subject groups for the majority of parameters studied. Apart from the mediolateral force and the negative dip at the start of the push phase, the technique parameters were significantly related to power production. Fraction effective force, the ratio between the total force vector and the effective force applied to the hand rim, appeared low on average (especially for subjects with cerebral palsy and those with a high spinal lesion) but showed a significant correlation with power output (r = 0.5). In general, propulsion technique parameters were related to both performance and functionality. The number of training hours showed a small but significant relation with peak power (r = 0.31), peak torque (r = 0.4), the amount of work per push (r = 0.41) and total force vector (r = 0.31), stressing the role of training status, next to disability, as important mediating factor in both propulsion technique as well as performance capacity. No association between training hours and fraction effective force was seen. It can be concluded that propulsion technique and performance parameters are highly variable among wheelchair athletes. Also, propulsion technique is strongly associated with functionality and training hours and does clearly relate to performance. The current results on technique and performance and their possible causal relationship, but also with impairment and sports discipline, must be further substantiated in a longitudinal study design.The variation in propulsion technique in association with sprint power production among elite wheelchair athletes was examined. Sixty-seven athletes were studied during the World Championships and Games for the Disabled in Assen on propulsion technique and anaerobic work capacity in a 30-s sprint test on a computer controlled wheelchair ergometer.

Method: A total of 3364 participants (910 white men, 909 white women, 678 black men, and 867 black women), initially 20 to 32 years old and normotensive, were included. Cardiovascular reactivity to psychological stressors (video game and star-tracing tasks for 3 minutes, cold pressor test for 1 minute) was measured in 1987-1988. We then examined reactivity as a predictor of significant BP change (≤8 mm Hg, thought to represent a clinically significant increase) over the next 5 years. Logistic regression models were used to control for potential covariates. Significant BP change and the development of hypertension (BP greater than 140/90 or taking medication for hypertension) over the 5-year follow-up were examined in separate analyses. Results: Increased systolic blood pressure (SBP) reactivity to the video game was associated with a significant 5-year SBP increase among the entire cohort, independent of resting SBP (p < .0001). Subsequent analyses showed that this relationship held for men but not for women. Reactivity to the star-tracing task or the cold pressor test did not predict significant BP change. Among black men only, new hypertensives (N = 36) had greater diastolic blood pressure (DBP) reactivity to the video game (p = .01). Conclusions: Although BP reactivity to all physical and mental stressors used in this study did not consistently predict 5-year change in BP in this young cohort, the results indicate that reactivity to a video game stressor predicts 5-year change in BP and early hypertension among young adult men. These findings are consistent with other studies showing the usefulness of stressors producing a primarily β-adrenergic response in predicting BP change and hypertension. The results may be limited by the shortened initial rest and recovery periods used in the CARDIA protocol.",9560868,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031922716

In this paper, we propose a sequential decision-making model of negotiation, called Bazaar. It provides an adaptive, multi-issue negotiation model capable of exhibiting a rich set of negotiation behaviors.

The fax machine, which was the only device that involved connecting with remote parties, became as common as any of the other three mentioned before, and is now essential to modern life. More recently, the Personal Computer (PC) was introduced to home environments, becoming a new common domestic appliance. Whereas in the early times the 'PC to user' symbiosis was associated with the idea of isolation and autonomy, in present times, modems, telematics and the Internet, have broken down that isolation. However, telematics are not only tools for business or serious activities: its ""domestic"" sprouting was stimulated by children and teenagers (computer game and Nintendo generations). Their interest makes their parents be more aware of the practical uses of the 'PC via modem to Net' resources,... and not only for playing games and leisure activities. The Internet enjoys absolute freedom, therefore its contents are not regulated. The content may range from very interesting and useful information (for genuine users), down to contents judged to be intended for immoral, illegal or criminal purposes (users who are foreign to the spirit of the Net). Nevertheless, I personally defend the maintenance of a climate of absolute liberty as far as the Net or telematic networks are concerned. A philosophic principle of complete free communication structures, allows the development of the human mind, eliminating frontiers and integrating mankind. Let us recall that the main paradox of ARPANET, Internet's predecessor, developed for military applications, which transcended fundamental principles of the military environment: hierarchy, rank, power or position. On the Net, users are all equal, from the most humble student with a PC to the most powerful organisation, and this is the principle we must defend. Our efforts should be oriented towards generating useful contents that are permanently updated and improved by means of user-supplier communication. In view of cultural diversity, it is also important to fill the current gaps of information supply in Spanish or other languages different from English. © 1997 The authors.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84887096231

The experimental set-up (ergometer, protocol) proved to be adequate in terms of power output (P30, P5) velocity and heart rate. Male and female athletes were comparable with respect to personal characteristics (age, body weight, training hours). Track athletes (classified in 4 different functional classes) showed a class-related mean power output (P30: mean power produced during the 30-second sprint period) of 23, 68, 100, and 138 W for the male athletes (n = 38) and 38, 77, and 76 W for females in the upper three classes (n = 10). Sprint power was low for the group of subjects with cerebral palsy (35 W; mixed, n = 6) and relatively high for the amputee group (121 W; mixed, n = 6), female basketball players (81 W; n = 5), and two male field athletes (110 W). Significant differences between male and female athletes were found for P30 and P5 (highest mean power output over any of the six 5-second periods). As was to be expected, mean maximum heart rate in the sprint test varied significantly between the track groups from 112 (high lesion group) to 171 beats/minute-1 (low lesion group) but not for both genders. The lower P30 in the T1 and T2 groups must be explained not only by the reduced functional muscle mass and impaired coordination but also by phenomena of cardiovascular dysfunction. Based on the performance parameters, the functional classification of the track athletes into four groups seems adequate. P30 was significantly associated with the personal characteristics of gender and hours of training. A significant correlation was found between P30 and sprint performance times for 200 meters (r = -0.79). No correlation was found between either of the forms of power output and the marathon times. Anaerobic wheelchair work capacity can be adequately studied with the 30-second sprint test that was used in this study. Anaerobic work capacity is highly variable among elite wheelchair athletes with different disabilities and from different sports disciplines and appeared quite strongly influenced by functionality, hours of training, and gender.To study the anaerobic work capacity in wheelchair athletes, 67 elite wheelchair athletes were studied in a 30-second sprint test on a computer-controlled wheelchair ergometer.

Study design: Baseline measurements included 24-hour urinary sodium, potassium, and creatinine levels and food intake (by questionnaire). Resting and stress blood pressures were measured during blood sampling, cold water foot immersion, and a video game before and after 1 week each of supplementation with potassium citrate, 1.5 mmol/kg per day, and placebo administered in random order. Results: Thirty-nine children aged 7 to 15 years were studied. White subjects had higher baseline excretion of potassium than black subjects (p < 0.001) and higher vegetable intake (p < 0.01), which were positively correlated (r = 0.53, p < 0.001).

Cardiovascular reactivity was not attenuated measurably by potassium supplementation compared with placebo. The CVR was greater in children with a family history of hypertension than in those without, but was not greater in black children than in white children. Conclusions: The urinary potassium/creatinine ratio is higher in white than black children because their intake of vegetables is greater; dietary potassium intake may modulate CVR, particularly in white children with a family history of hypertension, but may need to be supplemented for more than 1 week to demonstrate attenuation of CVR; and a family history of hypertension may be a stronger predictor of enhanced CVR than is race.",9255197,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030691786

Computerized tomography revealed a small internal capsule infarct. Diagnostic investigation, including coagulation profiling, sickle screen, antiphospholipid antibody, carotid imaging, and echocardiography did not reveal a cause.

Additionally, during the luteal phase, higher levels of progesterone were associated with higher TPR and lower stroke volume responses to the cold pressor. In contrast, during the follicular phase, higher levels of progesterone were associated with lower vascular resistance responses to the cold pressor. Consistent with data from studies using exogenous estrogens, these results suggest that estradiol may contribute to a lowering of cardiovascular responses to stress.",8817731,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030131089

SIgA secretion rate also increased during the task, although the effect proved significant only toward the end of the task. As such, the data provide preliminary indication that sIgA is sensitive to acute psychological challenge in the laboratory.

Self-monitoring theory suggests that positive self-monitoring (PSM) results in better performance for difficult tasks, whereas negative self-monitoring (NSM) is preferable for easy tasks. When SM was tested under easy and complex task conditions, it was found that performance effectiveness was a function of matching appropriate task difficulty with the SM strategy. Unpaired t-tests compared the first set of 100 trials (pre-task) with the second set of 100 trials (post-task) on a computer skills game requiring hand-eye coordination. The results showed that subjects who changed from the difficult task/PSM condition to the easy task/PSM condition (different task, same SM strategy) performed significantly poorer (P < 0.001) than subjects who changed from the difficult task/PSM condition to the easy task/NSM condition (different task, different SM strategy). A second unpaired t-test comparing the two sets of difference performance scores indicated that performance was significantly superior for subjects using the PSM than the NSM strategy while performing the difficult task (P < 0.05). That is, changing from the easy task/NSM condition to the difficult task/NSM condition produced poorer performance than changing from the easy task/NSM to the difficult task/PSM condition. In terms of subjects' emotions, the use of NSM and PSM when performing easy and difficult tasks, respectively, resulted in markedly less negative affect (P < 0.01), but did not influence positive affect, on pre- and post-task comparisons. Finally, correlations between affect and performance, based on pre- and post-performance and affect scores, were moderate to high.

HSS is connected to the GAME I/O of an Apple microcomputer. The generation of sound is controlled by a program. Xinyinqin is used as a teaching aid of Diagnostics. It has been applied in teaching for three years. In this demonstration we will introduce the following functions of HSS: 1) The main program has two modules. The first one is the heart auscultation training module. HSS can output a heart sound selected by the student. Another program module is used to test the student's learning condition. The computer can randomly simulate a certain heart sound and ask the student to name it. The computer gives the student's answer an assessment: ""correct"" or ""incorrect."" When the answer is incorrect, the computer will output that heart sound again for the student to listen to; this process is repeated until she correctly identifies it. 2) The program is convenient to use and easy to control. By pressing the S key, it is able to output a slow heart rate until the student can clearly identify the rhythm. The heart rate, like the actual rate of a patient, can then be restored by hitting any key. By pressing the SPACE BAR, the heart sound output can be stopped to allow the teacher to explain something to the student. The teacher can resume playing the heart sound again by hitting any key; she can also change the content of the training by hitting RETURN key. In the future, we plan to simulate more heart sounds and incorporate relevant graphs.",8591549,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029436727

Previous research has demonstrated that Black children show greater CV reactivity than White children to psychological stressors, however, the role of heritability in understanding these racial differences is still unknown. Evidence which supports a genetic influence on CV reactivity comes from animal studies, research on family history of EH, and from twin and sibling studies. The present study expands on previous findings by examining racial differences in CV reactivity in 15 pairs of Black siblings, 15 pairs of age-and sex-matched unrelated Black control subjects, 17 pairs of White siblings, and 17 pairs of age-and sex-matched unrelated White control subjects. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and heart rate (HR) measurements were obtained at rest and during a stress task (competitive video game). Black siblings demonstrated a significantly higher intraclass correlation for DBP reactivity than Black controls or White siblings (r=0.73, versus 0.16, 0.14, respectively). Additionally, Black siblings demonstrated a steeper rise and then a plateau in DBP and HR reactivity to the video game task, while White siblings showed a more gradual increase in these measures over the course of playing three video games. The results for DBP and HR reactivity, however, were not consistent among either of the matched control groups.

There is increasing evidence mat the coronary microcirculation of patients with atherosclerosis may be dysfunctional, with the potential of contributing to myocardial ischemia. This study investigated sympathetically mediated coronary microcirculatory and regional noradrenergic effects of mental stress. We measured left anterior descending coronary artery blood flow and norepinephrine kinetics at rest and during a 10-minute video game in 10 CAD patients with nonsignificant atherosclerosis of this artery and in 5 patients with normal coronary angiograms (NCA). The 2 groups did not differ in their responses of systemic and cardiac norepinephrine spillovers, heart rate, and blood pressure during mental stress. Patients with NCA had microvascular dilation during mental stress (26 ± 9% [mean ± SD] decline in coronary vascular resistance from baseline, p < 0.01), whereas patients with CAD did not (9 ± 20% decline, p = 0.11). Six patients with CAD then received intracoronary hentolamine (1.7 ng/kg/min for 5 minutes, followed by 0.17 μg/kg/min) and played the video game again. In contrast to nonsignificant changes in coronary resistance during the initial video game (6 ± 15% decline, p = 0.20), coronary vascular resistance decreased significantly during the repeat video game (25 ± 19% decline, p = 0.02). Vasomotor responses of epicardial coronary artery segments did not differ between the 2 video game studies. Five other patients (4 with CAD, 1 with NCA) repeated the video game during intracoronary administration of 5% dextrose, with systemic and coronary hemodynamic and noradrenergic responses unchanged from those during the initial video game. Thus, the coronary microcirculation of patients with CAD fails to dilate during mental stress, a response likely mediated by α-adrenoceptor activation mat may contribute to myocardial ischemia. © 1995 Excerpta Medica, Inc.

Beat-by-beat finger blood pressure (BP) was measured with a Finapres device. Pulse interval from which heart rate (HR) was derived was obtained from the BP signal. A period of 5 min baseline was used to define resting levels of systolic BP and HR using 20-s averaged values for the calculation of the 95% confidence limit of the two variables. The average test duration was 10 min. During this period a series of video-displayed mazes had to be solved with easy mazes preceding difficult ones. No subject had been exposed to the test before. The maximal BP elevation associated with the test was 27 mmHg. The HR response averaged 11 beats/min. Significant elevations were observed for half the test duration. No significant relationship between these two responses was observed and some subjects exhibited isolated systolic BP or HR responses. When indices obtained during this active mental stress were compared to resting values, positive correlations were observed. When the resting standard deviation (SD) of systolic BP was higher the systolic response was greater. A similar relationship was observed for HR. In addition, when the systolic BP level at rest was higher, the systolic BP reactivity index was greater. However, systolic BP or HR at baseline were not predictive of the systolic BP or HR responses. This study demonstrates the applicability of a new test to assess cardiovascular reactivity.

Careful design of a VR system may encourage the use of “hooks” to allow collection of data, conversion to meaningful informatian, and incorporation of intelligence into later versions and into the final, real-world product. This paper will illustrate these concepts by discussing the challenges of autonomous flight, from simulation to implementation. Fuzzy risk analysis is suggested as a performance evaluation tool for design of CI systems, here defined as systems incorporating artificial neural networks (NN), fuzzy systems, (FZ) evolutionary systems (EC) and/or virtual reality (VR). Intelligent virtual simulation is a tool of the future which promises to move from an intriguing pastime for gamers to a rigorously applied scientific discipline offering economic advantages and service to those working in applications ranging from training simulators to accessibility aids for the handicapped.

Later, the children were presented with a repeated tactile stimulus while engaged in a computer game. Intensity, duration, and latency of the responses were recorded on each trial. It was hypothesized that higher levels of TD would be associated with (a) greater responsiveness and (b) slower habituation rates to the tactile stimulus.

This study examined whether parasympathetic nervous system activity may also underlie familial differences in the heart rate response. Twenty‐four subjects, half of whom were PH+, were exposed to four stressor tasks administered in counterbalanced order. Stressors were chosen based on previous research that suggested vagal contributions to the heart rate response. Stressors were a cold pack to the forehead, isometric hand grip, a noxious film, and a shock‐avoidance video game task. Physiological measures included heart rate (HR), respiration rate (RR), and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). RSA values were corrected for corresponding RR by analysis of covariance. Familial differences in HR were observed in response to the hand grip and video game tasks. However, in both cases analyses suggest that familial differences in reactivity were a function of primarily sympathetic as opposed to parasympathetic influences. Familial differences in RSA were not observed for rest or tasks. This study found no evidence for parasympathetic mediation of familial differences in the heart rate response to the stressors employed. Copyright © 1994, Wiley Blackwell.

Patients had an EEG recorded as well as their response to intermittent photic stimulation (IPS) at flash rates of 1–60 fps. In addition, pattern sensitivity was assessed in all patients by a gratings pattern. Only 2 patients had no previous history of convulsions, and only 2 had a normal basic EEG. All but 1 were sensitive to IPS, and all but 1 were pattern sensitive. Most patients were male, but although this appears to conflict with previously published literature results regarding the sex ratio in photosensitivity, it was due to the male predominance of video game usage. We compared our results with those reported in the literature. Diagnosing video game epilepsy requires performing an EEG with IPS and pattern stimulation. We propose a standard method of testing.

Few studies have examined the determinants of left ventricular mass (LVM) in normotensive children. Eighty-four healthy children, blacks and whites, girls and boys, between 6 and 18 years of age, all with positive family histories of essential hypertension, participated in the study. Demographic and anthropometric characteristics, physical activity, and hemodynamic responses at rest and in response to the stress of forehead cold stimulation and a challenging video game were related to M^mode échocardiographie determined LVM indexed by two indices of body habitus. Hierarchical stepwise multiple regression analysis indicated that the significant independent correlates of LVM per body surface area were gender (boys were greater), baseline systolic blood pressure and heart rate, a physical activity index (sweat episodes per week) and peak systolic blood pressure responses to the forehead cold stressor (final model r2 = 0.49). For LVM/height2 × 7 significant independent corre-lates were adiposity index (weight z score — height z score), gender (boys were greater), age, resting systolic pressure, and systemic vascular resistance reactivity to forehead cold stimulation (final model r2 = 0.42). These findings with normotensive children corroborate other findings that have typically involved hypertensive children, indicating that resting heart rate and systolic pressure, gender, and adiposity are early determinants of LVM indices in children. In addition, the current findings indicate that hemodynamic responses to stress also appear to play a role in the early development of LVM.

The low complexity task system condition was characterized by high ability on the part of the subject coupled with low task demands. The reverse describes the high complexity task system condition. The balanced task complexity system condition matched subjects' ability with demands of the task. In the second trial, the same students either set performance goals or were told to do their best as they played the game. We concluded that balanced task complexity systems elicited active coping with task demands. Goal setting, however, altered the subjects' patterns of autonomic and behavioral responses. Across the goal and task complexity system conditions, performance outcomes were consistent with patterns of autonomic response. When parasympathetic withdrawal was accompanied by sympathetic overbalance, performance was lower. Performance was lower: (a) in the unbalanced task complexity systems when goals were self-set and (b) in the balanced systems when do-your-best goals were applied.

Four studies provide systematic validation and reliability testing for this device and comparisons with other techniques for assessing daily activities. In the first study, the sensitivity of the Actigraph was determined for differentiating physical activities (walking, running, stair climbing, knee bends) versus sedentary activities (reading, typing, playing video games, and performing a mental arithmetic task). Fifteen healthy adults wore the Actigraph on their wrist during activities; oxygen uptake and heart rate were simultaneously recorded. Results revealed that the Actigraph significantly differentiated between the physical activities (p < .0001) and the sedentary activities (p < .0001). Actigraph counts also correlated significantly with oxygen uptake (r= .73) and heart rate (r= .71) during physical activities (r= .46) and sedentary activities (r= .35), respectively. Test‐retest reliability was very high for 12 activities (r= .98). The high level of activity differentiation and strong relationship to oxygen uptake and heart rate suggest the usefulness of this device for behavioral and biomedical studies. However, these studies also indicate that the wrist may not always be the most adequate placement for indexing rate and intensity of daily activities and that further studies are needed to determine the optimal site of monitor attachment.

Sixteen subjects, balanced for gender, were recruited from a random sample of 100 university students. They presented a stratified distribution of responses to the Jenkins Activity Survey (JAS) for Type A behavior assessment. The subjects volunteered in a challenging laboratory session that included the performance of a video game (Video) and the SI for Type A behavior assessment. Generally, Reactivity and Recovery scores for dopamine (D) and adrenaline (A) were positively correlated with such scores for sodium in particular, and were negatively correlated with salivary changes of cortisol (Table 1). The highest levels of significance for univariate F-tests were obtained from Cardiovascular Reactivity and Recovery measures and for dopamine and adrenaline measures when groups were formed by a median criterion to Global Type A assessed by the SI: Hostility plus Time Urgency. Discriminant analyses of Reactivity variables were most successful in classification of Type A and Type B groups when (a) D, A, noradrenaline (NA), HR, and PTT scores were combined as a discriminant model with SI-scores for Global Type A (Table 2), whereas Recovery scores for cardiovascular, or cardiovascular plus catecholamine variables, related to the Global Type A criterion (Table 3).

This phenomenon has not, however, been formally demonstrated for adults under laboratory conditions. In this paper it is reported that similar responses, namely avoidance movements of the head, can be obtained in most human adults provided that they are suitably distracted by playing a computer tracking game. Such behaviours were not obtained when subjects were not so distracted. The use of control conditions also ruled out the possibility that simple movement cues from stimuli presented on a noncollision trajectory are sufficient stimulus to obtain defensive responses. It is of interest to note that latencies for avoidance movements were significantly shorter than those for orienting movements in the same situation, but were no different from the latencies for orienting movements when subjects were not distracted. It is argued that these findings are consistent with the proposition that defensive head movements to looming stimuli, like orienting movements to novel peripheral stimuli, represent a basic visual competence that is normally suppressed (or subsumed) by higher competences.

The greater stability of absolute values was most pronounced with systolic blood pressure. Absolute values were at least as stable as resting values and frequently demonstrated greater stability.

Data from the most recent additional-heart-rate paper by Turner and colleagues were thus reexamined, and additional heart rates during mental arithmetic and a video game were separately calculated for the 24 subjects by first using oxygen consumption and then by using carbon dioxide production.

The Social Competence Interview (SCI) measures physiological changes elicited by re-experiencing a life situation in which a valued striving was unexpectedly hindered. The 14-minute interview yields data on subjects' goals, skills, problem-solving strategies, and social resources. We compared the SCI to video game (VG), mirror drawing (MD), and mental arithmetic (MA) in a racially balanced sample of 260 adolescents (age 14 to 15 years). Blood pressure changes during SCI exceeded those during the other tasks, and were unaffected by race or gender. Blood pressure responses to SCI correlated with responses to MA and MD but appeared to capture a unique domain of social reactivity. Test-retest correlations over 6 months in a random subsample of 27 subjects showed that blood pressure reactivity to SCI and other tasks was reproducible. Intrasubject analyses of responses to the different tasks disclosed subgroups of consistently high and consistently low responders who may be at higher or lower risk. The SCI is not threatening and was rated by subjects as less frustrating or demanding than MD or MA. Its demonstrated effectiveness when administered by several different interviewers suggests the SCI is a promising technique for large scale studies of younger populations.",1882010,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025809332

An IBM-AT compatible microcomputer is being used for the concurrent collection of physiological data and presentation of the laboratory stressors. Digitized cardiovascular data being collected include EKG, Impedance Cardiogram (ICG), phonocardiogram, and a peripheral pulse wave measure. Blood pressure readings are also being collected and stored on disk. The computer presents three challenging video games, each designed to elicit cardiovascular reactions. Processing programs are being used and developed for the standardized scoring of the digitized signals. To assist in epidemiological research a mobile testing unit has been assembled for the easy administration of the test battery in varying geographical locations. The test battery being developed will increase the feasibility of epidemiological and clinical assessment of stress-induced cardiovascular responses which may substantiate a link between reactivity and cardiovascular disease. © 1991.",2050435,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026030340

Twenty‐five unambiguously normotensive young men were tested under the same protocol. For pretask baseline physiological activity, group differences emerged for all cardiovascular and metabolic variables; thus the elevated blood pressure group displayed not only higher resting cardiovascular levels than normotensive subjects, but higher levels of metabolic activity too. With regard to change in physiological activity from rest to task, the group with mildly elevated blood pressure showed reliably larger increases in heart rate to the mental arithmetic task than the normotensive subjects. These effects, however, were not paralleled by group differences in metabolic activity increase. Physiological measures were also taken prior to and during graded dynamic exercise. The subsequent calculation of individual heart rate‐oxygen consumption exercise regression lines allowed the comparison of actual and predicted heart rates during psychological challenge. The subjects with mildly elevated blood pressure displayed significantly greater discrepancies between actual and predicted heart rate values than normotensives during the psychological tasks in general and menta1 arithmetic in particular. Group differences in physiological activity during exercise largely reflected the pattern seen at rest. A possible exception here was systolic blood pressure. Not only were systolic blood pressure levels higher throughout the exercise phase for mildly elevated blood pressure subjects, but this group evidenced more of an increase from rest to exercise than the normotensives.

The basic phase, the so-called 'phase 0', provides information about literature, different strategies of treatment and introduces the use of regular insulin as well as blood sugar self-monitoring. During the 'phase 1' (i.e. 'diabetes education common sense') all the initial information from 'phase 0' will be used practically and discussed in depth. After the patient's actual insulin need (U/24 h) has been estimated, initial algorithms for functional insulin use can be defined. And this is the turning point to 'phase 2' of the group rehabilitation process, the so-called education in functional insulin use. Initial algorithms should be understood as a preliminary answer to the patient's questions, 'What is my basal insulin need?', 'How much insulin do I need for a particular amount of carbohydrates?', and 'What is the hypothetical response of my blood glucose to a particular amount of insulin?'. These algorithms are going to be used and optimised now by the patient (under the supervision of the physician) during the so-called 'insulin games' (fasting or 24 h, experimental violation of traditional dietary rules, etc.) to demonstrate (1) how to influence actual glycaemia through immediate correction of blood sugar off blood sugar target (primary adjustment of insulin dosing), and (2) how to optimise algorithms for insulin use (secondary insulin adjustment) in future conditions of different insulin sensitivity. The 'phase 3' of individual teaching is an ongoing process of updating the patient's knowledge and practical skills. All these phases (0-3) usually require about 40-50 h of (group) teaching. Functional insulin substitution was proposed for 340 type I diabetic patients. The mean glycosilated haemoglobin decreased to the upper limit of normal range in out-patients under the condition of free diet and remains still in this range despite low frequency of acute complications (Diabetologia 30 (1987) 47-48; p < 0.0001 vs. initial values). Computers are used for experimental purposes in all these phases of the rehabilitation process: (1) for the initial (programmed) information ('phase 0'), (2) for estimation of initial algorithms ('phase 1'), (3) as a training computer in the blood sugar simulation process ('phase 2'), and (4) for statistical evaluation of out-patients' clinical data and for up-dating the patient's knowledge ('phase 3'), as an 'artificial diabetes counsellor'.

Since the late 1950s and early 196Os, AI research has received most of its support from the military research establishment [37, 55].1 Not until the 1980s, however, has the military connected this research to specific objectives and products. In 1983, the 600-million Strategic Computing Program (SCP) created three applications for 'pulling' the technology-generation process by creating carefully selected technology interactions with challenging military applications [16]. These applications, an autonomous land vehicle, a pilot's associate, and a battle management system, explicitly connect the three armed services to further AI developments [29, 51, 53]. The Defense Science Board Task Force on the Military Applications of New-Generation Computer Technologies recommended warfare simulation, electronic warfare, ballistic missile defense and logistics management as also promising a high military payoff [18]. In his 1983 Star Wars speech, President Reagan enjoined the scientific community, those who gave us nuclear weapons, to give us the means of rendering these nuclear weapons impotent and obsolete [43]. As in the Manhattan and hydrogen bomb projects, AI researchers and more generally computer scientists are expected to play major parts in this quest for a defensive shield against ballistic missiles. Computing specialists such as John von Neumann played a supportive role by setting up the computations necessary for these engineering feats—with human computers for the atom bomb [10]2 and with ENIAC and other early computers for the hydrogen bomb [9]. The Star Wars project challenges computer scientists to design an intelligent system that finds and destroys targets—basically in real-time and without human intervention. The interdependence of the military and computer science rarely surfaces during our education as computer practitioners, researchers, and teachers. Where might information concerning these important military applications enter into computer science and AI education? Where do students receive information concerning the important role they may play in weapon systems development? One of our students recently remarked that as a computer science major, I did not realize the magnitude of the ramifications of advancing technology for the military. In a field so dominated by the DoD, I will have to think seriously about what I am willing and not willing to do—and what lies in between those two poles.3 As researchers and educators, the authors wish to encourage colleagues and students to reflect upon present and historical interactions between computer science as an academic discipline and profession, and military projects and funding. As computer professionals, we lay claim to specialized knowledge and employ that knowledge in society as developers of computing technologies. Thus, we exercise power. Recognizing that as professionals we wield power, we must also recognize that we have responsibilities to society. To act responsibly does not mean that computer professionals should advocate a complete separation between computer science and military missions. However, we should openly examine the inter-relationships between the military and the discipline and practice of computing. To act responsibly does not mean that computer scientists and practioners should eschew support or employment from the military, although some are justified in taking such a stance.4 To act responsibly requires attention to the social and political context in which one is embedded; it requires reflection upon individual and professional practice; it requires open debate. The lack of attention to issues of responsibility in the typical computer science curriculum strikes us as a grave professional omission. With this article, we hope to add material to the dialogue on appropriate computing applications and their limits. We also hope to provoke reflections on computing fundamentals and practice at the individual, professional, and disciplinary levels, as well as prodding government institutions, professional societies, and industry to support in-depth research on the issues we raise here. Reflection requires information and discussion. Academic computer science departments rarely support serious consideration of even general issues under the rubric of the social and ethical implications of computing. Unlike any other U.S. computer science department, Information and Computer Science (ICS) at UC Irvine has an active research program in the social implications of computing (Computers, Organizations, Policy and Society—CORPS). Even within CORPS, research that addresses the interactions between the military and computer science is difficult to pursue—not because individuals aren't interested, but because they are not able to find professional or academic support. The authors' interests in these issues arose from personal concerns over the dependence of military systems upon complex technology, and the possible grave outcomes of this fragile relationship. CORPS provided a supportive intellectual environment that allowed us to pursue our interests. In 1987, we developed and taught an undergraduate course designed to inform students about military applications and their limits, and allow dialogue on professional responsibilities. In general, little monetary support is available for research that considers these issues, and it is only through support from the Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation and campus instructional funds that we were able to develop and teach the course. Few researchers or educators can devote time and/or energy to pursue the social and ethical implications of their work and profession, in addition to their mainstream research. Since the discipline of computer science does not consider these reflections serious mainstream research, those who chose to pursue these vital questions have difficulties finding employment and/or advancing through the academic ranks. Growing concern over these issues and interest by computer scientists, as evidenced by the group Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility [38], individuals such as David Parnas [39], and this article, may lead to future research support and academic recognition. For now, as concerned professionals, we offer the following reviews. They pose many more questions than answers. This article exemplifies the interdisciplinary investigations which are required as precursors to serious analysis of computing use in these applications. We hope that our reviews generate discussion and debate. In the first section, we present the course rationale and content, as well as student responses. In the sections following the course description, we consider three applications—smart weapons, battle management, and war game simulations—that are generating research and development funds and that have controversial implications for military uses of computing. We start with smart weapons, that is, the development of weapons that can destroy targets with minimal human intervention. Next we look at battle management systems designed to coordinate and assess the use of resources and people in warfare. Finally, we turn to war gaming as a means for evaluating weapon performance and strategies for war fighting. In each case, we describe the state of technology, its current and potential uses and its implications for the conduct of war. © 1989, ACM.

Two studies (total N=24) were conducted in which healthy male undergraduates participated in both one‐hour shock avoidance and separate counterbalanced baseline sessions. In an attempt to maximize subject involvement, a somewhat unconventional, complex shock avoidance procedure was employed. The subject could avoid mild electric shocks depending on video game performance. The primary dependent measures were heart rate, digital blood volume pulse (DBVP), and blood pressure. In both studies, most subjects exhibited immediate and pronounced increases in heart rate in response to the stressor, followed by some habituation. In contrast, DBVP responses did not usually habituate. Similarly, blood pressure was more or less constantly elevated by the stressor. The results of multiple regression analyses indicated that individual differences in mean arterial blood pressure response to the stressor were significantly related to individual differences in heart rate response to the first 15 minutes, but increasingly unrelated to heart rate response, and more related to DBVP response, as the session progressed.

Subjects also completed the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire and the Jenkins Activity Survey. The mild hypertensive subjects displayed higher resting heart rates than the normotensives and larger magnitude heart rate increases to the video game. Although groups did not differ in resting respiratory activity, the metabolic rates tended to be higher in the mild hypertensives and they showed reliably greater increases in oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production during mental challenge. These data were subjected to a variety of interpretations. However, in the absence of psychophysiological assessment during physical exertion, and without direct measurement of cardiao output and arteriovenous oxygen differences, the present results did not permit a choice to be made between rival explanations, and they certainly cannot discount the hypothesis that some borderline hypertensives display excessive cardiac activity and tissue overperfusion during stress. The personality measures did not differentiate groups. However, correlational analyses within each group revealed that whereas systolic blood pressure was positively and significantly related to neuroticism in the mild hypertensive group, for the normotensive subjects the direction of correlation was reversed. In addition, scores on the Jenkins Activity Survey correlated positively with heart rate reactivity to the video game for the mild hypertensives, but not for the normotensives.

Actual heart rate during psychological challenge was substantially greater than predicted heart rate, i.e., there was considerable additional heart rate. This was the case irrespective of whether upper or lower body exercise was used to compute the predictions, and there was no significant difference between the additional heart rates generated from the two exercise tasks, which produced regression lines with similar slope and intercept values.

One hundred thirteen performed a treadmill exercise test, and 51 performed two active coping tasks (playing a video game or mental arithmetic). Blood pressure was monitored at baseline and during the tasks. Significant correlations were observed between the absolute levels of pressure measured during the laboratory tests and ambulatory monitoring, but these were higher for the active coping tasks (r = 0.53 to 0.75) than the exercise testing (r = 0.26 to 0.46) and were no higher for pressures measured during the tasks than at baseline.

These measurements were recorded on both a traditional 3‐channel ECG recorder and the computerized system. Both methods of recording systolic time intervals were independently scored by two different experimenters. In this way, interrater reliability of hand‐scoring, intermethod reliability between hand‐scoring versus computer‐scoring, and interrater reliability of computer‐scoring could be assessed. The interrater reliabilities of hand‐scored systolic time intervals were generally above .90, ranging from .73 for left ventricular ejection time to .99 for R‐R intervals of the ECG, with a mean of .92. The intermethod reliability of the computer versus hand‐scored systolic time intervals also proved to be generally above .90, ranging from .76 for S1‐S2 components of the phonocardiogram to .99 for R‐R, with a mean of .94.

Special attention is drawn to the formal and practical difficulties associated with ""classical"" input/output evaluation paradigms. These problems are especially acute in the case of the vast range of computer-based materials which do not readily fall into the conventional CAL mould. Such software includes adventure games, word processors, spreadsheets etc. We examine the evaluation process in terms of its clientele. We suggest that administrators, working at the strategic level of decision making, and teachers working at the tactical level, have needs for rather different types of information, which cannot necessarily be met through the application of any single approach to evaluation. We identify our particular clientele as being classroom teachers, and we discuss the implications of this targeting for the design of evaluation procedures. We discuss the central role of the practitioners themselves in generating an appropriate richness and variety of information. We describe the development of ""IN-CITES"": a classroom-based case study approach to software evaluation intended for application by autonomous self-programming groups of teachers. This approach is based on the so-called ""triangulation"" methodology, and employs both methodological triangulation (using a range of techniques) and observational triangulation (using a variety of observational perspectives). Our approach is designed to provide teachers with a framework for software evaluation, rather than a rigidly denned set of procedures. We acknowledge that many teachers have specialised knowledge and skills which they will wish to bring to bear on their own problems, and we have worked to provide the outlines of a disciplined approach to the evaluation process analogous to the case history method in routine medical practice. © 1988.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-50849147971

Much recent evidence indicates that both within‐ and between‐individual variations in cardiac parasympathetic heart rate (HR) control can be easily and reliably assessed by measuring the magnitude of respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). Therefore, we used RSA to index cardiac vagal responses to two active coping tasks. Both tasks consisted of the same video game, in one condition with threat of shock for inferior performance, and in the other without such threat. Twenty subjects underwent both tasks (counterbalanced over subjects), plus a preceding resting baseline period. HR and RSA were continuously measured. Results suggested that cardiac parasympathetic activity was diminished from rest to task, contributing to heart rate responses. Exaggerated HR responses were also associated with extreme parasympathetic withdrawal. Furthermore, task condition X sequence of presentation interaction effects showed that threat of shock was particularly effective in elevating HR and reducing RSA when the threat was presented during the first task condition. A repeated‐measures analysis of covariance of HR, attempting to remove the effects of parasympathetic influences upon HR, suggested that sympathetic influences upon HR exceeded any reciprocal vagal effects during the threat condition for those subjects exposed to the threat task first. The findings indicate the importance of considering stress‐related parasympathetic effects upon HR as well as sympathetic‐vagal interactions. Copyright © 1987, Wiley Blackwell.

In the first study, eighth grade girls (mean age = 14.2 yrs) who had participated in a study of the familial aggregation of cardiovascular responses to behavioral stress were asked to repeat the assessment protocol when they were in (he ninth grade (mean age = 15.1 yrs). Results showed that mean task‐induced increases in diastolic blood pressure and heart rate during serial subtraction, mirror image tracing, and isometric handgrip tasks were reliable across test sessions, particularly due to the reliable increases exhibited during the mirror image tracing task. In the second study, fifth grade boys (mean age = 10.4 yrs) who had participated in a previous experiment (Matthews & Jennings, 1984) of cardiovascular responses during a video game were tested in the ninth grade (mean age ‐ 14.0 yrs) in the protocol used in Study 1. Results showed that mean tusk‐induced increases in diastolic blood pressure and heart rate during video games were related to mean task‐induced increases during serial subtraction, mirror image tracing, and isometric handgrip tasks over three years Liter. The association for heart rate increases during the video game and isometric handgrip task was particularly impressive. These results suggest that task‐induced diastolic blood pressure and heart rate responses of children are stable over substantial periods of time and amiss important developmental transitions, and generalize across tasks requiring qualitatively different behavioral responses.

Additionally, they rated their enjoyment of a battery of cartoons and watched excerpts from several television programs. It was found that premenstrual and menstrual women preferred comedy over alternative choices more strongly than did women midway through the cycle. It is suggested that this preference reflects a desire to overcome the hormonally mediated noxious mood states that are characteristically associated with the premenstrual and menstrual phases of the cycle.

Recent evidence suggests, however, that the nuclear arms race may be better approximated by a “Perceptual Dilemma” arising from discrepant perceptions of various outcome utilities. The present experiment compared the effects of two strategies, a matching strategy (called Status Quo) and a matching strategy preceded by unconditional cooperation (called Disarmament Initiatives), within the context of a Prisoner's Dilemma or a Perceptual Dilemma. Results indicated that: (a) the Status Quo strategy sustained competitive behavior, attitudes, and emotions in both the Prisoner's Dilemma and the Perceptual Dilemma; and (b) the Disarmament Initiatives strategy induced significantly more cooperation among subjects locked in a Perceptual Dilemma than those in a Prisoner's Dilemma. The limitations, extensions, and implications of these findings are discussed in terms of political action and future research. © 1987, Sage Publications.

This study compared the cardiovascular increases due to a video game stress task plus 1.0 mg nicotine with those of stress or nicotine alone using an aerosol method of presenting nicotine in measured doses. Twelve young male smokers each participated in four conditions on 4 separate days: stress + nicotine, stress + placebo (stress alone), rest + nicotine (nicotine alone), and rest + placebo. The effects of stress and nicotine were additive for heart rate but less than additive for systolic and diastolic blood pressure. These results indicate that the combined effects of stress and nicotine may be relevant to understanding the prevalence of CHD among smokers.

Psychological stress procedures have received increased usage as an alternative to expensive physical (exercise) stress procedures. In the present investigation, 213 healthy, black or white, male or female children between the ages of 6 and 18 years were exposed to the psychological stress of a video game. The video game challenge was administered by a black or a white experimenter and was played under three levels of increasing stress, 1) personal challenge, 2) experimenter's challenge, and 3) experimenter’s challenge accompanied by a financial incentive, while blood pressure and heart rate were monitored. Results indicated that the video games provoked significant and incremental cardiovascular reactivity across the games. Black children demonstrated significantly greater reactivity than white children; the racial difference was more reliably observed for systolic and diastolic blood pressure than for heart rate. Furthermore, the race of the experimenter exerted a significant effect and often interacted with the race of the child, such that greater reactivity occurred in same-race pairings than in mixed-race pairings.

These differences in emotional reactions, in turn, help account for differential preferences of individual games. The three independent dimensions of pleasure‐displeasure, arousal‐nonarousal, and dominance‐submissiveness were used to assess emotional impacts of individual games. In addition, a preference measure was constructed to evaluate attraction toward, versus avoidance of, specific games. In Study One, a group of subjects provided data on emotional responses to 22 common arcade video games and a different group rated their preferences for the same games. The emotional impact of video games was highly unpleasant, moderately arousing, and moderately dominance‐inducing; thus, the predominant emotional response to these games was aggression, anger, or hostility. I n Study Two, subjects visiting a video game arcade were recruited and assigned to play two games each and to report their reactions to each game immediately after playing the game. Results showed that greater feelings of pleasure, and separately of arousal, while playing video games resulted in higher preferences for the games and that greater dominance (significant only for males) also led to higher preferences. It may be beneficial, therefore, to experiment with more arousing and more dominance‐inducing game designs which are not necessarily unpleasant or which definitely yield high pleasure.

Blood pressure at rest and cardiovascular response to “stress” were studied in 27 girls and 33 boys 11–16 years old. One group (HT, n = 23) had hypertensive mothers with a previous hypertensive pregnancy, another group (NT, n = 20) had normotensive mothers with a previous hypertensive pregnancy and the control group (C, n = 17) had normotensive mothers with normotensive pregnancies. Resting blood pressure was 124/71 mmHg (HT), 117/67 mmHg (NT) and 112/65 mmHg in the 3 groups. Systolic pressure was significantly different in all 3 groups (p < 0.05 ‐ p <0.001). Responses to noise stimulation (100 dBA) were identical in all groups with increases in diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure and cardiac output. During a video game session increases in blood pressure and heart rate were equal in the groups but during physical exercise a slight decrease in diastolic blood pressure was seen in the NT and C groups only. Differences in blood pressure in children with varying maternal history of hypertension do not seem to reflect alterations in the cardiovascular response pattern to “stress”. 1985 Association for the Publication of the Journal of Internal Medicine",3857846,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0021960130

Measurements were also made while subjects undertook graded isotonic exercise. All measures changed as a function of psychological challenge, and during exercise physiological activity increased as an orderly function of workload. For each subject, heart rate was plotted against oxygen consumption over the various exercise loads. For the majority of subjects the analogous data points for the video game and mental arithmetic lay reliably above the exercise heart rate‐oxygen consumption regression lines. When these regression lines were used to predict heart rate values during psychological challenge, the predicted values were significantly less than the values actually recorded for both tasks; although the discrepancy between predicted and actual values was on average greater with mental arithmetic, the difference was not statistically reliable. Pre‐stressor baseline conditions were also associated with heart rate levels greater than predicted, albeit to a lesser extent. Finally, while both stressors produced heart rate adjustments additional to expectancies, inter‐task consistency was low. Copyright © 1985, Wiley Blackwell.

The present study determined the test‐retest reliability of 11 cardiovascular dependent variables during a resting baseline and three common stress tasks: playing a video game, performing a choice reaction‐time test, and performing a cold‐pressor test. Sixty healthy, middle‐aged males underwent testing twice, approximately three months apart. Instructions were delivered via videotape and data were gathered on‐line by computer to ensure a standard laboratory environment. Each task elicited significant increases in blood pressure, vascular rigidity, LVET, heart rate, and stroke volume. In addition, the cold‐pressor test led to increases in total systemic resistance and mean systolic ejection rate. The absolute levels of the 11 dependent variables were correlated across tasks (partial r, baseline removed, = .06 to .69, 32 of 33 comparisons significant at p<.05), indicating that reactivity to stress generalizes across alternate test forms. The absolute levels also showed significant test‐retest reliability (r= .32 to .82; 40 of 44 comparisons significant at p<.05). In addition, for 19 of 33 comparisons, absolute levels showed greater test‐retest reliability than change scores derived by subtracting the initial resting baseline value from the stress‐task value. Finally, blood pressures taken during the stress tests were more highly correlated with the average blood pressures measured via ambulatory monitoring than casual office pressures, suggesting that such stress values may more accurately reflect average blood pressure.

A sample of 12 felonious juvenile residents (aged 15–18) from a highly restricted environment were assigned randomly to a biofeedback or video game group and trained for 10 half‐hour sessions. Results indicated virtually no significant differences between biofeedback and video game training.

Both groups rated themselves equally on self‐control ability, regardless of training. Further comparisons between other institutionalized residents (N = 14) and staff counselors (N = 10) as non‐treatment controls were made.

Clinical examination, a laboratory rest session and period of blood pressure self-monitoring were followed by a laboratory stress session. The latter involved performance of two tasks demanding active behavioral coping (the Stroop interference task and video game) and one passive condition (a distressing movie). Mild hypertensives showed significantly greater pressor reactions (both in absolute and percentage terms) than normotensives to tasks requiring active behavioral coping, but not to the passive condition. The transient hypertension group produced heightened reactions in diastolic but not systolic pressure. Greater heart rate and pulse transit time reactions were also observed in the transient group, suggesting that exaggerated cardiac responsiveness to active challenges may be characteristic of the prehypertensive profile.

Experiment 1 also addressed the matter of inter-task consistency; in addition to the video game, subjects were presented with an unsignalled reaction time task and led to believe that relatively quick reactions attracted financial reward, while slower ones brought either a burst of loud noise or withdrawal of money previously earned. Forty-two male subjects were tested on both tasks on two occasions, a week apart. Of the two tasks, the video game elicited the greater reactivity. In addition, individual variations in reactivity showed striking temporal stability for both tasks. However, inter-task consistency was much less marked; in fact, a significant inter-task correlation was obtained only on the first occasion of testing. It is probable that limited consistency here was in some measure due to the ineffectiveness of our reaction time task in eliciting substantial reactivity. Finally, reactivity was independent of baseline heart rate level. In experiment 2, three extreme high and three extreme low cardiac reactors were selected from an initial sample of 23 male subjects, on the basis of reactivity during an initial session with the video game, and subsequently studied during four further sessions. Once more, impressive stability of heart rate reactivity was apparent over sessions. In experiment 3, we examined the reliability of individual variations in cardiac reactivity in women and the issue of whether temporal stability is constrained by menstrual cycle effects. Twenty-four females were tested on the video game both preovulatory and postovulatory, with half being tested first during the preovulatory phase and half being tested first during the postovulatory phase. Again, the most striking finding was the marked stability of individual variations in cardiac reactivity over both time and menstrual cycle phase. © 1984.",6518222,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0021606232

Following an initial test game, 51 smokers were randomly assigned to a 2 (smoke vs. sham smoke) x 2 (stress vs. no stress) design. The results showed that the subjects who sham smoked (inhaled unlit cigarettes) under no stress evidenced minimal changes in cardiovascular parameters. Subjects who smoked under no stress evidenced approximately 12 mmHg increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and 9 mmHg increases in diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and a 15 beat-per-minute increase in heart rate (HR). These effects were similar in magnitude to those seen in subjects who sham smoked under stress. By contrast, subjects who smoked under stress showed markedly larger increases in all cardiovascular parameters, approximately doubling the magnitude of the observed response over that seen with either smoking or stress alone.

Relative to baseline, subjects showed much larger increases in heart rate during “space invaders” than during the control condition. However, oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, respiratory rate and volume also increased more. While the absolute magnitude of metabolic differences between conditions could be regarded as modest relative to heart rate differences, given the effective range of variations possible for each parameter, the existence of highly significant differences in oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production militates against assertions of overall cardiac‐metabolic independence during “space invaders.” Nevertheless, analysis of individual differences in heart rate reactivity would seem to provide some evidence of metabolically‐unjustified heart rate changes during “space invaders.” High heart rate reactors during “space invaders” did not differ from low reactors in either oxygen consumption or carbon dioxide production. In addition, this relatively high heart rate reactivity was specific to the “space invaders” condition; high and low heart rate reactors displayed no differences in heart rate, or in any other physiological measure, during the control condition or during baseline.

During selective attention the subjects were told that the tone pips were irrelevant to the primary task, the video games. The N100 component of the auditory evoked potential was used as an index of attention paid to the tone pips, while performance on the video games was considered to be a reflection of attentiveness to the primary task. There were no group differences in N100 amplitude or latency during passive attention, supporting the results from several previous studies. During selective attention Group H gave small N100 responses to the tone pips during each video game trial, including the first one, while Group L gave large N100 responses to the tone pips during the first trial, and small responses during later trials. Both groups performed equally well during the first few trials, but while the performance of Group L continued to improve, that of Group H deteriorated over the last few trials. The results were interpreted in terms of limited capacity models of attention, and provided some support for the hypothesis that psychopaths allocate a relatively large proportion of their attentional resources to things of immediate interest, effectively ignoring other stimuli.

Many studies have been undertaken in both Europe and elsewhere. These have, in general, been published in the academic journals and a number of conferences have been held to discuss the techniques proposed. Almost without exception, the proposals which have been considered rely on behaviourally orientated methodologies akin to the many techniques currently in use in the USA (and in other countries where teaching assessment is common practice). It has been the author’s contention that such techniques are an inappropriate way of improving teaching effectiveness as they demand a pre-specification of criteria deemed to be appropriate, the teacher is then assessed against this ‘ideal profile’. It is the author’s view that the teacher should be perceived as a professional, capable of undertaking his task with autonomy. This is particularly valuable if a mechanism exists to assist him in identifying his strengths and weaknesses so that he can capitalise on the former whilst endeavouring to eradicate the latter (through the application of appropriate staff development). Thus, in 1975, as part of a doctoral research project, the author devised a teaching appraisal system which became know as TARGET. TARGET is an acronym for Teaching Appraisal by Repertory Grid Elicitation Techniques and is based on the principles of Personal Construct Psychology. The primary objective when using the TARGET system is to raise the perceptual awareness of the teacher to his strengths and weaknesses, this, in turn, may enable him to become more effective at this job. However, the system remains far less threatening than those aforementioned behavioural techniques. Since 1975, the author has continued his research and whilst TARGET has been, and is still, used in a number of institutions of further and higher education in the UK, USA, Australia and even India, the methodology developed has been refined and improved over the intervening period. Consequently, the technique now proposed by the author as the most efficient way of raising perceptual awareness (and thus achieving the same goals as the TARGET system), is to encourage individual lecturers to sit in front of a small microprocessor and interact with a programme, (designed using the same principles of Personal Construct Psychology), such that feedback can be given immediately in terms of his strengths and weaknesses. This paper briefly considers the TARGET system as it was devised, the interactive computer programme as it is currently used at Garnett College, (and some other institutions in Europe and Australia) and finally, illustrates the principles underlying both the TARGET and interactive computer programme by describing the game of MISUNDERSTOOD, which can be played without the hardwear support, of the video or computing kind, necessary in both the former methods. MISUNDERSTOOD can be played in groups of three or four (with a number of groups playing simultaneously) as a one-off staff development exercise. It has already been successfully used by an international motor company, a number of educational institutions and the Prison Education Officers Training Scheme. The author contends therefore, that raising perceptual awareness by any of the three methods described in this paper makes a positive and worthwhile contribution to the improvement of the effectiveness of the FE teacher, and supports this with evidence drawn from his experience of applying the techniques in a number of institutions in which he has been employed and had some responsibility for Staff Development. © 1981, The Vocational Aspect of Education Ltd.",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84953949064

At rest and during pratice of the game, before and after intravenous administration of labetalol, .75 mg/kg b.w., the following variables were measured: heart rate, mean aortic blood pressure, cardiac output, splanchinic-hepatic blood flow and the arterial concentration of catecholamines. The game provoked an increase in heart rate of 30%, in aortic mean pressure of 23%, in cardiac output of 38% and in splanchnic-hepatic vascular resistance of 21%. During the game the arterial noradrenaline concentration was 0.756 ng/ml compared to 0.22 ng/ml at rest. The adrenaline concentration was 0.06 ng/ml at rest and not changed during the game. The alpha- and beta-receptor blockade reduced the response of all the circulatory variables measured, with exception of the increase in splanchnic-hepatic vascular resistance. The arterial noradrenaline concentration was higher at rest (0.36 ng/ml) and during the game (0.86 ng/ml). It is concluded that a game of this type, which the subjects find entertaining, causes a satisfactory circulatory response to be used for the study of the hemodynamic effects of emotional stress. In contrast to the acute effect of a beta-receptor blocker the combined alpha- and beta-receptor blocker, labetalol, causes a fall in mean arterial blood pressure and an increase in cardiac output at rest.

The hypothesis was that EEG alpha power, which is presumably inversely proportional to cortical activation, is functionally lateralized according to task demands: e.g., a decrease in alpha power in the right hemisphere during 'non-verbal' performance. The hypothesis was tested by engaging subjects in several processing tasks utilizing different modes and degrees of information processing. Bilateral EEG's were recorded from central, temporal, and partial scalp locations from 7 male and 7 female Ss. All Ss were right handed as determined by questionnaire and family history. Ss were given training trials on the day preceding testing to minimize unfamiliarity, and stabilize learning performance. All tasks were conducted with eyes open. Spectrum power in the alpha band was higher in the right hemisphere when Ss listened to a verbal passage and reversed when they performed in an imaginative block rotation task. The most task dependent asymmetry occurred over the angular gyrus. Compared to intergame baselines, mean square power was suppressed in the right hemisphere when Ss either watched or played PONG (Video Tennis). The fact that watching PONG was nearly as effective in producing alpha asymmetry as playing the game implied that the asymmetry was due mostly to perceptual rather than motor factors. Within task variables were examined to more closely determine the functional relationship between overt performance on the visuomotor task and EEG alpha asymmetry. The number of PONG hits per rally was an inverted 'U' function of right hemisphere arousal: i.e., the number of PONG hits was greatest for a moderate asymmetry rather than for the greatest level of right hemisphere activation. These results support previous findings concerning task induction of EEG asymmetry, but in addition indicate that fluctuations of EEG asymmetry within a task relate systematically to variations in overt performance.",,"English",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0017658629

It is a two-mode system, operating with standard NTSC signals or with nonstandard signals from cable systems, video games, and the like. Mode recognition is automatic, but forced-mode operation is possible in isolated field cases where necessary. When receiving standard signals, the circuit includes a fixed modulus divider for deriving the vertical sync pulses from the phase-locked horizontal oscillator, an out-of-phase detection circuit, and digital integration to delay rephasing for several fields. In the nonstandard mode, the system functions much as a conventional vertical oscillator, with field-by-field synchronization, automatic retrace initiation in the absence of a sync pulse, and noise immunity for a time following retrace. The I2L technology permits linear circuits to be included on the chip. Among these are a monostable multivibrator, a voltage regulator, and a circuit which processes the integrated composite sync to provide more reliable phasing information. Another processing circuit converts the vertical drive pulse to a ramp suitable for driving the vertical power amplifier. Extensive field testing indicates that the system performs as well as conventional systems for any degraded signal and is substantially better for most.

A fairly complex decision-making internation simulation game was employed in a computer-controlled laboratory. The results indicate that deterrent threats are somewhat more likely to result in compliance than are compellent threats. Further, there were no gross differences between male and female response patterns. It was found, however, that males are somewhat more likely to comply to a threat. But, of the noncompliers males are more likely to behave aggressively and attack the other. Evidence is presented that indicates that females respond to an emotion-evoking hostile situation by passively resisting or withdrawing. © 1972, The Psychonomic Society, Inc..

A second study was then conducted in which a digital computer served the function of providing objective feedback to the M.D. during diagnosis, indicating the number and names of diseases consistent with each acquisition of new information about the patient. Performance of the subjects under the latter condition indicated significant behavioral changes when compared with the previous study. Findings are interpreted in terms of the man–machine relationship and its importance to in-line computer applications of a diagnostic nature. © 1964, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.

Records were taken of the age, sex, and occupations of persons normally resident in the administrative county of Cheshire who died between these ages from June, 1956, to December, 1959, and an inquiry was carried out over a period of 17 months into the medical history and environmental particulars of 536 persons who had died aged 45 to 64 years from coronary thrombosis, and the results were compared with similar information from 642 controls of the same sex and age-erouos taken at random. The answers received indicate that approximately three-fifths of those who had died had been receiving medical treatment, though not necessarily for a cardiac condition for longer than six months. There was no evidence to establish that family circumstances, holidays, consumption of fat, alcohol, or tea, times of meals or of rising or going to bed, participation in sport or games, visits to club or hotel, employment (in the case of women), addiction to radio or television, overtime or night working, and whether the job was manual or not, heavy or light, affect the likelihood of death from coronary thrombosis. Only a very small percentage (2%) of men controls who had not received medical treatment in the past three years travelled more than 6 miles (9.6 km.) in each direction between home and work. The death rate among farmers and agricultural workers was much lower in middle age than that of any other socio-economic group, whether from general causes or from coronary thrombosis. Work involving walking, and gardening in leisure, lessened liability to death from coronary thrombosis. The death rate was highest among sedentary workers, particularly clerks. To hold a position of responsibility at work does not carry an increased risk. There was a higher death rate from coronary disease among smokers, but no evidence to suggest an association between death from coronary disease and pipe smoking. Evidence suggested that overweight among manual workers is associated with increased liability to death from coronary thrombosis. There were significantly fewer deaths among coffee drinkers. A number of observations, based on subjective evidence and therefore subject to suspicion, raise the possibility that psychological and temperamental factors, particularly worry, may increase liability to death from coronary disease. Heredity, so far as could be deduced from such an inqniry asthis is an influence. The answers to the questions show that there is no need for a person to restrict himself or herself from those ordinary pleasures of life discussed in this paper in order to avoid death from coronary thrombosis. © 1962, British Medical Journal Publishing Group.
