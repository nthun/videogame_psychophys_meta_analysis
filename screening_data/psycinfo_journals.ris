AB  - [Correction Notice: An erratum for this article was reported in Vol 100(9) of Acta Paediatrica (see record [rid]2011-18375-027[/rid]). In the original article, the software extracted heart rate variability (HRV) frequency bands incorrectly. The corrections are given in the erratum.] Objective: To investigate how playing a violent/nonviolent television game during the evening affects sympathetic and parasympathetic reactions during and after playing as well as sleep quality during the night after playing. Subjects and Methods: In total, 19 boys, 12–15 years of age, played television games on two occasions in their homes and participated once without gaming. Heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV) and physical activity were measured during gaming/participating and the night to follow using a portable combined heart rate and movement sensor. A sleep diary and questionnaires about gaming experiences and session-specific experiences were filled in. Criteria for Selection of Games: Violent game involves/rewards direct physical violence (no handguns) against another person, and nonviolent game involves/rewards no violence; same game design (‘third-person game’); conducted in the same manner; no differences concerning motor activity; similar sound and light effects; no sexual content, violence against women or racial overtones. Results: During violent (vs. nonviolent) gaming, there was significantly higher activity of the very low frequency component of the HRV and total power. During the night after playing, very low frequency, low frequency and high frequency components were significantly higher during the violent (vs. nonviolent) condition, just as total power. There were no significant differences between the three conditions (violent/nonviolent/no gaming) with respect to an index reflecting subjectively perceived sleep difficulties. Nor was there any difference between violent and nonviolent condition for any single sleep item. Conclusion: Violent gaming induces different autonomic responses in boys compared to nonviolent gaming—during playing and during the following night—suggesting different emotional responses. Subjectively perceived sleep quality is not influenced after a single gaming experience. Future studies should address the development of the autonomic balance after gaming over longer time than a night, physiological adaptation to frequent gaming and potential gender differences.

AB  - In high-risk domains such as human space flight, cognitive performances can be negatively affected by emotional responses to events and conditions in their working environment (e.g., isolation and health incidents). The COgnitive Performance and Error (COPE) model distinguishes effects of work content on cognitive task load and emotional state, and their effect on the professional's performance. This paper examines the relationships between these variables for a simulated Mars-mission. Six volunteers (well-educated and -motivated men) were isolated for 520 days in a simulated spacecraft in which they had to execute a (virtual) mission to Mars. As part of this mission, every other week, several computer tasks were performed. These tasks consisted of a negotiation game, a chat-based learning activity and an entertainment game. Before and after these tasks, and after post-task questionnaires, the participants rated their emotional state consisting of arousal, valence and dominance, and their cognitive task load consisting of level of information processing, time occupied and task-set switches. Results revealed significant differences between cognitive task load and emotional state levels when work content varied. Significant regression models were also found that could explain variation in task performance. These findings contribute to the validation of the COPE model and suggest that differences in appraisals for tasks may bring about different emotional states and task performances.

AB  - There exists at present an opening for the U.S. to consider seriously the ratification of the Convention of the Rights of the Child. It will take quite determined effort to educate the public about the meanings and implications of the Convention—a public for whom street children are not everyday realities but come to them as reassuring well-groomed innocents who grow up to win millions on a television game show (as in the film Slumdog Millionaire). It is a public that is in denial of child trafficking within it own borders. It is one that sees almost all such ‘problems’ in racial and class terms; even with many genuinely concerned and sympathetic individuals, such strife is interpreted as happening to 'other people's' children. Into this cultural ambivalence, where children are seen as personal concerns, pounce political opportunists like Rush Limbaugh who can at once favor prosecuting minors as adults and appear concerned with the plight of young Somalis, suddenly attuned to the context of their lives that may have directed their actions. At the same time, merely rushing to ratify and implement the Convention because it is the ‘right thing to do’ without due consideration of the multiple ramifications throughout the U.S. legal system could very well exacerbate the plight of many, even as it provides help for others. The process, were it to come to the center of the legal–political stage as it very well might, will no doubt be steeped in, and have to contend with, the messy, ongoing cultural politics of American childhoods.

AB  - Objective: To develop a computer game addiction inventory (CGAI) for Chinese college students. Methods: A primary inventory made by the authors was applied to 477 college students from 8 universities in Beijing for exploratory factor analysis, and then to 405 college students for confirmatory factor analysis. Results: After exploratory factor analysis, a questionnaire consisting of 33 items was established, which had four factors: dependence and addict behavior, emotion arousal, functional impairment, and shame and dissatisfaction. These four factors could explain 55.1% of the total variance, were confirmed by confirmatory factor analysis. The internal consistency of the questionnaire was good. Criteria validity shown by higher scores in addiction group than normal control was also satisfying. Conclusion: The CGAI has good psychometric features and could be applied to college students.

AB  - This research examined the effects of casino design and congruence in trait and state emotion on at-risk gambling intentions and psychological restoration. Video simulations representing two casino designs (playground vs. gaming) were presented to 484 participants (241 males) varying in gambling sub-type. The playground design features a recognizable theme, elements of nature, and spaciousness; the gaming design focuses on the gambling machines in a maze-like setting with low ceilings. For low trait arousal participants, at-risk intentions were higher when environmental arousal (EA) was high (mismatch) than when low (match). For high trait arousal participants, at-risk intentions were higher when EA was high (match) than when low (mismatch). A similar pattern of results occurred for restoration but only for pleasure trait-state congruency in non-problem gamblers. For problem gamblers, the effects of trait-state congruence on restoration were restricted to those with low trait pleasure for the playground design. The effects of congruence in trait and state emotion are bounded by the positivity of the outcome (at-risk gambling intention vs. restoration), the design of the casino (playground vs. gaming), the dimension of emotion (arousal vs. pleasure), the pole of the emotion (low vs. high), and gambler subtype (problem vs. non-problem).

AB  - Video-game users represent 40% of the French population and adolescents are the primary users. Yet excessive playing of video games has become a problem in modern society and is manifesting itself in treatment centers for adolescents. Before attempting to gain insight into this problematic use, we must understand video gaming itself and its implications for the gamer. The aim of this research is to propose an understanding of video-game playing based on some dimensions of emotional functioning such as emotion regulation, emotion intensity, emotion expression, and alexithymia. A total of 159 adolescents took part in the study. Regular gamers regulated their emotions more than irregular gamers did. They also felt their emotions more intensely. But regular gamers expressed their emotions less than irregular gamers did. Finally, the regular gamers' alexithymia level was higher than the irregular gamers' level. Especially, they had more difficulty being emotionally reactive. The avatar's evolution in the virtual environment may help mediate adolescents' problematic emotional experiences to give them meaning and enable their appropriation. As such, video games may act as a medium for projecting and experiencing one's emotional life by staging the emotional self, thereby explaining the engagement of adolescents in video gaming.

AB  - Several studies have shown that exposure to media violence can lead to strong emotional reactions. This may be particularly true for video game violence and anger. Yet, few studies have explored the relationship between video game play and more complex emotions, such as guilt and shame. Further, prior research has not explored how exposure to the narratively rich violence found in role-playing video games may cause feelings of guilt. The research experiment presented here (n = 184) aims to fill this gap in the literature by explaining how the immoral actions of a video game character impact the player’s feelings of guilt. Specifically, results show that playing as a video game character that has committed immoral actions caused players to feel guilty and ashamed, especially if they felt transported or 'wrapped-up' in the narrative. Exposure to immoral actions also caused players to show increases in aggressive behavioral tendencies. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This experiment investigated the relationship between motivation, engagement, and learning in a video game task. Previous studies have shown increased autonomy during practice leads to superior retention of motor skills, but it is not clear why this benefit occurs. Some studies suggest this benefit arises from increased motivation during practice; others suggest the benefit arises from better information processing. Sixty novice participants were randomly assigned to a self-controlled group, who chose the progression of difficulty during practice, or to a yoked group, who experienced the same difficulty progression but did not have choice. At the end of practice, participants completed surveys measuring intrinsic motivation and engagement. One week later, participants returned for a series of retention tests at three different difficulty levels. RM-ANCOVA (controlling for pre-test) showed that the self-controlled group had improved retention compared to the yoked group, on average, β = 46.78, 95% CI = [2.68, 90.87], p = 0.04, but this difference was only statistically significant on the moderate difficulty post-test (p = 0.004). The self-controlled group also showed greater intrinsic motivation during practice, t(58) = 2.61, p = 0.01. However, there was no evidence that individual differences in engagement (p = 0.20) or motivation (p = 0.87) were associated with learning, which was the relationship this experiment was powered to detect. These data are inconsistent with strictly motivational accounts of how autonomy benefits learning, instead suggesting the benefits of autonomy may be mediated through other mechanisms. For instance, within the information processing framework, the learning benefits may emerge from learners appropriately adjusting difficulty to maintain an appropriate level of challenge (i.e., maintaining the relationship between task demands and cognitive resources).

AB  - In most violent video games, players are put in stressful situations where enemies are trying to kill them. This is reflected by the results of previous research showing that violent video games increase physiological arousal (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure, galvanic skin response). In this study, I investigate the effect of playing violent video games on emotional stress detected by a new methodology: voice analysis. Because changes and disturbances in vocal responses can be understood as reactions to emotional stress, I expected that violent video games would increase voice stress. Participants (N = 87 French university students; 40% female; Mage = 21.2) played either a violent or nonviolent game for 20 min. After game play, participants read a stress-provoking story aloud while their voices were recorded. Voice recordings were analyzed to determine the amount of emotional stress in participants’ voices using Automated Voice Stress Analysis. As hypothesized, voice stress was higher among violent video game players than among nonviolent video game players. Voice stress was also higher for men than for women. No interaction between video game content and the gender of participants was observed. This study confirms that violent video games have physiological consequences on players, as predicted by the General Aggression Model and also introduces a promising nonobtrusive physiological measure in media psychology research.

AB  - MEAP, the moving ensemble analysis pipeline, is a new open‐source tool designed to perform multisubject preprocessing and analysis of cardiovascular data, including electrocardiogram (ECG), impedance cardiogram (ICG), and continuous blood pressure (BP). In addition to traditional ensemble averaging, MEAP implements a moving ensemble averaging method that allows for the continuous estimation of indices related to cardiovascular state, including cardiac output, preejection period, heart rate variability, and total peripheral resistance, among others. Here, we define the moving ensemble technique mathematically, highlighting its differences from fixed‐window ensemble averaging. We describe MEAP's interface and features for signal processing, artifact correction, and cardiovascular‐based fMRI analysis. We demonstrate the accuracy of MEAP's novel B point detection algorithm on a large collection of hand‐labeled ICG waveforms. As a proof of concept, two subjects completed a series of four physical and cognitive tasks (cold pressor, Valsalva maneuver, video game, random dot kinetogram) on 3 separate days while ECG, ICG, and BP were recorded. Critically, the moving ensemble method reliably captures the rapid cyclical cardiovascular changes related to the baroreflex during the Valsalva maneuver and the classic cold pressor response. Cardiovascular measures were seen to vary considerably within repetitions of the same cognitive task for each individual, suggesting that a carefully designed paradigm could be used to capture fast‐acting event‐related changes in cardiovascular state.

AB  - Background: Sedentary or near-sedentary activities are associated with overweight/obesity in epidemiological studies. This has traditionally been attributed to physical activity displacement. A little-explored area is whether behavioural stresses alter sensations of appetite and eating behaviour. We examined whether behaviours conducted seated (television viewing, video gaming) induce different eating patterns, associated with differential levels of stress response. Methods and findings: We conducted a randomized controlled trial in 72 overweight/obese adult males, assigned to three groups (24 per group): (i) non-violent television (control group); (ii) non-violent game (FIFA); (iii) violent game (Call of Duty). Following a standardized breakfast, the 1-h intervention was followed by 25-min rest, with sweet and savoury snacks and drinks available ad libitum. Stress markers (heart rate, blood pressure, visual analogue scale (VAS)) were measured throughout. Heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and stress by VAS were significantly higher (p < 0.05) playing video games than watching non-violent television, though the two game groups did not differ. Considered separately, only the violent video game group consumed more energy (Δ = 208.3 kcal, 95%CI 16, 400), sweet foods (Δ = 25.9 g, 95%CI 9.9, 41.9) and saturated fat (Δ = 4.36 g, 95%CI 0.76, 7.96) than controls. Conclusion: Playing video games in overweight/obese adult males is associated with an acute stress response relative to watching non-violent television, associated with greater subsequent food intake. These findings highlight the need to focus on the metabolic effects, as well as the energy costs, of activities involving sitting in relation to obesity risk.

AB  - An experiment investigated the effects of violent content in video games on two physiological indicators of the fight-or-flight response (cortisol and cardiovascular changes) and on accessibility of aggressive thoughts in children. Participants played a randomly assigned violent or nonviolent video game, rated the game on several dimensions, and did a word completion task. Results showed that the violent video game increased cortisol and (for boys) cardiovascular arousal (relative to baseline) more than did the equally exciting nonviolent game. The violent game also increased the accessibility of aggressive thoughts. The cortisol findings in particular suggest that playing a violent video game may activate the sympathetic nervous system and elicit a fight-or-flight type response in children. Theoretical implications and future research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Stereotypical sexist representations of men and women in popular culture reinforce rigid views of masculinity (e.g., males as being strong, in control, masterful, and aggressive) and femininity (e.g., women as being fragile and weak, unassertive, peaceful, irrational, and driven by emotions). The present study examined associations between the fictional series Fifty Shades—one popular culture mechanism that includes pervasive traditional gender role representations—and underlying sexist beliefs among a sample of 715 women ages 18–24 years. Analyses revealed associations between Fifty Shades readership and sexism, as measured through the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory. Namely women who reported reading Fifty Shades had higher levels of ambivalent, benevolent, and hostile sexism. Further, those who interpreted Fifty Shades as 'romantic' had higher levels of ambivalent and benevolent sexism. Our findings support prior empirical studies noting associations between interacting with aspects of popular culture, such as television and video games, and individual beliefs and behaviors.

AB  - This study assessed the effect of experimentally manipulated emotional arousal on swearing fluency. We hypothesised that swear word generation would be increased with raised emotional arousal. The emotional arousal of 60 participants was manipulated by having them play a first-person shooter video game or, as a control, a golf video game, in a randomised order. A behavioural measure of swearing fluency based on the Controlled Oral Word Association Test was employed. Successful experimental manipulation was indicated by raised State Hostility Questionnaire scores after playing the shooter game. Swearing fluency was significantly greater after playing the shooter game compared with the golf game. Validity of the swearing fluency task was demonstrated via positive correlations with self-reported swearing fluency and daily swearing frequency. In certain instances swearing may represent a form of emotional expression. This finding will inform debates around the acceptability of using taboo language.

AB  - A task force of experts was convened by the American Psychological Association (APA) to update the knowledge and policy about the impact of violent video game use on potential adverse outcomes. This APA Task Force on Media Violence examined the existing literature, including the meta-analyses in the field, since the last APA report on media violence in 2005. Because the most recent meta-analyses were published in 2010 and reflected work through 2009, the task force conducted a search of the published studies from 2009–2013. These recently published articles were scored and assessed by a systematic evidentiary review, followed by a meta-analysis of the high utility studies, as documented in the evidentiary review. Consistent with the literature that we reviewed, we found that violent video game exposure was associated with: an increased composite aggression score; increased aggressive behavior; increased aggressive cognitions; increased aggressive affect, increased desensitization, and decreased empathy; and increased physiological arousal. The size of the effects was similar to that in prior meta-analyses, suggesting a stable result. Our task force concluded that violent video game use is a risk factor for adverse outcomes, but found insufficient studies to examine any potential link between violent video game use and delinquency or criminal behavior. Our technical report is the basis of this article. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Recent developments in the area of media entertainment research have introduced and tested the model of entertainment as the satisfaction of three intrinsic needs in the context of video game play and Facebook use. This study extended this line of self-determination theory (SDT) through the examination of specific mechanisms that link social Question and Answering site usage to the satisfaction of the intrinsic needs for competence, autonomy, and relatedness. Results revealed that although writing activities were associated with all three need satisfactions, reading activities were associated with the satisfaction of autonomy and competency, and sharing/archiving activities were only associated with the need for competency. Furthermore, only the autonomy need was found to be related to enjoyment. Results were discussed in terms of the theoretical contributions to online media entertainment research. Practical implications for the industry were addressed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)
AB  - Public Policy Relevance Statement—The current study is among the first to investigate the entertainment reception of using social Q&A websites. Results highlight the role of the need satisfaction of autonomy as crucially important in perceiving enjoyment and suggest that not all modes of social Q&A use contribute to users’ hedonic entertainment experience in the same manner.

AB  - Objective: To assess the effects of a personal robot, providing diabetes self-management education in a clinical setting on the pleasure, engagement and motivation to play a diabetes quiz of children (7–12) with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), and on their acquisition of knowledge about their illness. Methods: Children with T1DM (N = 27) participated in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in which they played a diabetes mellitus self-management education (DMSE) game, namely a diabetes quiz, with a personal or neutral robot on three occasions at the clinic, or were allocated to a control group (care as usual). Personalised robot behaviour was based on the self-determination theory (SDT), focusing on the children's needs for competence, relatedness and autonomy. The SDT determinants pleasure, motivation and diabetes knowledge were measured. Child-robot interaction was observed, including level of engagement. Results: Results showed an increase in diabetes knowledge in children allocated to the robot groups and not in those allocated to the control group (P = .001). After three sessions, children working with the personal robot scored higher for determinants of SDT than children with the neutral robot (P = .02). They also found the robot to be more pleasurable (P = .04), they answered more quiz questions correctly (P = .02), and were more motivated to play a fourth time (P = .03). The analysis of audio/video recordings showed that in regard to engagement, children with the personal robot were more attentive to the robot, more social, and more positive (P < .05). Conclusion: The study showed how a personal robot that plays DMSE games and applies STD based strategies (i.e., provides constructive feedback, acknowledges feelings and moods, encourages competition and builds a rapport) can help to improve health literacy in children in an pleasurable, engaging and motivating way. Using a robot in health care could contribute to self-management in children with a chronic disease and help them to cope with their illness.

AB  - Advances in realistic graphics and artificial intelligence are hallmarks of evolved video games, as environments and characters are made to seem more real. Little is known, however, about whether or not character model changes may impact players’ relationships with familiar avatars, especially since anthropomorphism—the perception of nonhuman objects as being human or humanlike—is understood as central to player–avatar interaction (PAX). This study leveraged a naturally occurring change to massively multiplayer online game avatars to conduct a field quasiexperiment to investigate whether enhanced avatar anthropomorphism influences PAX dimensions: emotional investment, anthropomorphic autonomy, suspension of disbelief, and sense of control. Longitudinal analysis showed that enhanced anthropomorphism had no significant impact on any PAX dimension immediately or over time, when controlling for demographic and gameplay variables. Player comments suggest the change was experienced not as a change in humanness, but as a shift in perceptual realism—believability, lifelikeness, depth—that impacted the experience of the avatar-mediated gameworld more broadly.

AB  - Seamless cooperation between individuals is essentially a crucial aspect of any successful endeavor. A host of literature has been published in the academic realm about how cooperation could be cultivated. However, true cooperation often forms organically without external enforcement. Recently, there has been one special example of a context where cooperation seemed to have effortlessly sprung up between people who might not even have had previous connections. The context is video/online games; games such as Ingress, Pokémon Go, and World of Warcraft bind people together to work against insurmountable odds and to overcome jointly held challenges. Organizations of many types have recently begun to gamify their structures and services in order to cultivate such seamless cooperation. However, before this potential of games can be successfully wielded outside video games, we need to understand better how games are able to cultivate such cooperation. Therefore, in this study we investigate how games can induce and cultivate we-intention of working as a group. Specifically, we investigate how cooperative game features affect different forms of group dynamics and how they further translate into we-intentions. We employ data from users of the augmented reality game Ingress (N = 206). The results show that cooperative game features induce we-intentions via positively increasing group norms, social identity, joint commitment, attitudes toward cooperation, and anticipated positive emotions. The findings imply that practitioners who are looking to increase cooperation should find that gamification inspired by cooperative game design is beneficial and preferable over individual-based gamification efforts.

AB  - Though playing with natural versus traditional game controllers affects game experiences, studies have not investigated how power poses affect the experience of playing natural controlled video games. Participants keeping powerful poses experienced increased enjoyment, presence, and controller responsiveness compared with those holding powerless poses. Congruent with self-perception and automatic activation models, mediation analyses uncovered direct effects of power poses and also indirect effects in which power poses increased power feelings, which in turn were associated with higher enjoyment, presence, and controller responsiveness but reduced arousal. This provides initial evidence for how physical poses affect people's experiences with natural game interfaces, and highlight basic self-perception and automatic activation mechanisms behind the effect.

AB  - Wireless sensor networks are utilized in medical area to gather multimedia information from multiple sources, such as video streams, images, voice, heartbeat and blood pressure data, which call for higher bandwidth and more available spectrum. Whereas, today's radio spectrum is very crowded for rapid increasing popularities of various wireless applications. Hence, wireless sensor networks utilizing the advantages of cognitive radio technology, namely cognitive wireless sensor network (CWSN), is a promising solution for spectrum scarcity problem. A major challenge in CWSN is maximizing its network lifetime by appropriate power control mechanism. To solve the distributed power control issues in CWSN with imperfect information, a game-theoretic power control mechanism based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is proposed according to the difference and independence of channel sensing results among users of cognitive wireless sensor network (UCWSNs). UCWSNs can use HMM to infer whether its competitors take part in the game, which improves the information accuracy of game and leads to an optimal transmission power. Moreover, to meet the QoS (Quality of Service) of UCWSNs for multimedia information, a utility function based on the tradeoff of signal to interference plus noise ratio and power efficiency is defined for the power control game. Simulation results indicate that the game-theoretic power control mechanism based on HMM can not only improve the power efficiency, but also meet the target SINR better compared with other methods.

AB  - Previous research has shown that individuals with substance use disorder equally value small and large magnitude rewards. This has led some researchers to conceptualize the problematic behaviors associated with this disorder as being, at least in part, caused by a deficiency in processing reward stimuli. Considering the documented similarities between substance use disorder and disordered gambling, the current study sought to investigate whether problem gamblers also display such an aberrant pattern of incentive processing. Skin conductance responses (SCRs) to small and large magnitude wins were recorded from 16 problem gamblers (PGs) and 16 healthy controls (HCs) while they completed a computer-simulated electronic gaming machine task. The results show that, while large wins elicited greater SCRs compared to small wins for the HC group, no difference in SCR amplitude was found following large and small wins in the PG group. These findings suggest that problem gamblers may be less effective at evaluating the value of incentives, and are discussed in terms of relevant theoretical frameworks.

AB  - Purpose: To determine the effect of pre-meal screen-time activities on subjective emotions, subjective appetite, and food intake (FI) in 9–14 year-old girls. Methods: In this clinical study, 31 girls completed four 45-min treatment conditions of television viewing (TVV), video game playing (VGP), a challenging computer task (CT), and sitting without screen exposure (control) in a randomized order. Each treatment condition was followed immediately by an ad libitum pizza lunch, and FI was calculated from the weight of the consumed pizza. Subjective appetite was assessed at baseline, 15, 30, and 45 min during the treatment condition, and upon trial completion at 75 min. Subjective emotions were assessed at baseline and at 45 min. Results: FI was not affected by screen type, but was positively correlated with body composition (fat mass [FM, kg], fat free mass [FFM, kg]) in all treatment conditions. Subjective appetite was not affected by screen type, but increased with time in all treatment conditions (p < 0.0001). Subjective emotions were affected by VGP only. Anger, excitement, frustration, and upset feelings were increased at 45 min following VGP. VGP led to increased frustration compared to control (p = 0.0003), CT (p = 0.007) and TVV (p = 0.0002). Conclusion: Exposure to TVV or CT before eating did not affect subjective emotions, subjective appetite, or FI, and no difference was found between screen activities and the control condition for average appetite or FI. Despite a change in subjective emotions during the VGP condition, there was no increase in subjective appetite or subsequent FI. These findings suggest that physiologic signals of satiation and satiety are not overridden by environmental stimuli of pre-meal screen-time exposure among young girls.

AB  - Violent video game playing has been associated with both positive and negative effects on cognition. We examined whether playing two or more hours of violent video games a day, compared to not playing video games, was associated with a different pattern of recognition of five facial emotions, while controlling for general perceptual and cognitive differences that might also occur. Undergraduate students were categorized as violent video game players (n = 83) or non‐gamers (n = 69) and completed a facial recognition task, consisting of an emotion recognition condition and a control condition of gender recognition. Additionally, participants completed questionnaires assessing their video game and media consumption, aggression, and mood. Violent video game players recognized fearful faces both more accurately and quickly and disgusted faces less accurately than non‐gamers. Desensitization to violence, constant exposure to fear and anxiety during game playing, and the habituation to unpleasant stimuli, are possible mechanisms that could explain these results. Future research should evaluate the effects of violent video game playing on emotion processing and social cognition more broadly. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Although digital assistants with humanlike features have become prevalent in computer games, few marketing studies have demonstrated the psychological mechanisms underlying consumers’ reactions to digital assistants and their subsequent influence on consumers’ game enjoyment. To fill this gap, the current study examined the effect of anthropomorphic representations of computerized helpers in computer games on game enjoyment. In the current research, consumers enjoyed a computer game less when they received assistance from a computerized helper imbued with humanlike features than from a helper construed as a mindless entity. We offer a novel mechanism that the presence of an anthropomorphized helper can undermine individuals’ perceived autonomy during a computer game. Across six experiments, we show that the presence of an anthropomorphized helper reduced game enjoyment across three different games. By measuring participants’ perceived autonomy (study 1) and employing moderators such as importance of autonomy (studies 2, 3, and 4), we also provide evidence that the reduced feeling of autonomy serves as the mechanism underlying the backfiring effect. Finally, we demonstrate that the effect of anthropomorphism on game enjoyment can be extended to other game-related outcomes, such as individuals’ motivation to persist in the game (studies 4 and 5).

AB  - Facial expressions are critical in forming social bonds and in signalling one's emotional state to others. In eating disorder patients, impairments in facial emotion recognition have been associated with eating psychopathology severity. Little research however has been carried out on how bulimic spectrum disorder (BSD) patients spontaneously express emotions. Our aim was to investigate emotion expression in BSD patients and to explore the influence of personality traits. Our study comprised 28 BSD women and 15 healthy controls. Facial expressions were recorded while participants played a serious video game. Expressions of anger and joy were used as outcome measures. Overall, BSD participants displayed less facial expressiveness than controls. Among BSD women, expressions of joy were positively associated with reward dependence, novelty seeking and self‐directedness, whereas expressions of anger were associated with lower self‐directedness. Our findings suggest that specific personality traits are associated with altered emotion facial expression in patients with BSD. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background and aims: Internet addiction (IA) was recently defined as a disorder tagging both the impulse control and the reward systems. Specifically, inhibitory deficits and reward bias were considered highly relevant in IA. This research aims to examine the electrophysiological correlates and autonomic activity [skin conductance response (SCR) and heart rate] in two groups of young subjects (N = 25), with high or low IA profile [tested by the Internet Addiction Test (IAT)], with specific reference to gambling behavior. Methods: Oscillatory brain activity (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma) and autonomic and behavioral measures [response times (RTs) and error rates (ERs)] were acquired during the performance of a Go/NoGo task in response to high-rewarding (online gambling videos and video games) or neutral stimuli. Results: A better performance (reduced ERs and reduced RTs) was revealed for high IAT in the case of NoGo trials representing rewarding cues (inhibitory control condition), probably due to a 'gain effect' induced by the rewarding condition. In addition, we also observed for NoGo trials related to gambling and video games stimuli that (a) increased low-frequency band (delta and theta) and SCR and (b) a specific lateralization effect (more left-side activity) delta and theta in high IAT. Discussion: Both inhibitory control deficits and reward bias effect were considered to explain IA. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This article describes conversation-based assessments with computer agents that interact with humans through chat, talking heads, or embodied animated avatars. Some of these agents perform actions, interact with multimedia, hold conversations with humans in natural language, and adaptively respond to a person’s actions, verbal contributions, and emotions. Data are logged throughout the interactions in order to assess the individual’s mastery of subject matters, skills, and proficiencies on both cognitive and noncognitive characteristics. There are different agent-based designs that focus on learning and assessment. Dialogues occur between one agent and one human, as in the case of intelligent tutoring systems. Three-party conversations, called trialogues, involve two agents interacting with a human. The two agents can take on different roles (such as tutors and peers), model actions and social interactions, stage arguments, solicit help from the human, and collaboratively solve problems. Examples of assessment with these agent-based environments are presented in the context of intelligent tutoring, educational games, and interventions to help struggling adult readers. Most of these involve assessment at varying grain sizes to guide the intelligent interaction, but conversation-based assessment with agents is also currently being used in high stakes assessments.

AB  - Patients with a psychotic disorder show lower cardiorespiratory fitness and higher mortality rates compared to healthy individuals. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to explore whether in patients with first-episode psychosis a low cardiorespiratory fitness is associated with decreased physical activity and increased sedentary levels. Twenty-nine outpatients (21 men; 22.8 ± 5.1 years) performed a maximal exercise test to assess their maximum oxygen uptake (VO₂max), wore a Senswear armband for five consecutive days and were assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Twenty-four patients (82.8%) scored below the normative cardiorespiratory values. The percent-predicted VO₂max ranged from 47% to 109%. In a backward regression analysis, less time spent sedentary (min/day) was the only independent predictor of a higher VO2max. The model explained 28.0% of the variance in the VO2max-score. The current study indicates that future research should explore whether reducing sedentary behaviour (e.g. time spent napping or prolonged sitting during waking hours) might improve cardio-respiratory fitness levels. Interventions targeting recreational screen time (watching television, computer use, playing video games, etc.) or replacing passive to more active video games should be investigated.

AB  - During the last decade, the literature concerning Video Game Addiction (VGA) has grown strongly. Several studies deal with motivational aspects of VGA. However, there is a lack of qualitative studies allowing us to describe various emotions, cognitions and behaviors related to video game playing in this type of research. The purpose of the present research is to operationalize emotions, cognitions and behaviors proposed in a previous study with a protocol that permits to address VGA in a panel of various video game players. For this purpose, the Assessment of Cognitions, Emotions, and Behaviors Involved in Gaming (ACEBIG) was created. The findings were discussed in the context of a CBT intervention for VGA. Excessive Gamers (EG) presented more negative emotions and negative physical manifestations. The excitement and expectations about excitement were higher in EG group. EG presented more expectations about self-worth. When losing, self-devaluation and coping strategies dealing with negative emotions was highlighted. This research emphasizes the importance of cognitive avoidance of reality and immersion into the game. EG reported more expectations about social relationships through the game and more challenge related to other players. Interesting findings concerned behaviors (e.g., preparatory behaviors for improving gaming experience). The results of this research provide evidences that VGA is close to addictive behaviors and lead to some clinical implications. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Playful competition is an important hallmark of healthy child development. Playful competition facilitates moral learning, rewards perspective-taking skills, and challenges children to healthily regulate unpleasant emotions such as frustration, anger, and jealousy. Despite this, research on the effects of competitive video gaming has focused on antisocial outcomes, such as declines in prosocial behavior. Moreover, methodological shortcomings such as experimental studies using designs with poor generalizability, and a lack of longitudinal studies, leave open the influence of competitive gaming on social development among preadolescent children. This longitudinal study therefore investigated the relation between competitive gaming and changes in children’s social development across 3 measures: conduct problems, peer relations, and prosocial behavior. At 2 timepoints, 1 year apart, 184 Dutch children (8.31–12.68 years old) reported their gaming frequency and listed their favorite games to play, and their parents reported their children’s psychosocial health. Children’s nominations were coded as including or not including a competitive video game. Children who nominated a competitive game at the first time point were more likely to show a decrease in conduct problems and an improvement in peer relations. No interactions were observed between competitive gaming and gaming frequency. These results encourage future research to investigate the social benefits of playful competitive gaming among peers, and for future studies to take other variables such as violent content, cooperative play, and real world competitive play into account.

AB  - Focusing mainly on the company Nintendo, this paper examines the political economic and cultural forces underpinning the video game industry’s recent interest in merging entertainment and health promotion. This is a trend best exemplified in sexagenarian actress Helen Mirren’s endorsement of Nintendo’s fitness-themed game Wii Fit Plus. In one sense, ‘health-entertainment’ is deemed a product of the coercive laws of competition that impress the need for reinvestment and innovation as a way of warding off industry rivals. Nintendo’s turn to health promotion is from this perspective an extension of the ‘console wars’ that in the past drove gaming companies to pursue verisimilitude on screen in hopes of attracting (young male) consumers. In another sense, the present moment offers an ideal time to direct innovation towards the issues of health and healthy ageing in particular, as the cultural logics of healthism and the ‘third age’ both emphasise the virtues of ‘healthy’ and autonomous consumer activity. As such, Nintendo has pursued aesthetic simplicity but kinaesthetic realism as a way of extending the appeal of video gaming beyond the male youth demographic. In examining the implications of these developments, it is argued that health and entertainment, as independent constructs, are conceptually reimagined through their integration with one another. The pursuit of entertainment is made ‘responsible’, thereby remedying the concern that video gaming is an unhealthy activity. The pursuit of health, meanwhile, becomes a matter of playful, technology-enhanced and ultimately consumption-based experience. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - When aiming to improve another person’s long-term well-being, people may choose to induce a negative emotion in that person in the short term. We labeled this form of agent-target interpersonal emotion regulation altruistic affect worsening and hypothesized that it may happen when three conditions are met: (a) The agent experiences empathic concern for the target of the affect-worsening process, (b) the negative emotion to be induced helps the target achieve a goal (e.g., anger for confrontation or fear for avoidance), and (c) there is no benefit for the agent. This hypothesis was tested by manipulating perspective-taking instructions and the goal to be achieved while participants (N = 140) played a computer-based video game. Participants following other-oriented perspective-taking instructions, compared with those following objective perspective-taking instructions, decided to induce more anger in a supposed fellow participant who was working to achieve a confrontation goal and to induce more fear in a supposed fellow participant who was working to achieve an avoidance goal.

AB  - Adolescence is a time of increased emotionality and major changes in emotion regulation often elicited in autonomy-relevant situations. Both genetic as well as social factors may lead to inter-individual differences in emotional processes in adolescence. We investigated whether both 5-HTTLPR and attachment security influence adolescents’ observed emotionality, emotional dysregulation, and their aggressive hostile autonomy while interacting with their mothers. Eighty-eight adolescents at age 12 were observed in interaction with their mothers during a standardized, emotion eliciting computer game task. They were genotyped for the 5-HTTLPR, a repeat polymorphism in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene. Concurrent attachment quality was assessed by the Late Childhood Attachment Interview (LCAI). Results revealed a significant gene × attachment effect showing that ss/sl carriers of 5-HTTLPR show increased emotional dysregulation and aggressive hostile autonomy towards their mothers. The results of the study suggest that secure attachment in adolescence moderates the genetically based higher tendency for emotional dysregulation and aggressive reactions to restrictions of autonomy during emotional social interactions with their mothers.

AB  - Evidence surrounding the attraction to media violence is mixed and the effects of violent video game play on players varies across experimental participants. Differences in both may be explained by differences in experienced positive or negative arousal. This study utilizes the limited capacity model of motivated mediated message processing (LC4MP) and the motivation activation measure (MAM), which measures resting activation of the appetitive and aversive arousal systems, to explore the relationship between attraction to media violence, arousal, and aggression. In part 1, a questionnaire found that men and frequent players of violent games expected to enjoy violent games more than nonviolent games. In addition, participants whose scores on the MAM characterized them as risk takers (high scores on appetitive arousal and low scores on aversive arousal) indicated a stronger preference for violent games compared to the other three arousal types, which is in line with the LC4MP. In the experimental portion of the research, after playing a violent game, those participants characterized as risk avoidant (high on aversive arousal and low on appetitive arousal) were significantly less aggressive than all other arousal groups. Overall, results show that individual differences in the appetitive and aversive arousal systems can explain attraction to violent media. Furthermore, arousal resulting from violent video game play can be experienced as pleasant or aversive, and it is this experience of arousal that explains variations in aggressive responses to violent video games.

AB  - We studied the emotional processes that allow people to balance two competing desires: benefitting from dishonesty and keeping a positive self-image. We recorded physiological arousal (skin conductance and heart rate) during a computer card game in which participants could cheat and fail to report a certain card when presented on the screen to avoid losing their money. We found that higher skin conductance corresponded to lower cheating rates. Importantly, emotional intelligence regulated this effect; participants with high emotional intelligence were less affected by their physiological reactions than those with low emotional intelligence. As a result, they were more likely to profit from dishonesty. However, no interaction emerged between heart rate and emotional intelligence. We suggest that the ability to manage and control emotions can allow people to overcome the tension between doing right or wrong and license them to bend the rules.

AB  - This paper argues that most video game enjoyment can be understood in terms of the type of feedback used, the rules set out by the game and the social elements of the game—concepts that have been identified as critical to video games. Self-determination theory (DT) is used as a lens for understanding the mechanism by which these traits might lead to enjoyment. Specifically, the argument is that feedback, rules, and social elements of games will fulfill the dimensions of SDT—competence autonomy, and relatedness. Then, the dimensions of SDT will predict enjoyment. Participants were presented with a game that emphasized feedback, rules, or social elements. Games that emphasized flexible rules led to feelings of competence while games that emphasized social elements led to feelings of relatedness. Competence and elatedness then led to feelings of enjoyment. In doing so, this study identifies key elements of video games while illuminating ways to understand video game enjoyment.

AB  - A large meta-analysis by Anderson et al. (2010) found that violent video games increased aggressive thoughts, angry feelings, physiological arousal, and aggressive behavior and decreased empathic feelings and helping behavior. Hilgard, Engelhardt, and Rouder (2017) reanalyzed the data of Anderson et al. (2010) using newer publication bias methods (i.e., precision-effect test, precision-effect estimate with standard error, p-uniform, p-curve). Based on their reanalysis, Hilgard, Engelhardt, and Rouder concluded that experimental studies examining the effect of violent video games on aggressive affect and aggressive behavior may be contaminated by publication bias, and these effects are very small when corrected for publication bias. However, the newer methods Hilgard, Engelhardt, and Rouder used may not be the most appropriate. Because publication bias is a potential a problem in any scientific domain, we used a comprehensive sensitivity analysis battery to examine the influence of publication bias and outliers on the experimental effects reported by Anderson et al. We used best meta-analytic practices and the triangulation approach to locate the likely position of the true mean effect size estimates. Using this methodological approach, we found that the combined adverse effects of outliers and publication bias was less severe than what Hilgard, Engelhardt, and Rouder found for publication bias alone. Moreover, the obtained mean effects using recommended methods and practices were not very small in size. The results of the methods used by Hilgard, Engelhardt, and Rouder tended to not converge well with the results of the methods we used, indicating potentially poor performance. We therefore conclude that violent video game effects should remain a societal concern. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Assessing presence using questionnaires can yield interesting insights into the user experience in virtual environments, but is also limited both in terms of reliability and validity. Breaks in presence (BIPs) are an interesting alternative, given that the researcher can assess them correctly. Prior studies on the psychophysiology of BIPs followed an exploratory approach by not providing a cognitive mechanism for BIPs and lacking in external validity. We argue that BIPs can be considered a special form of orienting responses involving both the real and the virtual world. In the first of the presented studies, we investigated which types of BIPs can be differentiated and to what degree they affect the user experience. In the second study, we modified a commercial video game by introducing the previously identified BIPs and recorded psychophysiological measurements. The results are in line with findings on orienting responses and should provide fertile ground for future research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - We conducted an experiment to examine individuals’ perceptions of enjoyable and meaningful video games and the game characteristics and dimensions of need satisfaction associated with enjoyment and appreciation. Participants (N = 512) were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups that asked them to recall a game that they found either particularly fun or particularly meaningful, and to then rate their perceptions of the game that they recalled. Enjoyment was high for both groups, though appreciation was higher in the meaningful- than fun-game condition. Further, enjoyment was most strongly associated with gameplay characteristics and satisfaction of needs related to competency and autonomy, whereas appreciation was most strongly associated with story characteristics and satisfaction of needs related to insight and relatedness.

AB  - The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of the type of interface device in the efficacy of a serious game that teaches emotional regulation (ER) strategies in a non-clinical sample of adolescents. We conducted a between-participants experiment in which participants (N = 61) played a frustration induction game, and then an ER game (a breathing strategy game), using one of three types of devices (computer, smartphone, and RGB-D camera). Frustration mood and perceived arousal were the main variables measured. Results revealed a significant interaction between moment (pre-induction phase, post-induction phase, and regulation phase) and the type of interface device used in the frustration mood scores. In participants who used the computer and smartphone, frustration increased after the induction phase and decreased after the regulation phase. However, for participants who used the RGB-D camera, frustration decreased significantly after the induction phase, and this change was maintained after the regulation phase. Changes in arousal were similar with the three devices. This study highlights that the type of interface device (and specifically, the participation of the body) is a crucial variable in the efficacy of serious games affecting users’ emotional experience.

AB  - Background: Adolescents spend many hours in sitting activities as television viewing, video game playing and computer use. The relationship between sedentary behavior and respiratory health remains poorly elucidated. To date there have been no studies evaluating the relationship between sedentary behavior and pulmonary function in young populations. The purpose of this study is to examine the association between the trajectory of screen-based sedentary behavior from 11 to 18 years and pulmonary function at 18 years in a Brazilian birth cohort. Methods: Data from a longitudinal prospective study conducted among the participants of the 1993 Pelotas (Brazil) Birth Cohort. Time spent on television, video games, and computers during a weekday was self-reported at ages 11, 15 and 18 years. For each age, sedentary behavior was defined as the sum of time spent on these screen-based activities. To evaluate the sedentary behavior trajectory during adolescence group-based trajectory modeling was used. Outcome variables were three pulmonary function parameters: forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and peak expiratory flow (PEF), evaluated by spirometry, at 18 years expressed as z-scores. Crude and adjusted linear regressions, stratified by sex, were performed. Results: The three-group trajectory of sedentary behavior was the best fitting model. The trajectory groups were: always high (representing 38.8% of the individuals), always moderate (54.1%), and always low (7.1%). In the adjusted analyses, boys in the always-low group for sedentary behavior had higher FVC at 18 years (β = 0.177; 95% CI:0.027;0.327; p = 0.021) than boys in the always-high group. There were no differences for other pulmonary function parameters in boys. No significant association was found for girls. Conclusion: The trajectory of screen-based sedentary behavior throughout adolescence was not consistent associated with pulmonary function at 18 years.

AB  - Objectives: The authors propose to explore a psychic phenomenon, the 'auto-empathy', as implemented in the context of digital spaces and particularly in the situation of the player who embodies an avatar (a pixel figure) in a video game. Method: From the perspective of a theoretical opening both phenomenological and psychoanalytic, auto-empathy is the process in which, taking the position of the 'other-in-oneself', we represent our subjective world—or the all states of our subjectivity (actions, emotions, thoughts)—by an empathic relationship with ourselves. The auto-empathy relationship is a process of distancing, and symbolic appropriation, in which we are divided into halves, implementing our innate ability to be both subject and object for ourselves. Results: The mediatization of auto-empathy in digital worlds can put ourselves instead of a figure that represents us—our avatar—so that our empathy is turned towards ourselves indirectly. This second time of empathy for a virtual figure of the self, called 'mediatized auto-empathy' or 'virtual auto-empathy', would contribute thirdly to the development of empathy for oneself. Finally, the development of empathy for others would be supported in a fourth time, by the attention the players are paying to each other in network games. Discussion: These four hypotheses, illustrated by clinical cases, open an interrogation concerning the frame of the psychoanalytical work. In the adolescent, the work of virtualisation, which consists in the creative anticipation of its subjective possibilities, seems regularly impeded. The mental duplicity is no longer in a position to operate a symbolizing distance between the real self and the virtual self, between the subjective self and the subjectivising self. The other-in-oneself is ineffective in proposing to the adolescent an empathic dialogue with oneself. Consequently, the autorepresentation flirts with the seizure, in particular in the subjective states of breaks. Nevertheless, the digital spaces could be indirect media of appropriation of subjective experiences for the teenager. Conclusion: Our reflections led us to think of auto-empathy as the realization of the other-in-oneself which allows us to represent our own subjective world. The auto-empathy mediatized by an avatar can thus be described as a representation by empathy of our subjective part that contains this character. From then on, the space of the video game appears as a space of subjectivation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - A common problem in the older population is the risk of falling and related injury, immobility, and reduced survival. Age-related neuronal changes, e.g., decline in gray-and white-matter, affect neuronal, cognitive, and motor functioning. The improvement of these factors might decrease fall events in elderly. Studies showed that administration of video game-based physical exercise, a so-called exergame, or omega-3 fatty acid (FA) may improve motor and/or cognitive functioning through neuronal changes in the brain of older adults. The aim of this study is to assess the effects of a combination of exergame training with omega-3 FA supplementation on the elderly brain. We hypothesize that an intervention using a combination approach differently affects on the neuronal structure and function of the elderly’s brain as compared to the sole administration of exergame training. The study is a parallel, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial lasting 26 weeks. Sixty autonomous living, non-smoking, and right-handed healthy older (> 65 years) adults who live independently or in a senior residency are included, randomized, and allocated to one of two study groups. The experimental group receives a daily amount of 13.5 ml fish oil (including 2.9 g of omega-3 FA), whereas the control group receives a daily amount of 13.5 ml olive oil for 26 weeks. After 16 weeks, both groups start with an exergame training program three times per week. Measurements are performed on three time-points by treatment blinded investigators: pre-intervention measurements, blood sample after 16 week, and post-intervention measurements. The main outcomes are motor evoked potentials of the right M. tibialis anterior (transcranial magnetic stimulation) and response-related potentials (electroencephalography) during a cognitive test. For secondary outcomes, reaction time during cognitive tests and spatio-temporal parameters during gait performance are measured. Statistics will include effect sizes and a 2 × 2-ANOVA with normally distributed data or the non-parametric equivalent for data not fulfilling normal distribution. The randomized controlled study is the first to investigate the effectiveness of exergame training combined with omega-3 FA in counteracting age- and behavioral-dependent neuronal changes in the brain.

AB  - Emotions shape behavior, but there is some debate over the manner in which they do so. The authors propose that how emotions shape behavior depends, in part, on how people expect emotions to shape behavior. In Study 1, angry (vs. calm) participants made more money in a negotiation when they expected anger to be beneficial. In Study 2, angry (vs. calm) participants killed more enemies in a computer game when they expected anger (but not calmness) to promote performance. In Study 3, excited (vs. calm) participants were more creative when they expected excitement to promote performance, whereas calm (vs. excited) participants were more creative when they expected calmness to promote performance. These findings demonstrate that, at least sometimes, what emotions do depends on what we expect them to do. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Many contemporary computer games, notably action and role‐playing games, represent an interesting class of navigation‐intensive dynamic real‐time simulations inhabited by autonomous intelligent virtual agents (IVAs). Although higher level reasoning of IVAs in these domains seems suited for action planning, planning is not widely adopted in existing games and similar applications. Moreover, statistically rigorous study measuring performance of planners in decision making in a game‐like domain is missing. Here, five classical planners were connected to the virtual environment of Unreal Development Kit along with a planner for delete‐free domains (only positive preconditions and positive effects). Performance of IVAs employing those planners and IVAs with reactive architecture was measured on a class of game‐inspired test environments of various sizes and under different levels of external interference. The analysis has shown that planning agents outperform reactive agents if (i) the size of the problem is small or if (b) the environment changes are either hostile to the agent or infrequent. In delete‐free domains, specialized approaches are inferior to classical planners because the lower expressivity of delete‐free domains results in lower plan quality. These results can help to determine when planning is advantageous in games and for IVAs control in other dynamic real‐time environments. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - A number of studies have shown that prosocial behavior is associated with enhanced well-being, but most prior experimental studies have involved actual or potential face-to-face contact with the beneficiary. To establish that it is prosocial behavior itself, and not only an increased sense of social relatedness to the recipient that improves well-being, participants (n = 76) were invited to play a simple computer game, where half were made aware of a chance to have an anonymous prosocial impact through gameplay. As compared to the control condition, this group experienced more positive affect, meaningfulness and marginally more vitality. Going beyond self-reported outcomes, they also demonstrated better post-game performance on a subsequent Stroop task, providing behavioral evidence for the positive effects of prosocial behavior. Also supported was the hypothesis that these positive effects of prosocial behavior on well-being were mediated by subjectively assessed autonomy and competence need satisfactions.

AB  - Fear research faces a dilemma as typical methods of induction elicit passive or indirect fear, rather than authentic or direct fear. The present study investigated and compared the effects of interactivity, or agency, on the physiological responses of participants as measures of direct fear as they either played or watched a horror-the med video game. Assuming agency allows for greater immersion, the former group would exhibit greater physiological responses, possibly indicating greater fear reaction. Change scores were calculated from subtracting baseline mean values from exposure mean values for every participant in measures of electrodermal activity (EDA), respiratory rate (RR), and heart rate (HR). Self-reported fear data was also gathered for every participant. Players had a significantly greater increase than watchers in EDA, RR, and HR change scores. Players and watchers did not differ significantly in self-reported fear. Change score t tests for specific events that occur in the video game are also reported. These results suggest that the variable of agency may have had the effect of inducing a greater fear response and that it provides utility for researchers seeking to ethically induce direct fear.

AB  - This article explores emotional expression and awareness in the context of a virtual environment specific to young adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and how emotional awareness and expression can support postsecondary outcomes. A qualitative study was conducted with five young adults with ASD who actively played a massively multiplayer online role playing game (MMORPG) in a virtual environment. All participants were enrolled in a large urban university where interviews were conducted in the campus library. One of the most significant findings was related to the emotional awareness and expression of the participants. Advancements in virtual environments hold the potential to support social skills, friendship development, and emotional awareness and expression that will ultimately increase successful transitions through the development of support networks such as friendships and work-related relationships.

AB  - In carefully selected groups of video game playing (VGP) experts and nonexperts, we examined valence‐concordant emotional expressivity. We measured electromyographic (EMG) activity over the corrugator supercilii muscle while participants viewed pleasant, neutral, and unpleasant pictures. Potential group differences concerning valence‐concordant expressivity may arise from differences concerning the participants' emotional reactivity. To control for such differences, we concomitantly measured skin conductance response (SCR) and, in a separate affect misattribution procedure (AMP), valence transfer from the same set of stimuli. Importantly, we found attenuated valence‐concordant EMG activity over the corrugator supercilii muscle in VGP experts compared to nonexperts, but no differences were evident concerning SCR or valence transfer in the AMP. The findings suggest that expertise in VGP is particularly associated with reduced valence‐concordant emotional expressivity. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The effects of video games on children’s psychosocial development remain the focus of debate. At two timepoints, 1 year apart, 194 children (7.27–11.43 years old; male = 98) reported their gaming frequency, and their tendencies to play violent video games, and to game (a) cooperatively and (b) competitively; likewise, parents reported their children’s psychosocial health. Gaming at time one was associated with increases in emotion problems. Violent gaming was not associated with psychosocial changes. Cooperative gaming was not associated with changes in prosocial behavior. Finally, competitive gaming was associated with decreases in prosocial behavior, but only among children who played video games with high frequency. Thus, gaming frequency was related to increases in internalizing but not externalizing, attention, or peer problems, violent gaming was not associated with increases in externalizing problems, and for children playing approximately 8 h or more per week, frequent competitive gaming may be a risk factor for decreasing prosocial behavior. We argue that replication is needed and that future research should better distinguish between different forms of gaming for more nuanced and generalizable insight.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine coaches’ psychophysiological and verbal responses to different game situations. The in-game heart rate and verbal responses of three elite ice hockey coaches to four critical game incidents (Goals For/Against; Penalties Taken/Drawn) over four university women’s games were assessed. Verbal comments were categorised using the Coach Behaviour Assessment System, and then comments and heart rate were sequenced to critical incidents recorded on video review. Overall, in-game heart rate was greater than rest and coaches were rarely silent. General encouragement and general commentary were the most common verbal comments. Two hundred and eight critical incident comments were recorded (Goals For/Against 34.6 %; Penalties Taken/Drawn 65.4%) associated with a 10 bpm greater heart rate. Most common verbal responses to critical incidents were general commentary, silence and organisation. The type of comment was affected by the type of critical incident. In 78% of critical incidents, the type of comment made before incidents differed to type of comment after the incident, coaches rarely talked at the same time and silence was common. These novel findings are limited to ice hockey coaches given the small sample size. However, these results should encourage more research into the psychophysiological and verbal responses of coaches in other team sports real game situations to better understand in game coaching behaviour.

AB  - Previous research on video gaming mainly focused on negative impact on users. In this study, the positive impact of action video gaming among congenitally deaf subjects is investigated. Subjects possessed high level of visual information processing capacity. A 96h of action video game play resulted in the improvement of mean reaction time (mRT) (post = 413.21 ms, pre = 453.39 ms) and certain cognitive functions. Higher heart rate variability (HRV) subjects demonstrated faster and significant improvement in mRT (p < 0.0045) after intervention. The α and β EEG band powers were found increased in parietal (6.33%, 4.28%) and occipital (8.38%, 38%) lobes respectively. The θ band power increased in frontal (32%) and parietal (13%) lobes. These results can reflect enhancement in certain cognitive performances such as visual perception, attention, memory, and motor skills. The ratio index β/(α + θ) increased in frontal and occipital lobes while β/θ increased in frontal and temporal lobes. These results may also suggest improvements in attention processing capacity and neural activity. These results implies improvements in certain aspects of cognition among deaf subjects. However, to validate these results a further study on larger number of samples with advanced computerized cognitive battery testing can be employed.

AB  - Playing violent video games have been linked to long-term emotional desensitization. We hypothesized that desensitization effects in excessive users of violent video games should lead to decreased brain activations to highly salient emotional pictures in emotional sensitivity brain regions. Twenty-eight male adult subjects showing excessive long-term use of violent video games and age and education matched control participants were examined in two experiments using standardized emotional pictures of positive, negative and neutral valence. No group differences were revealed even at reduced statistical thresholds which speaks against desensitization of emotion sensitive brain regions as a result of excessive use of violent video games.

AB  - This study examined parental mediation of children’s video game play in an Internet survey of 433 parents of children aged 5 to 18 years. We assessed the valence of active mediation (i.e., positive, negative, neutral) and the relationship between parental involvement and mediation techniques. Furthermore, we explored whether parental mediation was associated with child delinquency. Our results demonstrate that active mediation is generally negative or neutral in nature. Involved parents were more likely to use each mediation strategy than less involved parents; however, parental involvement did not predict negative mediation. Restrictive and negative mediation were significantly related to child delinquency. In sum, the findings show that parents are involved in monitoring their children’s use of this medium, just as they are with television. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objectives: Exer-games and virtual reality offer alternative opportunities to provide neuro-rehabilitation and exercise that are fun. Our goal was to determine how effective they are in achieving motor learning goals and fitness benefits as players gain experience. Design: We employed a repeated measures design to determine changes in physical exertion and engagement with training. Methods: Fourteen healthy adults trained on the XBOX Kinect video game Dance Central using a skill-based protocol to examine changes in energy expenditure (EE), heart rate (HR), METs, limb movement, game proficiency, and player engagement in initial, post-training, and transfer-testing of a full-body dance exer-game. Data were analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance, p < 0.05. Results: Both EE, HR, and METs increased from initial (EE 4.89 ± 1.35, HR 103 ± 18, METs 4.25 ± 0.72) to post-training (EE 5.92 ± 1.25, HR 110 ± 15, METs 5.05 ± 0.75) and were greatest during transfer-testing (EE 6.34 ± 1.35, HR 115 ± 17, METs 5.42 ± 0.88, p ≤ 0.001). Proficiency, measured by game scores, also increased from initial to post-training and transfer-testing (p ≤ 0.002). Limb movement and player engagement remained unchanged. Conclusions: It is important to understand whether player physiological and psychophysiological responses change with continued game-play. Although Dance Central involves whole-body movement, physical exertion remained at moderate levels after training. As exer-game and virtual reality systems move from their initial novelty, research about how players react to continued involvement with a game can guide game developers to maintain a freshness through game progression that preserves the participant's attentional focus, minimizes attrition and maintains a prescribed level of energy exertion.

AB  - Background: It is well established that birth weight has an effect on subsequent blood pressure. Predominantly experimental studies have also reported effects of altered corticosteroid levels on subsequent cardiovascular responses. In the current study, we have examined the effects of both birth weight and maternal cortisol levels in a cohort of mothers and their pre-adolescent children. Procedure: A total of 216 women and their 7- to 9-year-old children comprised the cohort. The women had been assessed for plasma cortisol during the first (n = 71), second (n = 72) and third (n = 73) trimester. Maternal cortisol had been measured on a fasting sample taken between 9 and 11 a.m. The children's blood pressure and heart rate were recorded in the resting state, in response to a 10-min video game stress challenge and during recovery. Resting values, incremental responses to stress and recovery were evaluated. Observation: Maternal cortisol levels increased with duration of pregnancy. There were inverse correlations between birth weight and all haemodynamic measures. The positive associations between maternal cortisol and children's haemodynamic measures were most evident in the first and second trimesters. Birth weight was inversely related to maternal cortisol. In multiple regression analyses, the effects of maternal cortisol were more consistent than those of birth weight. Conclusion: Both birth weight and maternal cortisol are predictive of children's resting and stress-modulated haemodynamic measures. The effects of birth weight may partly mediate the effects of maternal cortisol. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Gamification, the use of game elements in non-game contexts, has become a popular technique to improve instructional outcomes in both organizational and educational contexts. In the organizational context, the Technology-Enhanced Training Effectiveness Model [TETEM] provides a framework to understand how technologies, like gamification, can effect change in various instructional outcomes. Specifically, application of TETEM suggests that gamification may not effect change in instructional outcomes when learner attitudes towards game-based learning and experience with video games are low. Method: In this study, we test this model in the gamification context by assigning potential learners to read scenarios describing gamified instruction or traditional, PowerPoint instruction in a random order and assessing their training valence. Results: On average, participants anticipated greater value from gamified instruction, but as predicted by TETEM, this effect was moderated by both video game experience and attitudes towards game-based learning. Among potential learners with high experience and attitudes, gamification produces better outcomes than PowerPoint, but among potential learners with low experience and attitudes, gamification produces worse outcomes than PowerPoint. Implications: We provide empirical support for TETEM and conclude that for gamification to be successful, the attitudes and experience of participants must be assessed and ensured before gamification is implemented.

AB  - The expansion of the Internet and social media have triggered a differentiation of the word-of-mouth (WOM) concept, with consumer communication about brands and products now taking place in various settings and forms. Two important digital WOM types are microblogs and consumer reviews. To clarify their differential roles for product success, this study offers a theoretical framework of the influence of these two types of WOM, drawing from consumer information search theory and diffusion theory. The tests of the proposed framework use a longitudinal data set of video game sales and weekly information gathered from microblogs (i.e., over 13 million tweets from Twitter) and consumer reviews (i.e., more than 17,000 Amazon consumer reviews). Analyzing a system of equations provides evidence that the influence of microblogs and consumer reviews on new product success changes over time. Prior to launch, the volumes of microblogs and consumer reviews, together with advertising, represent primary sales drivers. After launch, the volume of microblogs is initially influential, then loses impact, whereas the impact of the volume of consumer reviews continues to grow. The valence of consumer reviews gains significance only near the end of the observation period, but the valence of microblogging is never influential.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the effect of playing a health video game embedded with story immersion, Escape from Diab (Diab), on children's diet and physical activity (PA) and to explore whether children immersed in Diab had greater positive outcomes. Design: Two groups, nonrandomized; 3 outcome assessments: at baseline, immediately after the game (post 1), and 8–10 weeks after the game (post 2). Participants: A total of 179 Chinese children aged 8–12 years. Intervention: The treatment group played Diab; the control group received no intervention. Main Outcome Measures: Motivation; self-efficacy; preference for fruit, vegetables, water, and PA; as well as PA behavior. Analysis: Adjusted changes to post 1 and post 2 by ANCOVA controlling for demographic and baseline variables. Results: Children who played Diab had increased intrinsic motivation for fruit and water, self-efficacy for PA, and self-reported PA scores at post 1 (all P < .05). Children with higher immersion scores (above the median) had increased intrinsic motivation for fruit and water, and autonomous and controlled motivation for PA at post 1 (all P < .05). However, these were not significant at post 2. Conclusions and Implications: Diab provides a promising innovative medium for promoting Chinese children's psychological correlates of diet and PA and PA behavior. However, its maintenance of effectiveness needs to be enhanced and mechanisms of change need to be investigated more thoroughly. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Behavioral adaptation is required for the successful navigation of a constantly changing environment. Impairments in behavioral flexibility are commonly observed in psychiatric disorders including those of addiction. This study investigates two distinct facets of compulsivity, namely reversal learning and attentional set shifting, implicating orbitofrontal and lateral prefrontal regions respectively, across disorders of primary and secondary rewards. Obese subjects with and without binge eating disorder (BED), individuals with compulsive sexual behaviors (CSB), alcohol dependence (AD) and pathological video-gaming (VG) were tested with two computerized tasks: the probabilistic reversal task (trials to criterion and win-stay/lose-shift errors) and the intra/extra-dimensional set shift task (IED). Individuals with AD and pathological VG were slower at reversal learning irrespective of valence, with AD subjects more likely to perseverate after losses. Compared to obese subjects without BED, BED subjects were worse at reversal learning to wins but better at losses highlighting valence effects as a function of binge eating. CSB subjects demonstrated enhanced sensitivity to reward outcomes with faster acquisition and greater perseveration with higher magnitude rewards. We further show an impairment in attentional set shifting in individuals with BED and AD relative to healthy volunteers (HV). This study provides evidence for commonalities and differences in two distinct dimensions of behavioral inflexibility across disorders of compulsivity. We summarize studies on compulsivity subtypes within this same patient population. We emphasize commonalities in AD and BED with impairments across a range of compulsivity indices, perhaps supporting pathological binge eating as a form of behavioral addiction. We further emphasize commonalities in reversal learning across disorders and the crucial role of valence effects. These findings highlight the role of behavioral inflexibility and compulsivity as a relevant domain in defining dimensional psychiatry and the identification of relevant cognitive endophenotypes as targets for therapeutic modulation.

AB  - In line with Allen Newell's challenge to develop complete cognitive architectures, and motivated by a recent proposal for a unifying subsymbolic computational theory of cognition, we introduce the cognitive control architecture SEMLINCS. SEMLINCS models the development of an embodied cognitive agent that learns discrete production rule‐like structures from its own, autonomously gathered, continuous sensorimotor experiences. Moreover, the agent uses the developing knowledge to plan and control environmental interactions in a versatile, goal‐directed, and self‐motivated manner. Thus, in contrast to several well‐known symbolic cognitive architectures, SEMLINCS is not provided with production rules and the involved symbols, but it learns them. In this paper, the actual implementation of SEMLINCS causes learning and self‐motivated, autonomous behavioral control of the game figure Mario in a clone of the computer game Super Mario Bros. Our evaluations highlight the successful development of behavioral versatility as well as the learning of suitable production rules and the involved symbols from sensorimotor experiences. Moreover, knowledge‐ and motivation‐dependent individualizations of the agents’ behavioral tendencies are shown. Finally, interaction sequences can be planned on the sensorimotor‐grounded production rule level. Current limitations directly point toward the need for several further enhancements, which may be integrated into SEMLINCS in the near future. Overall, SEMLINCS may be viewed as an architecture that allows the functional and computational modeling of embodied cognitive development, whereby the current main focus lies on the development of production rules from sensorimotor experiences.

AB  - Objective: To test how three custom-built balancing algorithms minimize differences in game success, time above 40% heart rate reserve (HRR), and enjoyment between youth with cerebral palsy (CP) who have different gross motor function capabilities. Youth at Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) level II (unassisted walking) and level III (mobility aids needed for walking) competed in a cycling-based exercise video game that tested three balancing algorithms. Materials and Methods: Three algorithms: a control (generic-balancing [GB]), a constant non-person specific (One-Speed-For-All [OSFA]), and a person-specific (Target-Cadence [TC]) algorithms were built. In this prospective repeated measures intervention trial with randomized and blinded algorithm assignment, 10 youth with CP aged 10–16 years (X ± standard deviation = 12.4 ± 1.8 years; GMFCS level II n = 4, III n = 6) played six exergaming sessions using each of the three algorithms. Outcomes included game success as measured by a normalized game score, time above 40% HRR, and enjoyment. Results: The TC algorithm balanced game success between GMFCS levels similarly to GB (P = 0.11) and OSFA (P = 0.41). TC showed poorer balancing in time above 40% HRR compared to GB (P = 0.02) and OSFA (P = 0.02). Enjoyment ratings were high (6.4 ± 0.7/7) and consistent between all algorithms (TC vs. GB: P = 0.80 and TC vs. OSFA: P = 0.19). Conclusion: TC shows promise in balancing game success and enjoyment but improvements are needed to balance between GMFCS levels for cardiovascular exercise.

AB  - Two experimental studies using Elliot, Murayama, and Pekrun’s (Journal of Educational Psychology 103(3):632–648, 2011) differentiation between self-goals and task-goals, were conducted to examine the relative influence of achievement goals and motivational contexts on behavioral and emotional engagement. In Study 1, 133 college students were prompted to adopt self-goals (intrapersonal standards) or other-goals (performance standards) in one of two motivational contexts (autonomy-supportive or autonomy-suppressive) while playing a computer game. In Study 2, 129 college students performed the same assignment, this time adopting either other-goals or task-goals (absolute standards). Study 1 indicated that autonomy-support facilitated behavioral and emotional engagement in autonomy suppressive contexts, but self-goals merely promoted emotional engagement relative to other-goals. Study 2 replicated Study 1’s findings by showing that autonomy support promoted self-reported behavioral engagement and task-goals promoted emotional engagement but further revealed that only when task-goals were adopted in an autonomy-supportive context did they promote better behavioral engagement than other-goals. Thus, Study 2 highlighted the importance of the context in which the achievement goals were adopted (i.e., autonomy-supportive versus suppressive) as an important determinant of the outcome.

AB  - As Internet use grows, so do the benefits and also the risks. Thus, it is important to identify when individuals' Internet use is problematic. In the present study, 449 participants aged from 16 to 71 years of age were sourced from a wide range of English-speaking Internet forums, including social media and self-help groups. Of these, 68.9% were classified as nonproblematic users, 24.4% as problematic users, and 6.7% as addictive Internet users. High use of discussion forums, high rumination levels, and low levels of self-care were the main contributing factors to Internet addiction (IA) among adolescents. For adults IA was mainly predicted through engagement in online video gaming and sexual activity, low email use, as well as high anxiety and high avoidant coping. Problematic Internet users scored higher on emotion and avoidance coping responses in adults and higher on rumination and lower on self-care in adolescents. Avoidance coping responses mediated the relationship between psychological distress and IA. These findings may assist clinicians with designing interventions to target different factors associated with IA. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - We feel as if we exist in a virtual reality (VR) world especially when our actions are directly projected on a Computer Graphics (CG) character in the VR world. Such feelings are said to be achieved by a sense of ownership for the CG characters. Previous research suggests that the synchronicity between somatosensory input and visual information are crucial to attain this sense of ownership. Although several studies have investigated the temporal synchronizations between actual and virtual actions, no study has assessed how the discrepancies in the correspondence between these actions affect the emergence of a sense of ownership. In the present study, we employed a 'rock-paper-scissors' game task in a VR world in which the players' actions (i.e., rock, paper, or scissors) were projected onto the actions of a CG character with zero (0%), low (33%), moderate (66%), or total (100%) correspondences. Total correspondence indicated complete synchronization between the actions of the player and the CG character, i.e., when the player produced one of the three actions (rock, paper, or scissors), the CG character produced the same action. In the zero correspondence condition, their actions did not coincide, i.e., when the player produced one of the three actions, the CG character strictly produced different actions. The results showed that a sense of agency in terms of the subjective reports increased as a function of the correspondences between the player's and CG character's actions. As a probe test, after each 100 trial, games of a correspondence condition were introduced, in which the CG character's arm was suddenly almost cut by a Japanese sword. A survey after completion of the task revealed that the sense of agency increased as a function of the correspondences. This suggested that the synchronizations of the actions are crucial for attaining a sense of ownership, as well as increase the sense of agency. In contrast, the systolic blood pressure increased only after the total correspondence condition, and was higher than those observed in the other three correspondence conditions, suggesting that any subtle decrement in correspondence does not produce a seusse of ownership, as assessed by the physiological indicator. In other words, there was a discrepancy between the psychological and physiological sense of ownership at the moderate contingency condition. A temporal de-synchronization may produce a sense of ownership; however, any decrement in the correspondence between actual and virtual actions is insufficient to evoke a sense of ownership.

AB  - The percentage of older adults who are active gamers has increased tremendously in recent years. Although research shows that video games enhance physical and cognitive well-being in older adults, the role of video games in enhancing social interactions has been relatively understudied. We examined the habits, preferences, motivations, and outcomes of video gameplay among older and younger adults who play games with their family members. The findings reveal that sharing in video games does foster relationships and connections while producing positive emotions for both generations. As a consequence, game designers should take into consideration ways to enhance these social aspects of gameplay. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this article is to explore learners’ perceptions of using virtual patients in a behavioral medicine Massive Open Online Course (MOOCs) and thereby describe innovative ways of disseminating knowledge in health-related areas.Methods: A 5-week MOOC on behavioral medicine was hosted on the edX platform. The authors developed two branched virtual patients consisting of video recordings of a live standardized patient, with multiple clinical decision points and narration unfolding depending on learners’ choices. Students interacted with the virtual patients to treat stress and sleep problems. Answers to the exit survey and participant comments from the discussion forum were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively.Results: In total, 19,236 participants enrolled in the MOOC, out of which 740 received the final certificate. The virtual patients were completed by 2317 and 1640 participants respectively. Among survey respondents (n = 442), 83.1% agreed that the virtual patient exercise was helpful. The qualitative analysis resulted in themes covering what it was like to work with the virtual patient, with subthemes on learner-centered education, emotions/eustress, game comparisons, what the participants learned, what surprised them, how confident participants felt about applying interventions in practice, suggestions for improvement, and previous experiences of virtual patients.Conclusions: Students were enthusiastic about interacting with the virtual patients as a means to apply new knowledge about behavioral medicine interventions. The most common suggestion was to incorporate more interactive cases with various levels of complexity. Further research should include patient outcomes and focus on interprofessional aspects of learning with virtual patients in a MOOC. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This article reviews scientific advances in the prevention and treatment of substance-use disorder and related developments in public policy. Here we review recent advances in the neurobiology of addiction to clarify the link between addiction and brain function and to broaden the understanding of addiction as a brain disease. We review findings on the desensitization of reward circuits, which dampens the ability to feel pleasure and the motivation to pursue everyday activities; the increasing strength of conditioned responses and stress reactivity, which results in increased cravings for alcohol and other drugs and negative emotions when these cravings are not sated; and the weakening of the brain regions involved in executive functions such as decision making, inhibitory control, and self-regulation that leads to repeated relapse. Advances in neurobiology have begun to clarify the mechanisms underlying the profound disruptions in decision-making ability and emotional balance displayed by persons with drug addiction. These advances also provide insight into the ways in which fundamental biologic processes, when disrupted, can alter voluntary behavioral control, not just in drug addiction but also in other, related disorders of self-regulation, such as obesity and pathologic gambling and video-gaming — the so-called behavioral addictions.

AB  - Voluntary help during a time of need fosters interpersonal gratitude, which has positive social and personal consequences such as improved social relationships, increased reciprocity, and decreased distress. In a behavioral and a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment, participants played a multiround interactive game where they received pain stimulation. An anonymous partner interacted with the participants and either intentionally or unintentionally (i.e., determined by a computer program) bore part of the participants’ pain. In each round, participants either evaluated their perceived pain intensity (behavioral experiment) or transferred an amount of money to the partner (fMRI experiment). Intentional (relative to unintentional) help led to lower experience of pain, higher reciprocity (money allocation), and increased interpersonal closeness toward the partner. fMRI revealed that for the most grateful condition (i.e., intentional help), value-related structures such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) showed the highest activation in response to the partner’s decision, whereas the primary sensory area and the anterior insula exhibited the lowest activation at the pain delivery stage. Moreover, the vmPFC activation was predictive of the individual differences in reciprocal behavior, and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) activation was predictive of self-reported gratitude. Furthermore, using multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), we showed that the neural activation pattern in the septum/hypothalamus, an area associated with affiliative affect and social bonding, and value-related structures specifically and sensitively dissociated intentional help from unintentional help conditions. These findings contribute to our understanding of the psychological and neural substrates of the experience of interpersonal gratitude and the social consequences of this emotion.

AB  - The current research examines the persuasive effects of reciprocity in the context of human–robot interaction. This is an important theoretical and practical extension of persuasive robotics by testing (1) if robots can utilize verbal requests and (2) if robots can utilize persuasive mechanisms (e.g., reciprocity) to gain human compliance. Participants played a trivia game with a robot teammate. The ostensibly autonomous robot helped (or failed to help) the participants by providing the correct (vs. incorrect) trivia answers. Then, the robot directly asked participants to complete a 15-minute task for pattern recognition. Compared to no help, results showed that a robot's prior helping behavior significantly increased the likelihood of compliance (60 percent vs. 33 percent). Interestingly, participants' evaluations toward the robot (i.e., competence, warmth, and trustworthiness) did not predict compliance. These results also provided an insightful comparison showing that participants complied at similar rates with the robot and with computer agents. This result documents a clear empirically powerful potential for the role of verbal messages in persuasive robotics. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

The list of author names was incorrect in the original online and print publications. The correct list of author names for this article should appear as: Selma Yilmazyildiz, Robin Read, Tony Belpaeme, and Werner Verhelst.] As a young and emerging field in social human–robot interaction (HRI), semantic-free utterances (SFUs) research has been receiving attention over the last decade. SFUs are an auditory interaction means for machines that allow emotion and intent expression, which are composed of vocalizations and sounds without semantic content or language dependence. Currently, SFUs are most commonly utilized in animation movies (e.g., R2-D2, WALL-E, Despicable Me), cartoons (e.g., 'Teletubbies,' 'Morph,' 'La Linea'), and computer games (e.g., The Sims) and hold significant potential for applications in HRI. SFUs are categorized under four general types: Gibberish Speech (GS), Non-Linguistic Utterances (NLUs), Musical Utterances (MU), and Paralinguistic Utterances (PU). By introducing the concept of SFUs and bringing multiple sets of studies in social HRI that have never been analyzed jointly before, this article addresses the need for a comprehensive study of the existing literature for SFUs. It outlines the current grand challenges, open questions, and provides guidelines for future researchers considering to utilize SFU in social HRI.

AB  - Objective: To study cardiac, sleep-related, and emotional reactions to playing violent (VG) versus nonviolent video games (NVG) in adolescents with different gaming habits. Methods: Thirty boys (aged 13-16 years, standard deviation = 0.9), half of them low-exposed (≤ 1 h/d) and half high-exposed (≥ 3 h/d) to violent games, played a VG/NVG for 2 hours during two different evenings in their homes. Heart rate (HR) and HR variability were registered from before start until next morning. A questionnaire about emotional reactions was administered after gaming sessions and a sleep diary on the following mornings. Results: During sleep, there were significant interaction effects between group and gaming condition for HR (means [standard errors] for low-exposed: NVG 63.8 [2.2] and VG 67.7 [2.4]; for high-exposed: NVG 65.5 [1.9] and VG 62.7 [1.9]; F(1,28) = 9.22, p = .005). There was also a significant interaction for sleep quality (low-exposed: NVG 4.3 [0.2] and VG 3.7 [0.3]); high-exposed: NVG 4.4 [0.2] and VG 4.4 [0.2]; F(1,28) = 3.51, p = .036, one sided), and sadness after playing (low-exposed: NVG 1.0 [0.0] and VG 1.4 [0.2]; high-exposed: NVG 1.2 [0.1] and VG 1.1 [0.1]; (F(1,27) = 6.29, p = .009, one sided). Conclusions: Different combinations of the extent of (low versus high) previous VG and experimental exposure to a VG or an NVG are associated with different reaction patterns—physiologically, emotionally, and sleep related. Desensitizing effects or selection bias stand out as possible explanations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Expertise within gaming (e.g., chess, video games) and kinesthetic (e.g., sports, classical dance) activities has been found to be linked with specific cognitive skills. Some of these skills, working memory, mental rotation, problem solving, are linked to higher performance in science, technology, math, and engineering (STEM) disciplines. In the present study, we examined whether experience in a different activity, hip hop dance, is also linked to cognitive abilities connected with STEM skills as well as social cognition ability. Dancers who varied in hip hop and other dance style experience were presented with a set of computerized tasks that assessed working memory capacity, mental rotation speed, problem solving efficiency, and theory of mind. We found that, when controlling for demographic factors and other dance style experience, those with greater hip hop dance experience were faster at mentally rotating images of hands at greater angle disparities and there was a trend for greater accuracy at identifying positive emotions displayed by cropped images of human faces. We suggest that hip hop dance, similar to other more technical activities such as video gameplay, tap some specific cognitive abilities that underlie STEM skills. Furthermore, we suggest that hip hop dance experience can be used to reach populations who may not otherwise be interested in other kinesthetic or gaming activities and potentially enhance select sociocognitive skills.

AB  - Objective: Active video games (AVGs) transform the sedentary screen time of video gaming into active screen time and have great potential to serve as a 'gateway' tool to a more active lifestyle for the least active individuals. This pilot randomized trial was conducted to explore the potential of theory-guided active video games in increasing moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) among young adults. Method: In this pilot 4-week intervention, participants were randomly assigned to 1 of the following groups: an AVG group with all the self determination theory (SDT)–based game features turned off, an AVG group with all the SDT-based game features turned on, a passive gameplay group with all the SDT-based game features turned on, and a control group. Physical activity was measured using ActiGraph GT3X accelerometers. Other outcomes included attendance and perceived need satisfaction of autonomy, competence and relatedness. Results: It was found that playing the self-determination theory supported AVG resulted in greater MVPA compared with the control group immediately postintervention. The AVG with the theory-supported features also resulted in greater attendance and psychological need satisfaction than the non–theory-supported one. Conclusion: An AVG designed with motivation theory informed features positively impacted attendance and MVPA immediately postintervention, suggesting that including AVG features guided with motivation theory may be a method of addressing common problems with adherence and increasing effectiveness of active gaming.

AB  - Objective: In 2013, the American Psychiatric Association included Internet Gaming Disorder in the diagnostic manual as a condition which requires further research, indicating the scientific and clinical community are aware of potential health concerns as a consequence of excessive Internet use. From a clinical point of view, it appears that excessive/addictive Internet use is often comorbid with further psychopathologies and assessing comorbidity is relevant in clinical practice, treatment outcome and prevention as the probability to become addicted to using the Internet accelerates with additional (sub)clinical symptoms. Moreover, research indicates individuals play computer games excessively to cope with everyday stressors and to regulate their emotions by applying media-focused coping strategies, suggesting pathological computer game players play in order to relieve stress and to avoid daily hassles. The aims of this research were to replicate and extend previous findings and explanations of the complexities of the relationships between excessive Internet use and Internet addiction, psychopathology and dysfunctional coping strategies. Method: Participants included 681 Polish university students sampled using an online battery of validated psychometric instruments. Results: Results of structural equation models revealed dysfunctional coping strategies (i.e., distraction, denial, self-blame, substance use, venting, media use, and behavioural disengagement) significantly predict excessive Internet use, and the data fit the theoretical model well. A second SEM showed media-focused coping and substance use coping significantly mediate the relationship between psychopathology (operationalised via the Global Severity Index) and excessive Internet use. Conclusions: The findings lend support to the self-medication hypothesis of addictive disorders, and suggest psychopathology and dysfunctional coping have additive effects on excessive Internet use.

AB  - Violence exposure has drawn lots of researchers' attention recently, for violent incidents in social life has increased significantly. It is believed that violence exposure in daily lives may result in aggressive behaviors and repeated exposure to violence may even alter individual's cognitive, affective, and behavioral processes. Exposure to violence may change personal emotions, behavior and cognition by causing physical arousal, strengthening negative emotion and finally making him aggressive. While these results are widely accepted, most of the former researchers mainly put their focus on the effects of fictitious violence such as violent video games and violent TV programs, few are put on daily lives. Beliefs about aggression refer to individuals' perception of whether aggression is acceptable or not when settling disputes and expressing hatred. It also has a close correlation with aggressive behaviors. Previous studies showed there was a negative correlation between interpersonal trust and aggressive behavior. Therefore, interpersonal trust may work as a moderator in the mediation effect of beliefs about aggression. The current study examined the relationship between violence exposure in real-life and aggressive behaviors. In addition, we investigated whether this relationship was mediated by beliefs about aggression and whether interpersonal trust moderated the relationship between violence exposure and aggressive behaviors mediated by beliefs about aggression. 850 college students, among whom 476 were males and 374 were females, participated our experiment for monetary compensation. Violence Exposure Questionnaire, Normative Beliefs about Aggression Scale, Interpersonal Trust Scale, and the Aggression Questionnaire were used. We also analyzed roles of beliefs about aggression and interpersonal trust playing between violence exposure and aggressive behavior. After reviewing the previous literature, we assumed that beliefs about aggression were considered as mediator and interpersonal trust as moderator. The results were as follows: (1) There was a strong positive correlation between violence exposure in daily surroundings with beliefs about aggression and aggressive behaviors. There was a strong positive correlation between beliefs about aggression and aggressive behaviors. There was a strong negative correlation between interpersonal trust and aggressive behaviors. (2) Beliefs about aggression played a partial mediation role in the relationship between violence exposure in real-life and aggressive behaviors. (3) Interpersonal trust moderated the mediation effect of beliefs about aggression. For individuals with high interpersonal trust, the mediating effect of beliefs about aggression was not significant, and violence exposure in daily surroundings only had a direct effect on aggressive behaviors. For individuals with low interpersonal trust, beliefs about aggression partially played a mediation role in the relationship between violence exposure in real-life and aggressive behaviors. (4) There was a moderated mediation model including violence exposure in real-life, beliefs about aggression, interpersonal trust and aggressive behaviors. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that all fit indexes conformed to statistical requirements. The current study investigated the effects of violence exposure in real-life on one's aggressive behavior through its mechanism, the mediating effects of aggressive behaviors, roles of beliefs about aggression and interpersonal trust in the purpose of prompting more relevant studies on violence exposure in real-life and aggressive behaviors.

AB  - Introduction: Computer games have attracted remarkable attentions in general publics with different cultures and their effects are subject of research by cognitive neuroscientists. In the present study, possible effects of the game Fifa 2015 on cognitive performance, hormonal levels, and electroencephalographic (EEG) signals were evaluated in young male volunteers. Methods: Thirty two subjects aged 20 years on average participated mutually in playing computer game Fifa 2015. Identification information and general knowledge about the game were collected. Saliva samples from the contestants were obtained before and after the competition. Perceptive and cognitive performance including the general cognitive health, response delay, attention maintenance, and mental fatigue were measured using PASAT test. EEG were recorded during the play using EEG device and analyzed later using QEEG. Simultaneously, the players’ behavior were recorded using a video camera. Saliva cortisol levels were assessed by ELISA kit. Data were analyzed by SPSS program. Results: The impact of playing computer games on cortisol concentration of saliva before and after the game showed that the amount of saliva plasma after playing the game has dropped significantly. Also the impact of playing computer games on mental health, before and after the game indicated that the number of correct answers has not changed significantly. This indicates that sustained attention has increased in participants after the game in comparison with before that. Also it is shown that mental fatigue measured by PASAT test, did not changed significantly after the game in comparison to before that. The impact of game on changes in brain waves showed that the subjects in high activity state during playing the game had higher power of the EEG signals in most of the channels in lower frequency bands in compared to normal state. Discussion: The present study showed that computer games can positively affect the stress system and the perceptual-cognitive system. Even though this impact was not significant in most cases, the changes in cognitive and hormonal test and also in brain waves were visible. Hence, due to the importance of this matter, it is necessary to create control systems in selecting the types of games for playing. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The effects of videogame play is a growing research field in the recent decades, however, little is known about how ‘out-of-school’ use of videogames influences creativity and emotions. This interdisciplinary study employed a within-participant design to explore the effects of two different types of online videogames (an action videogame and a non-action videogame) on subsequent creativity performance measured using an idea generation task and emotional responses. Results showed that after playing the action game participants performed higher on originality, elaboration and flexibility than after playing the non-action game, but not productivity. Furthermore, playing both types of game elicited positive emotion (i.e., pleasantness) high in approach motivation (i.e., desire). However, action video game play elicited higher arousal and stress than non-action videogame play. The current research suggests that the relationships between the quantity (productivity and flexibility) and the quality (in this paper, originality and elaboration) of creativity performance may be complex and emotional response of arousal might be a significant emotional factor which influences subsequent creativity performance after videogame play. The cognitive and emotional effects of videogames are discussed along with implications for future emotion–creativity–videogame research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: To determine whether the amount of time spent in screen-based behaviors (SBBs; television viewing, computer use, and playing electronic games) is independently associated with individual and clustered cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors among elementary school children. Study design: Baseline data were used from 264 children (age 7-10 years) participating in the Transform-Us! cluster-randomized controlled trial. Time (h/d) spent in SBBs was obtained using a parent proxy-report questionnaire. Anthropometrics, blood pressure (BP), and lipids were measured using standard techniques. A clustered CVD risk score was calculated as the average of the standardized values of the subcomponents (waist circumference [WC], systolic BP, diastolic BP, and lipids). Results: After adjusting for sex, parent education, physical activity (accelerometry), diet, and WC (when adiposity was not the outcome), television viewing time was positively associated with body mass index z-score (P = .002), WC (P = .02), and systolic BP (P = .05). Electronic games was positively associated with low density lipoprotein levels (P = .05), and total screen-time was positively associated with body mass index (P = .02). Conclusions: Differential associations were observed between types of SBBs and CVD risk factors, indicating that not all SBBs are adversely associated with obesity and CVD risk. There is a need to differentiate between types of SBBs when evaluating the CVD risk associated with screen behaviors in children. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Racing games have emerged as top-selling products in the video and computer game industry. The effect of playing racing games on the inclination of gamers to take risks has been investigated. Method: Two experiments were conducted. In experiment 1, the impact of personality traits on the effects of playing racing games on risk-taking inclination was examined. The Vienna Test System, which includes the Eysenck Personality Profile Test and the Vienna Risk- Taking Test, was used to measure risk-taking inclination and risk-taking while driving. Experiment 2 was designed and conducted to analyse the effects of different intensity levels of car racing games on risktaking inclination, and to study the relationship between physiological data and risk-taking inclination. Physiological data on skin conductance, heart rate and blood pressure were measured with the NeuroDyne System. Results: Participants playing a racing game were more inclined to take risks in critical road traffic situations than those playing a neutral game. The adventurousness dimension of the Eysenck Personality Profile Test correlated significantly positively with risk-taking inclination. More importantly, the effect of the intensity level of a racing game on risk-taking inclination was significant. The higher the intensity level of the racing game, the higher the risk-taking inclination while driving. The effect of intensity level of the racing game on skin conductance was significantly positive. Skin conductance correlated significantly positively with risktaking inclination. Conclusions: The effect of playing racing games on risk-taking inclination is linked to personality and physiological data. Some recommendations are proposed as a result of this study for racing game management. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are often characterized by disruptive behavior problems and there are few effective interventions available. GoFAR is a novel, 3‐part intervention designed to improve self‐regulation and adaptive living skills of children with FASD by improving metacognitive control of emotions and arousal. Methods: The intervention has 3 components: (i) GoFAR: a 'serious game' designed to teach a metacognitive control strategy in a computer game environment; (ii) parent training on child behavioral regulation; and (iii) Behavior Analog Therapy (BAT) sessions, a practical application of the metacognitive learning methodology by parent and child in the context of learning adaptive skills. The learning strategy (FAR) teaches the child to Focus and make a plan, Act out the plan, and Reflect back on the plan. Thirty families were randomized to 3 groups: (i) GoFAR (n = 10); (ii) FACELAND (n = 10); or (iii) CONTROL (n = 10). The 2 intervention groups, GoFAR and FACELAND, used computer games to instruct children. Both groups also received 5 sessions of parent training followed by 5 sessions of joint parent/child therapy (BAT). Assessment of disruptive behavior, including frequency of temper tantrums, frustration tolerance, impulsivity, destructiveness, aggression, and maintaining attention were carried out before enrollment at Mid‐Treatment, when game play and parent training were completed, and finally, after completing the BAT sessions. Results: Parental report of disruptive behavior overall was significantly reduced in the GoFAR group after the first components, game play and parent training, and after the BAT sessions in the FACELAND group with no changes in the CONTROL group over time. Conclusions: The GoFAR® game was well received by children and effective in teaching the required skills. Mastering the FAR metacognitive strategy was associated with a reduction in disruptive behaviors in children with FASD suggesting that effective interventions can improve outcomes for this high‐risk group.

AB  - Objective: We examined the impact of priming on operator trust and system performance when supervising a decentralized network of heterogeneous unmanned vehicles (UVs). Background: Advances in autonomy have enabled a future vision of single-operator control of multiple heterogeneous UVs. Real-time scheduling for multiple UVs in uncertain environments requires the computational ability of optimization algorithms combined with the judgment and adaptability of human supervisors. Because of system and environmental uncertainty, appropriate operator trust will be instrumental to maintain high system performance and prevent cognitive overload. Method: Three groups of operators experienced different levels of trust priming prior to conducting simulated missions in an existing, multiple-UV simulation environment. Results: Participants who play computer and video games frequently were found to have a higher propensity to overtrust automation. By priming gamers to lower their initial trust to a more appropriate level, system performance was improved by 10% as compared to gamers who were primed to have higher trust in the automation. Conclusion: Priming was successful at adjusting the operator’s initial and dynamic trust in the automated scheduling algorithm, which had a substantial impact on system performance. Application: These results have important implications for personnel selection and training for futuristic multi-UV systems under human supervision. Although gamers may bring valuable skills, they may also be potentially prone to automation bias. Priming during training and regular priming throughout missions may be one potential method for overcoming this propensity to overtrust automation.

AB  - Eye behavior metrics, time of run, and subjective survey results were assessed during human-computer interaction with high, low, and intermediate system autonomy levels. The results of this study are provided as a contribution to knowledge on the relationship between cognitive workload physiology and automation. Research suggests that changes in eye behavior metrics are related to changes in cognitive workload. Few studies have investigated the relationship between eye behavior metrics physiology measures and levels of automation. A within-subjects experiment involving 18 participants who played an open-source real-time strategy game was conducted. Three different versions of the game were developed, each with a unique static autonomy level designed from Sheridan and Verplank's 10 levels of autonomy (levels 2, 4, and 9). NASA-TLX subject survey ratings, time to complete run, and visual fixation rate were found to be significantly different among automation levels. These findings suggest that assessing visual physiology may be a promising indicator for evaluating cognitive workload when interacting with static autonomy levels. This efforts takes us one step closer to using visual physiology as a useful method for evaluating operator workload in almost real-time. Relevance to industry: Potential applications of this research include development of software that integrates adaptive automation to improve human-computer task performance for high cognitive workload tasks (Air Traffic Control, aircraft piloting, process control, information analyst, etc.).

AB  - The use of serious games to promote social skills in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been a focus of interest during the past 10 years. We begin with a review of the literature regarding serious games proposed for individuals with ASD that focus on emotion processing. We found a total of 16 games but their overall quality was often limited both in terms of design/playability and clinical interest/efficacy. Additionally the study of emotion production was absent with the games being focused on emotion recognition. Second, we describe the design principles and the computational architecture of a novel serious game, JEMImE, that aims to promote uni and bimodal emotion production in individuals with ASD. We detail the technological gap and the need to compute an automated algorithm able to recognize emotion in real time in order to give feed-back to the player. This algorithm will be designed based on machine learning principles. To achieve this goal, we created a video database including more than 150 children and adolescents with typical development who were producing emotion.

Après une revue de la littérature concernant les jeux sérieux focalisés sur la reconnaissance des émotions ayant été proposés et utilisés avec des personnes autistes, nous décrirons l’architecture d’un nouveau jeu sérieux JEMImE dont l’objectif est de travailler la production émotionnelle uni et bimodale en contexte social. Nous décrirons le principal verrou technologique, à savoir la programmation d’un algorithme de reconnaissance émotionnelle capable de donner en temps réel un feed-back au joueur. Cet algorithme sera développé suivant des principes d’apprentissage machine sur une base de données d’émotions produites par des enfants tout-venant recrutés dans des écoles et spécifiquement créée pour le projet.

AB  - Background: Exposure to media violence might have detrimental effects on psychological adjustment and is associated with aggression-related attitudes and behaviors. As a result, many media literacy programs were implemented to tackle that major public health issue. However, there is little evidence about their effectiveness. Evaluating design effectiveness, particularly regarding targeting process, would prevent adverse effects and improve the evaluation of evidence-based media literacy programs. Objectives: The present research examined whether or not different relational lifestyles may explain the different effects of an antiviolence intervention program. Research design: Based on relational and lifestyles theory, the authors designed a randomized controlled trial and applied an analysis of variance 2 (treatment: experimental vs. control) × 4 (lifestyle classes emerged from data using latent class analysis: communicative vs. autonomous vs. meta-reflexive vs. fractured). Subjects: Seven hundred and thirty-five Italian students distributed in 47 classes participated anonymously in the research (51.3% females). Measures Participants completed a lifestyle questionnaire as well as their attitudes and behavioral intentions as the dependent measures. Results: The results indicated that the program was effective in changing adolescents’ attitudes toward violence. However, behavioral intentions toward consumption of violent video games were moderated by lifestyles. Those with communicative relational lifestyles showed fewer intentions to consume violent video games, while a boomerang effect was found among participants with problematic lifestyles. Conclusion: Adolescents’ lifestyles played an important role in influencing the effectiveness of an intervention aimed at changing behavioral intentions toward the consumption of violent video games. For that reason, audience lifestyle segmentation analysis should be considered an essential technique for designing, evaluating, and improving media literacy programs.

AB  - This article discuses the emerging application of health information technology in child and adolescent psychiatry. Several articles in this issue describe patient-facing digital technologies. For example, Schueller and his colleagues incorporate research findings regarding child-computer interaction and game theory in the consideration of online mental health treatment and virtual therapists for children and adolescents. Archangeli and colleagues summarize the current state of evidence regarding the effectiveness and feasibility of smartphone apps in child and adolescent psychiatry in their systematic review. Looking at specific disorders, Darcy and Lock describe the use of technological solutions to support family-based treatment of anorexia nervosa and bulimia and summarize pilot data regarding patient experience and effectiveness. In their article regarding patient portals, Kendrick and Benson consider the opportunities and risks associated with this technology in consideration of adolescent needs for autonomy and privacy. The final three articles in the issue address overarching and systems level issues pertaining to the use of health information technology in the field of child and adolescent psychiatry.

AB  - Epidemics of respiratory infectious disease remain one of the most serious health risks facing the population. Non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g. hand-washing or wearing face masks) can have a significant impact on the course of an infectious disease epidemic. The current study investigated whether protection motivation theory (PMT) is a useful framework for understanding social distancing behaviour (i.e. the tendency to reduce social contacts) in response to a simulated infectious disease epidemic. There were 230 participants (109 males, 121 females, mean age 32.4 years) from the general population who completed self-report measures assessing the components of PMT. In addition, participants completed a computer game which simulated an infectious disease epidemic in order to provide a measure of social distancing behaviour. The regression analyses revealed that none of the PMT variables were significant predictors of social distancing behaviour during the simulation task. However, fear (β = .218, p < .001), response efficacy (β = .175, p < .01) and self-efficacy (β = .251, p < .001) were all significant predictors of intention to engage in social distancing behaviour. Overall, the PMT variables (and demographic factors) explain 21.2% of the variance in intention. The findings demonstrated that PMT was a useful framework for understanding intention to engage in social distancing behaviour, but not actual behaviour during the simulated epidemic. These findings may reflect an intention-behaviour gap in relation to social distancing behaviour. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Affective disturbance is a central feature of bipolar disorder. Many investigators have hypothesized that euthymic people with bipolar disorder might display elevated emotional reactivity, but laboratory studies of emotional reactivity have had mixed results. Drawing on theories of bipolar disorder that emphasize dysregulation of goal pursuit, we hypothesized that people with bipolar disorder might be emotionally hyperreactive to frustration of goal pursuit. Forty-seven euthymic participants with bipolar disorder and 43 control participants played a computer game for a monetary reward. To induce frustration, we programmed the game to respond inconsistently to user input during two periods. The frustration induction was successful as measured by self-report, physiological responding, and facial behavior, but contrary to the hypothesis of emotional hyperreactivity in bipolar disorder, the bipolar and control groups were equally reactive to frustration. Future studies will benefit from more specific hypotheses about how emotion might be altered in bipolar disorder. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Today’s pediatric health care lacks methods to tap into the emotional state of hospitalized pediatric patients (age 4–6 years). The most frequently used approaches were developed for adults and fail to acknowledge the importance of imaginary experiences and the notion of play that may appeal to children. The scope of this article is to introduce a new design-oriented method of gathering information about the emotional state of pediatric patients using an experimental computer game called the Child Patient game (CPgame). The CPgame was developed at a Danish hospital, and the results of the preliminary tests show that games could serve as a system in which children are willing to express their emotions through play. The results are based on two comparative analyses of the CPgame through which it is possible to identify three different types of players among the patients playing the game. Furthermore, the data reveal that pediatric patients display a radically different play pattern than children who are not in hospital. The inquiry takes an interdisciplinary approach; it has obvious health care-related objectives and seeks to meet the urgent need for new methods within health care to optimize communication with young children. At the same time, design research (i.e., the development of new knowledge through the development of a new design) heavily impacts the method.

AB  - Computer systems are a part of everyday life, since they influence human behavior and stimulate changes in the emotional states of the users. The assessment of users’ emotions during their interaction with computer systems can help to provide tailorable website interfaces and better recommendations systems. However, emotions are complex and difficult to identify or assess. Previous studies have shown that, in a real-world scenario, the use of single sensors do not provide an accurate emotional assessment. Hence, in this study, we propose a framework that takes into account multiple sensors so that conclusions can be drawn about the emotional state of the user at the time of interaction. The proposed multi-sensing approach includes several inputs from users (such as speech, facial movements, and everyday activities), and uses an artificial intelligent strategy to map these different responses into one or more emotional states. The Componential Emotion Theory and Scherer's Emotional Semantic Space are used to underpin the theoretical framework. The experimental results show that the combination of outputs generated by multiple sensors provides a more accurate assessment of emotional states than when the sensors are treated individually.

AB  - Objective: This study evaluated the cardiometabolic, behavioral, and psychosocial factors associated with weight status among hospital employees. Methods: A total of n = 924 employees across the six hospitals in Texas participated in this cross-sectional study, 2012 to 2013. Association between weight status and waist circumference, blood pressure, biomarkers, diet, physical activity, sedentary behaviors, and psychosocial factors was assessed. Results: About 78.1% of employees were overweight/obese. Obese participants (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 30.0 kg/m²) had higher consumption of potatoes, fats, sugary beverages, and spent more time watching television, playing computer games, and sitting than those having normal weight. Being obese was positively associated with blood pressure, blood glucose, low-density lipoprotein, and negatively associated with high-density lipoprotein. Finally, 78.8% of workers were dissatisfied with their worksite wellness with dissatisfaction being higher among obese employees. Being overweight (BMI 25.0 to 29.9 kg/m²) was positively associated with blood pressure, but not other variables. Conclusion: Understanding the risk profile of hospital workers is critical to developing effective interventions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this article was to investigate the short-term effects of violent video games and prosocial video games on cognition, emotion and behavior based on the perspective of general learning model. Methods: A sample of 80 undergraduate students took part in a 2(Video game content: violent video game and prosocial video game)x 2 (Trait aggressiveness: high aggressiveness and low agressiveness) experiment. Participants were asked to complete a tan-gram puzzle task used to assess helpful behavior and aggressive behavior. State Hostility Scale, Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire and Chinese Hostility Inventory were used to assess aggressive affect, prosocial affect, trait aggressiveness and aggressive cognition. Results: The group with prosocial video games experience showed increased positive state affect, compared to the group with violent video games. The group with violent video games reported more aggressive cognition, affect and behavior than the group with prosocial video games. Moreover, in the violent video game condition, participants with high aggressiveness showed more aggressive affect and cognition than those with low aggressiveness. Conclusion: The present study partially supports the general learning model. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Sexual arousal has emerged as an important contextual feature in sexual encounters that can impact safer-sex decision-making. We conducted two experiments that investigated the effects of sexual arousal among male and female participants. Experiment 1 (N = 144) examined the impact of sexual around on sexual health decision-making. Sexually explicit and neutral video clips as well as hypothetical romantic scenarios were used to evaluate the effects of sexual arousal on sexual risk-taking intentions. Men and women who reported higher levels of sexual arousal also displayed greater intentions to participate in risky sexual behavior (e.g., unprotected sex with a new sex partner). Experiment 2 (N = 122) examined the impact of sexual arousal on general risk-taking, using the same videos clips as in Experiment 1 and a modified version of a computerized Blackjack card game. Participants were offered a chance to make either a risky play or a safe play during ambiguous conditions. Increased sexual arousal in Experiment 2 was associated with impulsivity and a greater willingness to make risky plays in the Blackjack game. These findings suggest that, in situations where there are strong sexually visceral cues, both men and women experiencing strong sexual arousal may have lower inhibitions and may experience impaired decision-making. This phenomenon may have an impact during sexual encounters and may contribute to a failure to use appropriate prophylactic protection. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The study aimed to elucidate the influence of cognitive engagement comprised in an acute bout of exergame-based physical activity on executive functions (inhibition, cognitive flexibility) in adolescents. Therefore, the level of cognitive engagement and the intensity of physical activity were systematically varied across three experimental conditions. Sixty-five healthy male adolescents (13 ± 16 years) were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (a) physical activity with high levels of cognitive engagement during active video gaming, (b) physical activity with low levels of cognitive engagement during active video gaming, (c) sedentary with low levels of cognitive engagement during passive video watching. Manipulation checks, including subjective and objective operationalizations of cognitive engagement, were applied. Executive functions were assessed before and after each condition using the D-KEFS design fluency test. Results showed that cognitive engagement, operationalized by subjects' ratings and heart rate variability, differed between conditions. The physical activity condition with a high level of cognitive engagement resulted in significantly better performance in cognitive flexibility compared to conditions with low levels of cognitive engagement. Regarding benefits for executive functions in male adolescents, the results indicate that acute physical activity with high cognitive engagement could be more efficient than physical activity of the same intensity with low cognitive engagement. Even though further evidence is needed, these results extend previous research and suggest a methodological approach for measuring cognitive engagement.

AB  - Mood repair is a well-established function of media usage implying distraction from negative mood and the modification of unpleasant arousal states. Recent studies have found interactive media, in particular computer games, to be more effective in repairing mood than noninteractive media. It has been suggested that this is due to the higher task demand of interactive media distracting the players from negative feelings. Yet interactive media have also been found to increase arousal, which can also be seen as a cause for successful mood repair. It remains an open question which mechanism or to which degree both mechanisms—distraction and arousal regulation—account for mood repair via interactive media. The current study was designed to examine this so far unanswered question. We analyzed how effectively negative moods were regulated after a computer game, after a gameplay video, and without media consumption (control group). Mood repair, physiological arousal (positive change in electrodermal activity), and subjective arousal were assessed. Results confirmed that computer games led to a higher degree of mood repair and that this repair was a function of task demand as well as arousal characteristics. Results are discussed in terms of arousal regulation and intervention potential in interactive media. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Past research on consequences of video game play have conflated two distinct psychological mechanisms, habituation and generalization, into a unified process dubbed 'desensitization.' The current paper reports the results of two studies, a repeated exposure study and a single exposure study, which examine habituation and generalization of biophysiological and self-reported arousal responses to violent video games. The findings indicate that repeated play leads to habituation in both biophysiological and self-report responses. Notably, evidence of generalization is more apparent in the biophysiological data. The results are discussed in terms of: (1) implications for game developers and players, (2) implications for game researchers, (3) current conceptual ambiguity between cross-sectional and longitudinal models, and (4) the appropriateness of utilizing self-report measures in longitudinal studies examining arousal.

AB  - Rugby union is a physically intense intermittent sport coupled with high force collisions. Each position within a team has specific requirements which are typically based on speed, size and skill. The aim of this study was to investigate the contemporary demands of each position and whether they can explain changes in psychophysiological stress. Urine and saliva samples were collected before and after five selected Super 15 rugby games from 37 players. Total neopterin (NP), cortisol and immunoglobulin A were analysed by SCX-high performance liquid chromatography and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Global positioning system software provided distance data, while live video analysis provided impact data. All contemporary demands were analysed as events per minute of game time. Forwards were involved in more total impacts, tackles and rucks compared to backs (p < 0.001), while backs were involved in more ball carries and covered more total distance and distance at high speed per minute of game time (p < 0.01). Loose forwards, inside and outside backs covered significantly more distance at high speed (p < 0.01), while there was a negligible difference with number of impacts between the forward positions. There was also minimal difference between positions in the percentage change in NP, cortisol and sIgA. The results indicate distance covered and number of impacts per minute of game time is position-dependent whereas changes in psychophysiological stress are independent. This information can be used to adapt training and recovery interventions to better prepare each position based on the physical requirements of the game.

AB  - Past research on video game effects was often limited to explaining effects of game content and mode, leaving structural and contextual game elements scarcely investigated. The present research examined the yet unclear role of narration in video games, by adapting concepts and methodology from video game research based on self-determination theory as well as past research on the effects of literary fiction. Results provided evidence for the facilitation of immersion and an immersion-mediated enhancement of autonomy and relatedness need satisfaction through in-game storytelling, suggesting a mutual enhancement of immersion and need satisfaction. Moreover, in-game storytelling enhanced affective theory of mind. Perspectives on future research, connecting in-game storytelling and game content to complement current knowledge of video game effects on various real-world outcomes, are discussed.

AB  - Presence in virtual reality—the feeling that one is inside mediated reality—has fascinated academics in the field of virtual reality from its onset. While conceptual analyses and empirical research unequivocally stressed the importance of immersion through sensory input, agent-related aspects such as mental beliefs received less attention. We are the first to examine the separate and combined effects of being exposed to the smell of a particular stimulus and/or having a representation of this stimulus in mind. Blood was considered to be interesting to work with, because of widespread folk ideas about its capacity to induce aggression in violent contexts. Using a violent computer game in a between-subjects design, male subjects were tested for the immersive impact of blood, first as an olfactory cue, and second as a mental belief, i.e. the true or false belief that one is smelling ‘blood’. Lower skin conductance and game scores showed that ‘blood’ served as a distractor hindering the subject’s spontaneous engagement. Subjects higher in dispositional aggressiveness, however, got more immersed during the ‘blood’ game rounds, by displaying more combativeness. We discuss our results in light of the undervalued importance of subjective realism in research on presence, and explain the relevance of this work for applications in virtual training in the military and for clinical intervention in combat-related PTSD.

AB  - Prior research has shown that in the context of competition, larger rewards are associated with amplified physiological arousal. Yet, few studies examined the effect of reward on testosterone (T) level, although this hormone has been shown to respond to competitive situations and status shifts. The present study investigated salivary T level, physiological arousal (heart rate and heart rate variability), changes during competition in young males (N = 40, mean age = 21.7 ± 2.3 years). Participants competed in pairs in a video game, whereby they could win or lose—according to skill and effort. According to random grouping, pairs were either rewarded equally or the winner gained more monetary reward than the loser (unequal reward). Apart from the physiological and endocrine assessments, questionnaires provided information about competitive attitudes (hypercompetitiveness, and 'personal development competitive attitude') and mood changes through the competition. Results yielded that both conditions increased subjective and cardiac arousal, but reward conditions had not influenced T response; T increased only in hypercompetitive losers. Competitive performance was correlated to T level and T level change in both winners and losers, supporting the observation that competitive performance and T level can be in a reciprocal relationship. These findings are consistent with the status instability hypothesis. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In a shooting video game we investigated whether increased distance reduces moral conflict. We measured and analyzed the event related potential (ERP), including the N2 component, which has previously been linked to cognitive conflict from competing decision tendencies. In a modified Go/No-go task designed to trigger moral conflict participants had to shoot suddenly appearing human like avatars in a virtual reality scene. The scene was seen either from an ego perspective with targets appearing directly in front of the participant or from a bird’s view, where targets were seen from above and more distant. To control for low level visual features, we added a visually identical control condition, where the instruction to 'shoot' was replaced by an instruction to 'detect.' ERP waveforms showed differences between the two tasks as early as in the N1 time-range, with higher N1 amplitudes for the close perspective in the 'shoot' task. Additionally, we found that pre-stimulus alpha power was significantly decreased in the ego, compared to the bird’s view only for the 'shoot' but not for the 'detect' task. In the N2 time window, we observed main amplitude effects for response (No-go > Go) and distance (ego > bird perspective) but no interaction with task type (shoot vs. detect). We argue that the pre-stimulus and N1 effects can be explained by reduced attention and arousal in the distance condition when people are instructed to 'shoot.' These results indicate a reduced moral engagement for increased distance. The lack of interaction in the N2 across tasks suggests that at that time point response execution dominates. We discuss potential implications for real life shooting situations, especially considering recent developments in drone shootings which are per definition of a distant view.

AB  - Introduction: The study was carried out with children of 2nd, 4th and 6th grades of elementary school in order to explore what and how will children learn from a completely new videogame. Method: We organized children from 2nd, 4th and 6th grades of elemental school , giving them chance to play a freshly released videogame by that time. We formed small groups of 4 players with 2 boys and 2 girls in each group. We offered them a console and only 2 controllers. With this design, we would like to observe and analyze the differences between these players according to their age and gender. This process of learning and playing videogames lasted for 11 weeks. Result: The results have shown the capacity of learning without adult’s intervention among all the players in this study. It also shows the coordination of cooperation of each group in order to learn to play the video game. We’d like to highlight their autonomy in learning and their ability to solve different conflicts happened during the process in their group, from the beginning and during the play time, their way of regulate each player’s play time and also their capacity of create meanings in the game’s virtual world, characters or concrete actions. Discussion: Complex and important capacities were displayed during the learnig process by the children: leadership, caring for other players, control of the process, etc. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: The influence of violent video games on behavior is the subject of heated debate based on conflicting scientific data. Since the arrival of increasingly violent video games, and the media coverage attracted by several mass killings such as those of Columbine, Virginia Tech, Utoya, or Aurora, an emotional debate has developed, concerning the impact of video games on aggressiveness, violence or even criminality. Several recent meta-analyses have contributed contradictory findings. Whereas, with respect to the use of video games, some studies conclude that there has been an increase in aggressiveness in the short and long term, others have revealed a decrease in criminality. The findings of previous studies are overwhelmingly in favor of a negative influence on aggressiveness. However, data on the impact of this type of media on criminal behavior is lacking. Objective: This work aims to bring new arguments to corroborate or invalidate the assumption that the use of violent video games is a criminogenic risk factor. Method: We conducted a case-control study, comparing the use of violent video games in a sample of 83 subjects under investigation, versus a sample from the general population. After characterizing their consumption patterns of video games, we looked for an association between the criminal act and exposure to violent video games. Univariate and multivariate analysis were conducted. Results: The proportion of players in subjects under investigation, including consumers of violent video games, was lower than that observed in control subjects. In addition, we did not find any significant difference between the consumption patterns of violent video games in criminal population or in control population. Finally, the estimated relative risk of criminal enactment associated with the use of video games was not significant. With multivariate analysis, taking into account the association of already known criminogenic risk factors, we did not find a significant excess risk associated with the use of violent video games. Discussion: Our results are consistent with the current literature. Until then, many studies suggest that, despite an increase in aggressiveness, violence in video games could be the cause of a reduction in criminality. The concerns about the effects of violent video games on aggressive thought patterns, emotions, and behavior are justified. But until now, no study has been able to show that exposure to violent digital games are associated with an increase in criminality, aggressiveness, or violent behavior. Nevertheless, these paradoxical results are not incompatible. There is indeed a tremendous difference between aggressiveness and hetero-aggressive outburst. It is likely that the answer lies in the complexity of the concept of committing an act. Exposure to violent video games could be one factor, among many others, in a constellation of parameters leading an individual to commit an aggressive act. The research on this hot topic is still inconsistent and thus, psychiatrist may wish to be more careful in their public statements linking violent digital games to harm. Psychiatrists, medical professionals and researchers would risk damaging our credibility by exaggerating video game violence effects. There is indeed a lack of scientific data dealing with the relationship between violent video games and this interaction between the individual's mental state and aggressive outcome. Conclusion: The results of our study are not in favor of the accountability of violent video games on the criminal act. Our conclusion leans to not consider their use as a criminogenic risk factor. The results are discussed in light of current literature. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - We examined how a friend's presence affects a performer's prefrontal activation in daily‐life activities using two wireless portable near‐infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) devices. Participants played a driving video game either solely in the single group or with a friend in the paired group. The two groups (single and paired) were subdivided according to their game proficiency (low and high). The NIRS data demonstrated a significant interaction of group by proficiency. Low‐proficiency players in the paired group showed lower activation than those in the single group, but high‐proficiency players did not. In the paired group, high‐proficiency players showed higher activation than low‐proficiency players, but not in the single group. These results suggest that NIRS detects social presence effects in everyday situations: decreasing prefrontal activation in low‐proficiency performers due to tension reduction and increasing prefrontal activation in high‐proficiency performers due to increased arousal.

AB  - This paper concerns how intelligent systems should be designed to make adequate, valuable and natural affective interventions. The article proposes a process for choosing an affective intervention model for an intelligent system. The process consists of 10 activities that allow for step-by-step design of an affective feedback loop and takes into account the following factors: expected and desired emotional states, characteristics of the system and available input channels for emotion recognition. The proposed method is supported with three examples of intelligent systems that have used the process to design or to describe affective intervention. Two of them are case studies of affective video games that were designed with the proposed approach and evaluated against the non-affective versions. Another example described in the article is the affective tutoring system Gerda, which exemplifies a more complex and sophisticated intervention model.

AB  - Guilt and envy play an important role in social interaction. Guilt occurs when individuals cause harm to others or break social norms. Envy occurs when individuals compare themselves unfavorably to others and desire to benefit from the others’ advantage. In both cases, these emotions motivate people to act and change the status quo: following guilt, people try to make amends for the perceived transgression, and following envy, people try to harm envied others. In this article, we present two experiments that study participants’ experience of guilt and envy when engaging in social decision making with machines and humans. The results showed that, though experiencing the same level of envy, people felt considerably less guilt with machines than with humans. These effects occurred both with subjective and behavioral measures of guilt and envy, and in three different economic games: public goods, ultimatum, and dictator game. This poses an important challenge for human-computer interaction because, as shown here, it leads people to systematically exploit machines, when compared to humans. We discuss theoretical and practical implications for the design of human-machine interaction systems that hope to achieve the kind of efficiency—cooperation, fairness, reciprocity, etc.—we see in human-human interaction.

AB  - Objective: To investigate whether the latent neural correlates of incentive processing differ between problem gamblers (PGs) and healthy controls (HCs). Methods: Event-related potential (ERP) data were derived while 16 PGs and 20 HCs played a computer electronic gaming machine (EGM) task. Psychophysiological responses to outcomes commonly encountered during EGM gambling, including Large wins, Small wins, Near-wins, and Losses, were examined using a spatiotemporal principal components analysis (PCA). Subjects also completed questionnaires that assessed their levels of impulsivity, attraction to appetitive stimuli, and avoidance of aversive stimuli. Results: Losses elicited a feedback-related negativity (FRN), whereas wins elicited a feedback-related positivity (FRP) at the same latency and topography. PGs exhibited both attenuated FRN amplitudes following Losses and FRP amplitudes following Wins. Greater P3b amplitudes were found following Wins compared to Losses. FRN amplitudes following Near-wins were significantly reduced compared to Losses for both PGs and HCs. Trends for reduced P3b amplitudes following all outcome types, and for similar P3b amplitudes following Large and Small wins, were found for the PG group. Conclusions: We provide evidence that PGs are hyposensitive to both positive and negative outcomes. Significance: The finding that PGs are hyposensitive to reward and punishment provides valuable insight into the nature of deficit in this disorder, and provides a foundation for future research and clinical interventions.

AB  - Evaluations of objects change as a function of our experience with them. We suggest that this also applies to the evaluation of emotions. In three studies, we show that the evaluation of anger changes as a function of direct experience with anger. We found that the experience of anger in a context in which it could be beneficial (i.e., an aggressive computer game) led people to perceive anger as more useful (Study 1). Moreover, people came to evaluate anger less negatively after experiencing anger in a context in which it could be beneficial. These changes did not result from the mere experience of anger or from exposure to an aggressive context (Study 2). Rather, the more anger improved their performance, the less negatively participants came to evaluate anger (Study 3). These findings suggest that how bad anger seems may depend on our direct experience with it. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Most literature on the relationship between video gaming and sleep disturbances has looked at children and adolescents. There is little research on such a relationship in adult samples. The aim of the current study was to investigate the association of video game volume with sleep quality in adults via face‐to‐face interviews using standardized questionnaires. Adults (n = 844, 56.2% women), aged 18–94 years old, participated in the study. Sleep quality was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and gaming volume was assessed by asking the hours of gaming on a regular weekday (Mon–Thurs), Friday and weekend day (Sat–Sun). Adjusting for gender, age, educational level, exercise and perceived stress, results of hierarchical regression analyses indicated that video gaming volume was a significant predictor of sleep quality (β = 0.145), fatigue (β = 0.109), insomnia (β = 0.120), bedtime (β = 0.100) and rise time (β = 0.168). Each additional hour of video gaming per day delayed bedtime by 6.9 min (95% confidence interval 2.0–11.9 min) and rise time by 13.8 min (95% confidence interval 7.8–19.7 min). Attributable risk for having poor sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index > 5) due to gaming > 1 h day was 30%. When examining the components of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index using multinomial regression analysis (odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals), gaming volume significantly predicted sleep latency, sleep efficiency and use of sleep medication. In general, findings support the conclusion that gaming volume is negatively related to the overall sleep quality of adults, which might be due to underlying mechanisms of screen exposure and arousal.

AB  - This study examined physiological and affective responses of an interactive video game (IVG) across user experience and social conditions. College-age volunteers (N=48) were randomly assigned to experienced (n~24) or inexperienced (n=24) groups. Experienced group participants acquired two hours of game play prior to experimental trials. Participants completed 30 min of game play in two social conditions (solo and paired) on separate days. Heart rate (HR), step count, and perceived exertion (RPE) were examined during experimental trials and mood (Profile of Mood States) was assessed at 5 min pre-, 5 min post-, and 15 min post-session. Mean HR and RPE were 103 2 ± 21 bpm vs 94.7 ± 21 bpm (p = .06) and 2 8 ± 1.2 vs. 2.4 ± 1.2 (p = 14) in the inexperienced and experienced groups respectively. Peak HR was significantly higher in the paired condition (p=.03). Results indicated < 1% of game play exceeded ACSM recommended target HR. Change in mood scores representing the experience by time interaction were (TMD change) 3.5 ± 12.56 at 5-min post and 4.5 ± 13.07 at 15-min post in the inexperienced group vs. - 60 ± 11.16 at 5-min post and 3.75 ± 9.66 at 15 min post in the experienced group (p=.06). The IVG provided only a minimal physiological stimulus, resulting from limited total body movements during play. Physiological and affective responses were not influenced by experience or social condition. Careful consideration needs to be given when implementing interactive video gaming as a potential alternative to traditional physical activity.

AB  - Background: The objective of this study was to estimate the mean difference in energy expenditure (EE) in healthy adults between playing active video games (AVGs) compared with traditional video games (TVGs) or rest. Methods: A systematic search was conducted on Ovid MEDLINE, Web of Knowledge, and Academic Search Premier between 1998 and April 2012 for relevant keywords, yielding 15 studies, EE and heart rate (HR) data were extracted, and random effects meta-analysis was performed. Results: EE during AVG play was 1.81 (95% CI, 1.29-2.34; I² = 94.2%) kcal/kg/hr higher, or about 108 kcal higher per hour for a 60-kg person, compared with TVG play Mean HR was 21 (95% CI, 13.7-28.3; I² = 93.4%) beats higher per minute during AVG play compared with TVG play. There was wide variation in the EE and HR estimates across studies because different games were evaluated. Overall metabolic equivalent associated with AVG play was 2.62 (95% CI, 2.25-3.00; I² = 99.2%), equivalent to a light activity level. Most studies had low risk of bias due to proper study design and use of indirect calorimetry to measure EE. Conclusion: AVGs may be used to replace .sedentary screen time (eg, television watching or TVG play) with light activity in healthy adults.

AB  - Background: Anxiety produced by environmental threats can impair goal-directed processing and is associated with a range of psychiatric disorders, particularly when aversive events occur unpredictably. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is thought to implement controls that minimize performance disruptions from threat-induced anxiety and goal distraction by modulating activity in regions involved in threat detection, such as the amygdala. The inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and ventromedial PFC (vmPFC) have been linked to the regulation of anxiety during threat exposure. We developed a paradigm to determine if threat-induced anxiety would enhance functional connectivity between the amygdala and IFG, OFC, and vmPFC. Methods: Healthy adults performed a computer-gaming style task involving capturing prey and evading predators to optimize monetary rewards while exposed to the threat of unpredictable shock. Psychophysiological recording (n = 26) and functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning (n = 17) were collected during the task in separate cohorts. Task-specific changes in functional connectivity with the amygdala were examined using psychophysiological interaction analysis. Results: Threat exposure resulted in greater arousal measured by increased skin conductance but did not influence performance (i.e., monetary losses or rewards). Greater functional connectivity between the right amygdala and bilateral IFG, OFC, vmPFC, anterior cingulate cortex, and frontopolar cortex was associated with threat exposure. Conclusions: Exposure to unpredictable threat modulates amygdala-PFC functional connectivity that may help maintain performance when experiencing anxiety induced by threat. Our paradigm is well-suited to explore the neural underpinnings of the anxiety response to unpredictable threat in patients with various anxiety disorders.

AB  - Memory of a traumatic event becomes consolidated within hours. Intrusive memories can then flash back repeatedly into the mind’s eye and cause distress. We investigated whether reconsolidation—the process during which memories become malleable when recalled—can be blocked using a cognitive task and whether such an approach can reduce these unbidden intrusions. We predicted that reconsolidation of a reactivated visual memory of experimental trauma could be disrupted by engaging in a visuospatial task that would compete for visual working memory resources. We showed that intrusive memories were virtually abolished by playing the computer game Tetris following a memory-reactivation task 24 hr after initial exposure to experimental trauma. Furthermore, both memory reactivation and playing Tetris were required to reduce subsequent intrusions (Experiment 2), consistent with reconsolidation-update mechanisms. A simple, noninvasive cognitive-task procedure administered after emotional memory has already consolidated (i.e., > 24 hours after exposure to experimental trauma) may prevent the recurrence of intrusive memories of those emotional events.

AB  - According to a social cognitive theory, children may learn to function through processes of modeling and observational learning, with parents and the media being the significant sources of socialization and learning in the home environment. Adolescence is a period when children progressively look for autonomy and independence. One of the important research questions is whether adolescents utilize screen-based media with or without parental monitoring and limit-setting. This exploratory study examines socio-demographic factors associated with parenting (i.e., co-using, limit setting on the amount, limit setting on contents, and active mediation) in regards to television and video game usage during adolescence. Participants were 799 adolescents (5th to 12th graders) and their parents. Results indicate no gender differences in parental monitoring, but age/grade differences were found with less parental monitoring (more autonomy or independence) of older children. Parental monitoring also differed by ethnicity and by household income. Asian parents were the most restrictive while Hispanic parents were the least restrictive. Parents also reported more active mediation or engagement in families with higher household income. Findings initiate consideration of parenting styles in adolescent media usage, which have implications for adolescent adjustment and developmental outcomes.

AB  - Purpose: Technology-related behaviors (e.g., computer use) before bedtime (BT) have been associated with poorer and shorter sleep in adolescents; however, less is known about other behaviors in relation to sleep. This study characterized a range of behaviors in the hour before bed (i.e., pre-BT behaviors [PBBs]) and examined their relationship with sleep parameters during school and vacation periods (i.e., restricted and extended sleep opportunities, respectively). Mechanistic roles of chronotype and cognitive presleep arousal (PSAcog) were also examined. Methods: During the last week of a school term and throughout a 2-week vacation, 146 adolescents (47.26% male, age M ± standard deviation = 16.2 ± 1.0 years) from the general community completed daily sleep measure using actigraphy, self-report measures on PBBs and PSAcog (Presleep Arousal Scale) for both school and vacation periods, and chronotype (Morningness–Eveningness Questionnaire). Results: Adolescents engaged in a variety of behaviors before bed. Notably, playing video games was associated with significantly later school and vacation BT and shorter school sleep duration (controlling for chronotype). During vacation, online social media was associated with significantly longer sleep onset latency, and this relationship was mediated by higher PSAcog. In contrast, on school nights, spending time with family was associated with significantly earlier BT and longer sleep duration. Conclusions: Technology-related PBBs video games and online social media were risk factors for shorter and poorer sleep, whereas time with family was protective of sleep duration. In addressing sleep problems in adolescents, therapeutic procedures that target the potentially addictive nature of technology use and reduce PSAcog were implicated.

AB  - Just as books and films about traumatic events have become part of Western popular culture, so the theme of trauma and its accompanying tropes have been seeping into video games over the last two decades. In spite of the discernible trauma trend within video games, however, and the potential they exhibit for representing trauma in new ways, they have received very little critical notice from trauma theorists. In this article, we argue that a trauma-theoretical study of games has much to offer our understanding of the ways that trauma can be represented, in addition to giving game studies scholars further insight into how games manage to elicit such strong emotions and difficult ethical quandaries in players. We demonstrate this by performing a close reading of one recent and much-discussed game, The Walking Dead: Season One, analyzing how it incorporates psychological trauma in terms of inter(re)activity, empathy, and complicity.

AB  - Background: The ability of interactive video games (IVGs) to individualize physical demands influences their viability as a physical activity option. This study examined the influence of experience level on activity levels and affect resulting from playing a martial arts IVG. Methods: Twenty participants completed 3 15-minute trials: (1) walking, (2) IVG with no previous experience (INEXP), and (3) IVG activity after 2 hours of practice (EXP) during which heart rate (HR), step counts, metabolic equivalents of task (METs), ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), session RPE, and affect (positive/negative affect, enjoyment) were measured. Results: Mean HR was lower during walking (107 ± 18 bpm) than during INEXP (131 ± 25 bpm) and EXP (120 ± 20 bpm). Peak HR and session RPE were lower for walking than for INEXP and EXP No difference in mean HR was observed between IVG conditions, but peak HR and session RPE were lower for EXP than for INEXP. Walking resulted in greater postactivity reduction of negative affect; however, the IVG conditions were perceived as more enjoyable. Conclusions: Although the current IVG provided a greater exercise stimulus than walking, results suggest that user movements become more efficient with greater IVG experience and that exercise outcomes may decrease as a result.

AB  - The purpose of this research was to find out the impact of the physiological and technical aspects of three different situations of small-sided games (SSG) on young football players. The different situations considered were 3 vs 3, 4 vs 4 and 5 vs 5 in a space of 30 x 30 m, implemented by 10 young male football players (age 9.3 ± 0.7; height 138.5 ± 10.5 cm, weight 41.9 ± 6 kg and 2.2 ± 1.4 years' experience). The technical actions were quantified out of video recordings and the physiological performance of the exercise was measured through the heart rate (%HRmed and %HRpico), and the rated of perceived exertion (RPE). The results of variance analysis (ANOVA) show significant differences in the following variables: good passes, bad passes, average HR, maximum HR; time 70-79% and between > 90%HRmáx and PSE. The results point out that the manipulation of the density of the tasks has effects on different levels and must therefore be taken into account by the coaches that work with young players when it comes to designing training tasks. The main conclusion is that the use of the 3 vs 3 format seems more demanding both for technical purposes and aerobic performance. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In computerized technology, artificial speech is becoming increasingly important, and is already used in ATMs, online gaming and healthcare contexts. However, today’s artificial speech typically sounds monotonous, a main reason for this being the lack of meaningful prosody. One particularly important function of prosody is to convey different emotions. This is because successful encoding and decoding of emotions is vital for effective social cognition, which is increasingly recognized in human–computer interaction contexts. Current attempts to artificially synthesize emotional prosody are much improved relative to early attempts, but there remains much work to be done due to methodological problems, lack of agreed acoustic correlates, and lack of theoretical grounding. If the addition of synthetic emotional prosody is not of sufficient quality, it may risk alienating users instead of enhancing their experience. So the value of embedding emotion cues in artificial speech may ultimately depend on the quality of the synthetic emotional prosody. However, early evidence on reactions to synthesized non-verbal cues in the facial modality bodes well. Attempts to implement the recognition of emotional prosody into artificial applications and interfaces have perhaps been met with greater success, but the ultimate test of synthetic emotional prosody will be to critically compare how people react to synthetic emotional prosody vs. natural emotional prosody, at the behavioral, socio-cognitive and neural levels.

AB  - Routines are some kind of patterned behaviors or strategies when solving the same problem repeatedly. This issue has gained wide concern in different fields of social science. Since 1994, this phenomenon has been studied experimentally by Cohen and Bacdayan (1994) using the task of Transform The Target (TTT). However, this task has not gained as much attention as Tower of Hanoi in problem solving because of its complexity and uncontrollability. Searching for appropriate experimental task of routines is necessary. The 'sum 10' game, which was developed by Novarese (2003) for group learning research is one of the appropriate. Based on the sum 10 game, the purpose of this research was to: (1) verify and depict the phenomenon of routines in three-person problem solving, and develop the index of routinization; (2) investigate the effect of different cooperation levels on routinization. According to the requirements of the study purpose, two electronic programs were developed based on a software development technology called LAMP, which is the combination of software Linux, Apache, Mysql and PHP for building network platform. In Experiment 1, 93 undergraduates were randomly assigned into 31 groups to complete 28 rounds of the sum 10 game cooperatively. After the experiment, we interviewed all these 93 participants to learn about the process of the cooperation in the sum 10 game among the three group members. In Experiment 2, 96 undergraduates were randomly assigned to three treatment levels: full cooperation, conditional cooperation and noncooperation levels. Participants completed 28 round of the sum 10 game with two fake participants in three game rooms on the internet platform. Computer automatically recorded all performance of the participants in two experiments. The results of Experiment 1 showed that the phenomenon of routines existed obviously in the sum 10 game. Routines were confirmed and measured by two methods. Firstly, it can be confirmed and described by the following 7 indexes in three categories (behavior, cognition and emotion): increasing reliability, increasing speed, repeated action sequences, occasional suboptimality, patterned behaviors based on defined strategy, satisfaction and expectation. Secondly, routines were verified according to whether a number has been chosen more than 10 times at the individual level or whether a strategy has been chosen more than 11 times at the group level. Correspondingly, routinization could also be depicted at the individual and group level. The results of Experiment 2 showed that there were significant differences of the routinization under three different cooperation levels. The degree of routinization was the highest under the noncooperation condition, whereas it was the lowest under the full cooperation condition. Combined with previous research results, the present study constructed a new index system for routines and routinization, which could be applied to future studies. The effect of cooperation levels on routinzation indicated that routines have positive effects in problem solving, providing new ideas to investigate routine and routinization in such problem solving groups.

AB  - Context: Violence, experienced in either childhood or adulthood, has been associated with physical health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease. However, the consistency of the existing literature has not been evaluated. Evidence acquisition: In 2013, the authors conducted a PubMed and Web of Science review of peer-reviewed articles published prior to August 2013 on the relation between violence exposure, experienced in either childhood or adulthood, and cardiovascular outcomes. To meet inclusion criteria, articles had to present estimates for the relation between violence exposure and cardiovascular outcomes (e.g., hypertension, blood pressure, stroke, coronary disease, or myocardial infarction) adjusted for demographic factors. Articles focusing on violence from television, video games, natural disasters, terrorism, or war were excluded. Evidence synthesis: The initial search yielded 2,273 articles; after removing duplicates and applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 30 articles were selected for review. A consistent positive relation was noted on the association between violence experienced during childhood and cardiovascular outcomes in adulthood (i.e., hypertension, coronary heart disease, and myocardial infarction). Associations across genders with varying types of violence exposure were also noted. By contrast, findings were mixed on the relation between adult violence exposure and cardiovascular outcome. Conclusions: Despite varying definitions of violence exposure and cardiovascular endpoints, a consistent relation exists between childhood violence exposure, largely assessed retrospectively, and cardiovascular endpoints. Findings are mixed for the adult violence−cardiovascular health relation. The cross-sectional nature of most adult studies and the reliance of self-reported outcomes can potentially be attributed to the lack of findings among adult violence exposure studies.

AB  - Social decisions require evaluation of costs and benefits to oneself and others. Long associated with emotion and vigilance, the amygdala has recently been implicated in both decision-making and social behavior. The amygdala signals reward and punishment, as well as facial expressions and the gaze of others. Amygdala damage impairs social interactions, and the social neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) influences human social decisions, in part, by altering amygdala function. Here we show in monkeys playing a modified dictator game, in which one individual can donate or withhold rewards from another, that basolateral amygdala (BLA) neurons signaled social preferences both across trials and across days. BLA neurons mirrored the value of rewards delivered to self and others when monkeys were free to choose but not when the computer made choices for them. We also found that focal infusion of OT unilaterally into BLA weakly but significantly increased both the frequency of prosocial decisions and attention to recipients for context-specific prosocial decisions, endorsing the hypothesis that OT regulates social behavior, in part, via amygdala neuromodulation. Our findings demonstrate both neurophysiological and neuroendocrinological connections between primate amygdala and social decisions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Researchers have typically employed cognitive and affective measures to study the effectiveness of brand placements in video games. A psychophysiological approach to measuring effectiveness has been sorely lacking and is necessary to help both academics and practitioners further their understanding of how brand placements work. The current study measures individuals’ orienting responses in terms of increased skin conductance and decreased heart rate upon exposure to brands in video games. Results indicate that game players register background advertisements subconsciously even though they may not be able to explicitly recall them later. There were no differences between gamers and nongamers in the recall and recognition of brands from the video game. Furthermore, brands with preexisting favorable attitudes automatically received further processing, suggesting orienting response is an indicator of initial perception rather than further elaboration.

AB  - Background: Gambling disorder (GD) is characterized by a significant lack of self-control and is associated with impulsivity-related personality traits. It is also linked to deficits in emotional regulation and frequently co-occurs with anxiety and depression symptoms. There is also evidence that emotional dysregulation may play a mediatory role between GD and psychopathological symptomatology. Few studies have reported the outcomes of psychological interventions that specifically address these underlying processes. Objectives: To assess the utility of the Playmancer platform, a serious video game, as an additional therapy tool in a CBT intervention for GD, and to estimate pre-post changes in measures of impulsivity, anger expression and psychopathological symptomatology. Method: The sample comprised a single group of 16 male treatment-seeking individuals with severe GD diagnosis. Therapy intervention consisted of 16 group weekly CBT sessions and, concurrently, 10 additional weekly sessions of a serious video game. Pre-post treatment scores on South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS), Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11), I7 Impulsiveness Questionnaire (I7), State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory 2 (STAXI-2), Symptom Checklist-Revised (SCL-90-R), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S-T), and Novelty Seeking from the Temperament and Character Inventory-Revised (TCI-R) were compared. Results: After the intervention, significant changes were observed in several measures of impulsivity, anger expression and other psychopathological symptoms. Dropout and relapse rates during treatment were similar to those described in the literature for CBT. Conclusion: Complementing CBT interventions for GD with a specific therapy approach like a serious video game might be helpful in addressing certain underlying factors which are usually difficult to change, including impulsivity and anger expression.

AB  - Introduction: This study aimed to investigate changes in heart rate variability and cardiorespiratory coupling in male college students with problematic Internet use (PIU) excessive gaming type during action video game play to assess the relationship between PIU tendency and central autonomic regulation. Method: Electrocardiograms and respiration were simultaneously recorded from 22 male participants with excessive online gaming and 22 controls during action video game play. Sample entropy (SampEn) was computed to assess autonomic regularity, and cross-SampEn was calculated to quantify autonomic coordination. Results: During video game play, reduced cardiorespiratory coupling (CRC) was observed in individuals with PIU excessive gaming type compared with controls, implicating central autonomic dysregulation. The PIU tendency was associated with the severity of autonomic dysregulation. Conclusion: These findings indicate impaired CRC in PIU excessive gaming type, which may reflect alterations of central inhibitory control over autonomic responses to pleasurable online stimuli.

AB  - This study tested a model in which perceived parental media mediation in social network games (SNGs) was related to adolescents' conceptual and attitudinal advertising literacies, both of which were in turn related to purchase request intention. The 780 participants, aged between 10 and 14 years, watched a video clip of SNG Habbo that included a commercial message and then completed a questionnaire. Perceived autonomy-supportive restrictive media mediation was found to be positively associated with understanding selling intention. Perceived autonomy-supportive active media mediation was positively related to understanding persuasive intention. Understanding persuasive intention was positively related to purchase request intention. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Empathy is the ability to understand and feel for the emotions of others (Cohen & Strayer, 1996). In the context of media use research, the role of empathy has received comparatively less attention. However, empathy seems to develop differently in the media context and in direct communication (e. g., Leibetseder, Laireiter, & Köller, 2007). The current study proposes a new Media-Based Empathy (MBE) Scale covering present media use habits. Item and explorative factor analyses resulted in four subscales: media concern, affective media empathy, cognitive media empathy, and immersion in video games. In a youth (N = 273) and in an adult sample (N = 373), the same factorial structure and high reliabilities were found. Construct validity was confirmed via connections to traditional empathy, aggression, cyberbullying, and media use. As the subscale immersion in video games plays a specific role, interpretation on the subscale level is advised. The advances of MBE for media effects research are highlighted.

AB  - The article takes the form of a close examination of how children's imaginations were represented in Italian narratives during the 2000s. Written in a didactic, literary-criticism key and starting with two contemporary novels, Simona Vinci's A Game We Play (2000) and Giorgio Vasta's Time on My Hands (English edition out in 2017), the work highlights the 'difficulty of growing up' experienced by the books' preadolescent protagonists. The latter, united in strict, closed 'tribal' groups, enact games—genuine rites of passage—through which they seek to make their own the experiences, par excellence, of adult life: sex and violence. In assuming the protagonist children's perspective, the two narrative texts reveal not only the complex and tragic ways in which it is a submissive and subordinate imitation of models borrowed from the media (pornographic magazines and the television images of the Moro kidnapping, respectively) that prevail in the games but also the consequent desertification of emotions in contemporary instances of sentimental education.

AB  - Reports an error in 'Review of semantic-free utterances in social human–robot interaction' by Selma Yilmazyildiz, Robin Read, Tony Belpeame and Werner Verhelst (International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction, 2016[Jan], Vol 32[1], 63-85). The list of author names was incorrect in the original online and print publications. The correct list of author names for this article should appear as: Selma Yilmazyildiz, Robin Read, Tony Belpaeme, and Werner Verhelst. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2016-00562-006[/rid]). As a young and emerging field in social human–robot interaction (HRI), semantic-free utterances (SFUs) research has been receiving attention over the last decade. SFUs are an auditory interaction means for machines that allow emotion and intent expression, which are composed of vocalizations and sounds without semantic content or language dependence. Currently, SFUs are most commonly utilized in animation movies (e.g., R2-D2, WALL-E, Despicable Me), cartoons (e.g., 'Teletubbies,' 'Morph,' 'La Linea'), and computer games (e.g., The Sims) and hold significant potential for applications in HRI. SFUs are categorized under four general types: Gibberish Speech (GS), Non-Linguistic Utterances (NLUs), Musical Utterances (MU), and Paralinguistic Utterances (PU). By introducing the concept of SFUs and bringing multiple sets of studies in social HRI that have never been analyzed jointly before, this article addresses the need for a comprehensive study of the existing literature for SFUs. It outlines the current grand challenges, open questions, and provides guidelines for future researchers considering to utilize SFU in social HRI.

AB  - Flow is the subjective experience of effortless attention, reduced self-awareness, and enjoyment that typically occurs during optimal task performance. Previous studies have suggested that flow may be associated with a non-reciprocal coactivation of the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems and, on a cortical level, with a state of hypofrontality and implicit processing. Here, we test these hypotheses, using the computer game TETRIS as model task. The participants (n = 77) played TETRIS under three conditions that differed in difficulty (Easy < Optimal < Difficult). Cardiac and respiratory activities, and the average oxygenation changes of the prefrontal cortex were measured continuously with functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) during performance. The Optimal condition was characterized by the highest levels of state flow, positive affect, and effortless attention. The associations between self-reported psychological flow and physiological measures were investigated using a series of repeated measures linear mixed model analyses. The results showed that higher flow was associated with larger respiratory depth and lower LF. The higher respiratory depth during high flow is indicative of a more relaxed state with an increased parasympathetic activity, and thus provides partial support for the main hypotheses. There was no association between frontal cortical oxygenation and flow, even at liberal thresholds; i.e. we found no support that flow is related to a state of hypofrontality.

AB  - Background: This study examined the association of adolescent-reported family functioning and friendship quality with objectively-measured moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), sedentary time, and self-reported sedentary behaviours.Methods: Data are from the ROOTS study. MVPA and sedentary time were assessed using combined movement and heart rate sensing. Time spent TV viewing, using the internet, playing video games, doing homework and reading for pleasure was self-reported. Data on objectively-measured and self-reported outcomes for weekdays was available for 738 (age 14.5y, 55.7% female) and 800 (56.3% female) participants, respectively. Adolescents perceived family functioning and friendship quality (Two subscales: ‘Good friendship qualities’, ‘Friendship difficulties’) was assessed by questionnaire. Analyses were conducted using multi-level linear or logistic regression.Results: Adolescents reporting better family functioning accumulated more MVPA on weekdays (beta; 95% confidence interval: 0.57; 0.17,0.98). Higher scores on the good friendship qualities subscale was associated with greater MVPA throughout the week (weekdays: 1.13; 0.62,1.65, weekend: 0.56; 0.09,1.02) and lower sedentary time on weekdays (−10.34; −17.03,-3.66). Boys from better functioning families were less likely to report playing video games at the weekend (OR; 95% confidence interval: 0.73; 0.57,0.93) or reading for pleasure (weekday: 0.73; 0.56,0.96 weekend: 0.75; 0.58,0.96). Boys who attained higher scores on the good friendship qualities scale were less likely to play video games at the weekend (0.61; 0.44,0.86) or report high homework on weekdays (0.54; 0.31,0.94). A higher score for good friendship qualities was associated with lower odds of girls playing video games during the week (0.76; 0.58,1.00) or reading for pleasure at the weekend (0.61; 0.42,0.88). Girls that reported fewer friendship difficulties had lower odds of high TV viewing (0.76; 0.62,0.93) or playing video games (0.71; 0.52,0.97) at the weekend, and lower odds of reading for pleasure (0.63; 0.49,0.81) or reporting high homework on weekdays (0.70; 0.52,0.95).Discussion: Family functioning and friendship quality exhibit a complex pattern of association with physical activity and sedentary behaviour that varies by sex and day of the week. Findings highlight the potential value of targeting interpersonal aspects of the family and friendships as an adjunct to behaviour change interventions.

AB  - Affective computing seeks to create computational systems that adapt content and resources according to the affective states of the users. However, the detection of the user’s affection such as motivation and emotion is challenging especially when an attention problem is present. An approach to convey learning resources to children with learning problems is by means of game-based tools. The first step towards building these ludic experiences is to identify the skills and limitations of potential users. In this work we describe a case based study carried out to observe and get understanding of the level of attention, cognition and memory of children with ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder). Fifteen children were invited to play physical and digital versions of the Stroop and Flanker tests as well as memory-based games. The interaction with KAPEAN is allowed with both a mouse and a hand gestures recognition device. To collect data from the user’s experiences the system integrates a webcam, a Microsoft Kinect device, a video camera, and an Emotiv EEG headset. Data was analyzed offline in order to study which affective states are present while children with ADHD played with KAPEAN. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Purpose: Serious games have demonstrated positive effects on adolescent eating and physical activity. The purpose of this paper is to describe how constructs from social cognitive theory (SCT) and self-determination theory (SDT) were operationalized in the development of the serious game CREATURE 101 (C-101) to engage players in acquiring motivation, knowledge, skills, and personal agency. Approach: C-101 was developed from an evaluated nutrition and science curriculum for middle school youth, Choice, Control & Change (C3). Its behavior change goals are three pairs of 'increase/decrease' behaviors: increase water/decease sweetened beverages, increase fruit and vegetables/decrease processed snacks (chips, candy etc), and increase physical activity (light, medium, intense)/decrease recreational screen time (watching TV, playing video games for fun) through a 'virtual companion care' motif where the players bring their adopted creatures back to health. Several procedures or strategies were used to develop the story line and activities in C-101 to address autonomy, competence and relatedness from SDT and outcome expectations, self-efficacy, and behavioral capability from SCT, constructs shown in previous studies as likely to enhance effectiveness of nutrition and physical activity interventions. Implications: This description of how the theory constructs and procedures were used to create an entertaining serious game based on an existing evaluated health-related curriculum can help game developers, curriculum developers, and educators who wish to expand existing curricula through the development and integration of games into their work.

AB  - The aim of this research was to analyse the heart rate (HR), the perceived exertion (PE), and the technical-tactical demand in several small-sided games (SSGs) with standard goals and different defence schemes (no man-marking vs man-marking). Twelve football players whose age was 17.5 ± 0.8 years old performed 4 different kinds of SSGs (3 sets of 4 min): 3 vs. 3 and 6 vs. 6 with and without man-marking. The load of SSGs was quantified by HR and PE. In addition, each SSGs was video recorded with the aim to analyse technical-tactical performances. The PE was higher in man-marking (p < 0.05) compared to no man-marking in both 3 vs. 3 and 6 vs. 6 SSGs (7.0 ± 1.2 vs. 5.2 ± 1.2 y 5.4 ± 1.1 vs. 4.0 ± 0.7, (7.0 ± 1.2 vs. 5.2 ± 1.2 and 5.4 ± 1.1 vs. 4.0 ± 0.7, respectively). However, no differences were shown (p > 0.05) by HRmax for the very same SSGs (87.7 ± 3.7 vs. 87.1 ± 3.5%, 3 vs. 3; 85.0 ± 4.0 vs. 83.1 ± 5.0%, 6 vs. 6). Successful ball passing, the number of interventions and the control-passing actions were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the 6 vs. 6 no man-marking vs. man-marking. The results suggest that interchangeability between the HR and PE must be applied cautiously when assessing SSGs intensity/load. The defence used in SSGs influences the technical-tactical demands.

AB  - Healthy emotion regulation is crucial for navigating stressful situations. Interoceptive awareness—the awareness of one’s internal states—is important for such healthy regulation. Given the propensity for video games to induce stress, the associations between in-game and real world emotion regulation strategies during duress are worth exploring. We therefore present a method for measuring the interoceptive awareness of negative affect during stressful video game play, and investigate whether individual differences in this ability relate to emotion regulation strategies. Twenty-six proficient video game players were recruited to play a session of the video game Starcraft II in the lab. Players’ physiological and subjective states of in-game negative arousal were measured consecutively. A comparison of these measures was used to calculate players’ interoceptive awareness of real time in-game arousal. The relation between interoceptive awareness and a suite of emotion regulation strategies was then investigated. We observed a positive relation between in-game interoceptive awareness and the self-reported tendency to actively seek a resolution to negative affect. A positive trend was also observed between interoceptive awareness and the self-reported tendency to seek instrumental social support. Findings are discussed in terms of the relative effectiveness of different emotion regulation strategies for aiding in-game success. We further discuss the benefits and limitations of this pilot testing. In all, we hope to inspire future research into the associations between in-game arousal and emotion regulation strategies used in everyday life.

AB  - We investigated the relationship between stress (specifically, sympathetic tone) and effective and efficient cooperation between partners using a cooperative version of a Tetris game as a model of limited resources in a shared environment. Participants were recruited from 2 distinct sociocultural orientations: individualism (Americans) and collectivism (Japanese). We compared the frequency domain of heart rate variability (HRV) and average scores on the short form of the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (I-PANAS-SF) for individuals and dyad partners. Japanese players cooperated more effectively and their scores on the positive subscale of the I-PANAS-SF for both self and partner were higher than those of American players. However, Japanese participants experienced more stress, as indicated by an increased low-to-high HRV frequency ratio. Our results suggest that sociocultural orientation affects the motivation to promote prosocial interactions that result in efficiency and effectiveness of cooperation.

AB  - Innovation processes create distinctive challenges for coordination. Objects are seen as supporting coordination in such settings by enabling the emergent action needed to deal with a dynamic and uncertain process. Thus, previous work has highlighted the role of different types of objects in coordinating the collaborative tasks undertaken by expert groups, either by motivating the creation of new knowledge or through the translation of understanding. Through an empirical study of innovation processes in the computer games sector, our paper adds to this previous work by finding that the relations between objects, and not the objects alone, help to orchestrate multiple collaborative tasks towards a final outcome within temporal and resource constraints. The relational view which emerges from this study shows how such a ‘system of objects’ is able to stabilize coordination of the process while preserving the emergence and autonomy of games developer practices needed to achieve innovation.

AB  - Even though previous studies have addressed the relation between face-to-face bullying and cyberbullying, none have studied both phenomena simultaneously. In this article, we present a computer game-based method to study both types of peer aggression among youth. Study participants included fifth graders (N = 93) in two U.S. Midwestern middle schools. Students completed a self-report survey that included measures of aggression, bullying, emotions, and perceptions of school. Next, students were assigned to teams of four and completed both competitive and collaborative games. Results indicated significant correlations between survey measures and in-game interactions and showed that bistrategic players scored higher in relational aggression. These results contribute to the understanding of how face-to-face aggression relates to aggression in computer-mediated communication in middle-school students.

AB  - Although current emotion theories emphasize the importance of contextual factors for emotional expressive behavior, developmental studies that examine such factors are currently thin on the ground. In this research, we studied the course of emotional expressions of 8- and 11-year-old children after winning a (large) first prize or a (substantially smaller) consolation prize, while playing a game competing against the computer or a physically co-present peer. We analyzed their emotional reactions by conducting two perception tests in which participants rated children’s level of happiness. Results showed that co-presence positively affected children’s happiness only when receiving the first prize. Moreover, for children who were in the presence of a peer, we found that eye contact affected children’s expressions of happiness, but that the effect was different for different age groups: 8-year-old children were negatively affected, and 11-year-old children positively. Overall, we can conclude that as children grow older and their social awareness increases, the presence of a peer affects their non-verbal expressions, regardless of their appreciation of their prize.

AB  - Cognitive remediation has proven efficacy for improving neurocognition in people with schizophrenia. The current study evaluated the benefits of cognitive remediation on neurocognition, functioning, psychotic symptoms, and aggression in a sample of forensic and mental health patients. Care recipients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (N = 78) receiving services in the forensic and mental health units of a state hospital were randomized to participate in cognitive remediation versus computer games control activities. Participants' neurocognition, functional capacity, experiential recovery, psychotic symptoms, and aggression incidents were assessed at baseline and posttreatment. Cognitive remediation was associated with improvements in several neurocognitive domains and circumscribed domains of functional capacity. People assigned to cognitive remediation experiences greater reductions in negative symptoms, agitation/excitement, and verbal and physical aggression. In addition to improving neurocognition in long-term hospitalized forensic and mental health patients, cognitive remediation may enhance efforts at reducing negative symptoms, emotion dysregulation, and aggression incidents. Forensic settings may represent a new frontier for the clinical dissemination of cognitive remediation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Anxiety induction and elicitation of associated physiological arousal with virtual environments (VEs) is important in diverse domains. This paper evaluates three general anxiety induction techniques. The first augments the VE with a health bar that is often displayed in video games to indicate when the user’s avatar gets hurt. The second augments the VE with aversive audio-visual stimuli, which are employed in first-person shooter games when the user’s avatar gets hurt and include preset heartbeat sound. The third introduces in the previous technique a biofeedback mechanism to control heartbeat sound. The results we obtained on a VE that reproduces a fire evacuation indicate that the third technique produces much higher physiological arousal than the other two, and measures of users’ state anxiety are consistent with physiological results. We discuss possible reasons that could explain why the exploitation of auditory heartbeat biofeedback contributes to make the third technique more effective, by linking our study to research and theories of affect and emotions.

AB  - Aims: The aim of this study is to investigate associations of screen-time and physical activity (PA) with self-efficacy for PA, intrinsic motivation to PA and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in Colombian schoolchildren from socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods, and to compare these variables among children with normal-weight (NW), overweight (OW) and obesity (OB). Methods: In 678 schoolchildren (age 10–14 years) screen-time (TV, video games, computer) and number of days being physically active ≥ 60 minutes were self-reported. Multi-item scales were used to assess self-efficacy to PA and intrinsic motivation to PA. The KIDSCREEN-27 was used to assess HRQoL. Results: Screen-time was associated with HRQoL in the school/learning environment dimension. Number of days being physically active was associated with self-efficacy for PA, intrinsic motivation for PA and with HRQoL concerning physical well-being, autonomy/parent relation and social support/peers. Group differences were found for days being physically active (OW = 2.8 and OB = 2.7 vs. NW = 3.3) but not for screen-time (NW = 5.0, OW = 4.7 and OB = 5.7 hrs·d-1). OW and OB scored lower on intrinsic motivation to PA than NW (OW = 19.2 and OB = 17.9 versus NW = 20.1). All 3 groups differed in physical well-being scores (NW = 50.3, OW = 48.1, OB = 40.6, P < .001). Conclusions: Schoolchildren with overweight and obesity from socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods need additional motivational support to perform health-enhancing PA to experience higher physical well-being.

AB  - Increased food intake (FI) during television viewing has been reported in children, but it is unknown if this occurs following pre-meal video game playing (VGP). The objective was to determine the effect of pre-meal VGP for 30 min on subjective appetite and emotions, and FI in normal weight (NW) boys after a glucose or control preload. On four test mornings, NW boys (n = 19) received equally sweetened preloads of a non-caloric sucralose control or 50 g glucose in 250 mL of water, with or without VGP for 30 min. Food intake from an ad libitum pizza meal was measured immediately after. Subjective appetite was measured at 0, 15, 30, and 60 min. Subjective emotions were determined by visual analog scale at baseline and immediately before lunch. Both VGP (p = 0.023) and glucose (p < 0.001) suppressed FI. Pre-meal VGP compared with no-VGP, and glucose compared with the non-caloric control, decreased FI by 59 and 170 kcal, respectively. Subjective average appetite increased to 30 min (p = 0.003), but was lower after glucose (p = 0.01) in both the VGP and no-VGP conditions compared with the control. Frustration and aggression scores increased after VGP (p < 0.05), but did not correlate with FI. However, baseline and pre-meal happiness and excitement scores were inversely associated with FI. In conclusion, both pre-meal VGP and the glucose preload suppressed FI, supporting the roles of both physiologic and environmental factors in the regulation of short-term FI in 9- to 14-year-old NW boys.

AB  - Background: Alexithymia, the inability to describe one’s own emotions, is linked to deficits in empathy, manifesting as a diminished capacity to recognize or understand the emotions and mental states of others. Several brain centers of autonomic control and interoception that are activated in empathy are thought to misfunction in alexithymia. We hypothesized that individual differences in autonomic changes under affective stimulation might be associated with differences in alexithymia and empathy. Methods: We studied 21 healthy volunteers, comparing their alexithymia and empathy scores with changes in their sympathetic autonomic arousal, indexed by the palmar skin potential level, during 3 tasks: playing a computer game, performing mental arithmetic, and watching a negative emotional valence video. Results: Both autonomic and subjective sense of arousal increased at the beginning of each task and then gradually subsided over the course of the task. Higher autonomic arousal at the onset of the computer game was associated with higher empathy scores, and at the onset of the negative video with higher scores for both empathy and alexithymia. Alexithymia delayed the habituation of autonomic arousal during the computer game, while the empathy score was related to a faster decline in arousal during the negative video task. Conclusions: High alexithymia and high empathy scores were linked to increased autonomic arousal at the onset of emotional stimulation, but were distinguishable in the rates of habituation of the evoked arousal. Our data provide insight into the relationships among interacting psychological traits, physiologic regulation, and the arousal dimension of emotional experience.

AB  - This editorial presents overview of five research papers featured in the current issue of Journal of Advertising Research. The first article focuses on impact of different price-promotion types on sales and brand perception. It is a two part study, including both field research and data analysis, which showed that direct-price reduction had the strongest positive sales impact. The next article focuses on impact of information, emotion, and traceability on pass-along behavior. It dugs down into the data generated by nearly 20,000 global-brand-focused tweets compiled over a three-year period. The next article compares the effectiveness of comparative and non-comparative advertising. It examines a practice of presumed brand building that crosses both legacy and interactive media. The next article explores whether multiple new-product messages attract different consumer segments. It investigates whether video-game marketers should leverage different messages for different target segments for the same product. The next article focuses on the relationship between product placement and the performance of movies and determines how much audience pleasure (or displeasure) with on-screen brands may affect box-office revenues.

AB  - There has been a considerable transformation in game preferences of children with the rapid development of information and communication technology. Computer games became the mostly preferred spare time activity for children of different ages. Several studies found that technology, ranging from computer applications to social robots, can act as a mediator to improve interaction for children with social impairments. The contribution presented is an intermediate step which combines the embodiment with tangible and intuitive interaction that social robots can offer and an affordable and autonomous solution as a computer game. Probogotchi is a way to play an educational computer game, where children have to interact with a toy equipped with sensors connected to a PC. The control architecture is built around an artificial homeostatic system for social agents and is set to simulate pet-like behavior, resulting in a dependency on the user's interactions. As such, affective human-computer interaction is achieved. The homeostatic regulation is an autonomous system that uses input stimuli from a tactile and object identification system to detect certain actions originating from the user. If an action is triggered, it will influence the internal needs that are subsequently translated into an emotional state. This emotional state is communicated back to the user by a virtual model showing the corresponding facial expression. For the evaluation section, a preliminary study using Probogotchi as a bridge for interaction between a child with ASD and his typically developed sibling is for the first time described. Quantitative data and qualitative observations are presented. The paper concludes with a focus on the technical limitations and also on future developments and implications for the clinical use of Probogotchi game for children with autism.

AB  - Background and aims: Internet Gaming Disorder is included in the Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (5th edition) as a disorder that merits further research. The diagnostic criteria are based on those for Substance Use Disorder and Gambling Disorder. Excessive gamblers and persons with Substance Use Disorder show attentional biases towards stimuli related to their addictions. We investigated whether excessive Internet gamers show a similar attentional bias, by using two established experimental paradigms. Methods: We measured reaction times of excessive Internet gamers and non-gamers (N = 51, 23.7 ± 2.7 years) by using an addiction Stroop with computer-related and neutral words, as well as a visual probe with computer-related and neutral pictures. Mixed design analyses of variance with the between-subjects factor group (gamer/non-gamer) and the within-subjects factor stimulus type (computer-related/neutral) were calculated for the reaction times as well as for valence and familiarity ratings of the stimulus material. Results: In the addiction Stroop, an interaction for group × word type was found: Only gamers showed longer reaction times to computer-related words compared to neutral words, thus exhibiting an attentional bias. In the visual probe, no differences in reaction time between computer-related and neutral pictures were found in either group, but the gamers were faster overall. Conclusions: An attentional bias towards computer-related stimuli was found in excessive Internet gamers, by using an addiction Stroop but not by using a visual probe. A possible explanation for the discrepancy could lie in the fact that the visual probe may have been too easy for the gamers. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Purpose: This article considers the potential benefits that applying design principles from contemporary video games may have on enhancing therapy experiences. Method: Six principles of video game design are presented, and their relevance for enriching clinical experiences is discussed. Results: The motivational and learning benefits of each design principle have been discussed in the education literature as having positive impacts on student motivation and learning and are related here to aspects of clinical practice. The essential experience principle suggests connecting all aspects of the experience around a central emotion or cognitive connection. The discovery principle promotes indirect learning in focused environments. The risk-taking principle addresses the uncertainties clients face when attempting newly learned skills in novel situations. The generalization principle encourages multiple opportunities for skill transfer. The reward system principle directly relates to the scaffolding of frequent and varied feedback in treatment. Last, the identity principle can assist clients in using their newly learned communication skills to redefine self-perceptions. Conclusion: These principles highlight areas for research and interventions that may be used to reinforce or advance current practice. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the phenomenon of active escapism – a unique form of experiential consumption that engages fantasy and role-play as a means of coping. In contrast with passive forms of escapism, whereby consumers act as observers (e.g. watching a movie), active escapism provides consumers with the opportunity to directly interact with mediated realities, whether constructed in a virtual space (e.g. a video game) or the real world. Design/methodology/approach: Within the context of video game consumption, a conceptual framework for active escapism comprised antecedents, processes and consequences is established through literature review, depth interviews and naturalistic inquiry. Findings: The findings suggest that active escapism functions as a coping mechanism when consumers are confronted with external stressors that threaten either their sense of identity or control. While other forms of emotion-focused coping relieve stress through psychological avoidance (i.e. refocusing of attention away from stressors), active escapism provides the benefits of affirmation and empowerment through projective fantasy (i.e. role-play) and presence (i.e. immersion into a mediated reality). Originality/value: The conceptual framework established by this analysis gives insight into the structure of active escapism as a theoretical construct, providing a foundation for future research. Managerial implications for consumer escapism (e.g. branded in-game content) are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Off-the-shelf activity-promoting video games (AVGs) are proposed as a tool for promoting regular physical activity among individuals poststroke. Objective: To characterize the energy expenditure (EE), exercise intensity, and energy metabolism of individuals poststroke, while playing AVGs in different positions, from different consoles, and to compare the performance with comfortable walking and with able-bodied individuals. Methods: Eleven poststroke and 8 able-bodied participants played in standing Wii-Boxing Xbox-Boxing, Wii-Run and Penguin, and also Wii-Boxing in sitting. EE (expressed as metabolic equivalents [METs]); exercise intensity (expressed as %predicted maximal heart rate [HR]), rate of perceived exertion (RPE), and respiratory exchange ratio (RER) were used to characterize the games. Results: Participants’ poststroke EE ranged from 1.81 ± 0.74 to 3.46 ± 1.3 METs and was lower compared with able-bodied participants for Xbox-Boxing (P = .001), Wii-Boxing in standing (P = .01), Run (P < .001), and Penguin (P = .001). Participants’ poststroke exercise intensity ranged from 49.8 ± 9.3 to 64.7 ± 9.3 %predicted maximal HR and was lower compared with able-bodied participants for Xbox-Boxing (P = .007) and Run (P = .005). For participants poststroke, EE of walking at a comfortable did not differ from boxing games in standing or Run. For able-bodied participants only, the EE for Xbox-Boxing was higher than Wii-Boxing (6.5 ± 2.6 vs 4.4 ± 1.1, P = .02). EE was higher in standing versus sitting for poststroke (P = .04) and able-bodied (P = .03) participants. There were no significant group differences for RPEs. RER of playing in sitting approached anaerobic metabolism. Conclusions. Playing upper extremity (ie, Boxing) or mobility (ie, Run) AVGs in standing resulted in moderate EE and intensity for participants poststroke. EE was lower for poststroke than for able-bodied participants. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Recent research found that playing video games is able to serve mood management purposes as well as contribute to gratifications such as need satisfaction. Both aspects can foster the enjoyment as entertainment experience. The current study explores the question of how in-game success as a prerequisite for satisfying the need for competence and autonomy positively influences mood repair and game enjoyment. In a laboratory setting, participants were frustrated via a highly stressing math task and then played a video game (Mario Kart). Results show that in-game success drives mood repair as reflected in the experience of anger, happiness and activation. Moreover, fulfilling the intrinsic needs for competence and autonomy mediated the effects of in-game success and predicted enjoyment of the video game. Results are discussed in context of recent conceptualizations of media entertainment and the hierarchical order of emotional gratifications.

AB  - This article proposes the progression of a treatment from an individual setting to a family therapy. This family went through very painful years around the parents’ divorce, ten years ago. The treatment request came from the father sometime after a violent altercation between him and his 17-year-old son, which was followed by a break in their relationship. This individual therapy progressively integrates the two daughters, the son remaining out of the process. Various means contribute to this 'epic' therapy : work with emotions, EMDR, introduction of a reflecting team, goose game and finally a theatre production of Antigon rewritten by the family and played by the therapist with the family. The video of this therapy is viewed by all the family, with the son joining towards the end of the process. The personal resonance of the therapist echo to the writing work with the father and the two daughters, the scriptwriters and performers of Antigone.

AB  - Psychological research on video game participation has focused on understanding the effects of games on players, with the content of the game described by researchers. This media effects approach has been criticized as unnecessarily restricting the scope of psychological research on video games. It is suggested that psychology research can benefit from adopting an approach that seeks to understand the experience of game participants, as is often done in media and communications research. The present study surveyed undergraduates and respondents from a computer gaming Web site and asked them to describe what their most recent gaming experience meant to them. A qualitative analysis of the 173 participants revealed 57 themes that best captured these gaming experience descriptions, falling into six general categories: Emotional Responses, Game Play, Social, Outcomes of Game Play, Goals, and Personal Qualities. The results confirm previous research findings that video game participation is an emotionally enjoyable experience, which incorporates a strong social dimension, but they also indicate that video game play is highly goal-directed. Self-determination theory, which seeks to understand intrinsically motivated behavior in terms of the psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness, was suggested as the most relevant theoretical framework for understanding these results. Descriptions of game meaning by players were varied and complex, and it is suggested that future psychological research in this field incorporate more detailed assessment of player experiences in addition to the traditional approach of analyzing game content. New assessment techniques such as observation and objective measurement of in-game behavior should be included in psychological research studying video game play.

AB  - Early intervention and early education have a special place in educating the children with Impaired Hearing (IH). The advancements in information and communication technologies have led to adopting the view that such technologies could be applied in the educational process of the children with IH. Besides, the positive results acquired in the studies conducted in the light of this review have brought up the fact that proper technology-based educational environments should be provided and popularized for the young children with IH. In this study, educational software has been developed for the purpose of teaching emotions and opposite concepts to young children with IH. With this software, videos with topic descriptions, games reinforcing funny and topic-based learning, questions and audio-visual feedbacks have been used. The effectiveness of this software in concept education along with its usability by children has been examined; and in addition, the subjective viewpoints of the teachers of students with IH on this software have been consulted as well.

AB  - Purpose: Pathologic video game use (PVGU) has been associated with a host of negative psychological, physical, and social outcomes during adolescence; however, little research has examined physiological predictors of such use. The purpose of the study was to examine physiological predictors of the development of PVGU across adolescence. Methods: The article involves a 1-year longitudinal study across midadolescence. Participants were 374 adolescents and their parents from a large metropolitan area in the Northwest United States. PVGU was assessed via questionnaire, as were a number of control variables. A number of physiological indicators including respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and galvanic skin conductance (indices of parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system activity, respectively) were measured during baseline, a cognitively stimulating task (Rubik's cube), and a family problem-solving task. Results: Less RSA withdrawal to a cognitively simulating task was related to greater pathologic video game symptoms, but less RSA withdrawal to a family problem-solving task was associated with the presence of pathologic video game symptoms (p < .05). For girls only, galvanic skin conductance activation during the family problem solving was related to greater pathologic video game symptoms (p < .01). Conclusions: These findings suggest that adolescents who do not find cognitive tasks stimulating physiologically have a greater severity of PVGU. Additionally, adolescents who show physiological signs of stress in a family task were more likely to have PVGU symptoms and only girls have more severe PVGU levels. This study is the first to show that physiological indicators predict PVGU over time in adolescence and has important implications regarding the prevention and treatment of PVGU in adolescence.

AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies show that watching others' movements enhances motor evoked potential (MEPs) amplitude of the muscles involved in the observed action (motor facilitation, MF). MF has been attributed to a mirror neuron system mediated mechanism, causing an excitability increment of primary motor cortex. It is still unclear whether the meaning an action assumes when performed in an interpersonal exchange context could affect MF. This study aims at exploring this issue by measuring MF induced by the observation of the same action coupled with opposite reward values (gain vs loss) in an economic game. Moreover, the interaction frame was manipulated by showing the same actions within different economic games, the Dictator Game (DG) and the Theft Game (TG). Both games involved two players: a Dictator/Thief and a receiver. Experimental participants played the game always as receivers whereas the Dictator/Thief roles were played by our confederates. In each game Dictator/Thief's choices were expressed by showing a grasping action of one of two cylinders, previously associated with fair/unfair choices. In the DG the dictator decides whether to share (gain condition) or not (no-gain condition) a sum of money with the receiver, while in TGs the thief decides whether to steal (loss condition) or not to steal (no-loss condition) it from the participants. While the experimental subjects watched the videos showing these movements, a single TMS pulse was delivered to their motor hand area and a MEP was recorded from the right FDI muscle. Results show that, in the DG, MF was enhanced by the status quo modification, i.e. MEP amplitude increased when the dictator decided to change the receivers' status quo and share his/her money, and this was true when the status quo was more salient. The same was true for the TG, where the reverse happened: MF was higher for trials in which the thief decided to steal the participants' money, thus changing the status quo, in the block in which the status quo maintenance occurred more often. Data support the hypothesis that the economic meaning of the observed actions differently modulates MEP amplitude, pointing at an influence on MF exerted by a peculiar interaction between economic outcomes and variation of the subjects' initial status quo.

AB  - Human–human communication studies have suggested that within communicative interactions, individuals acknowledge each other as intentional agents and adjust their emotion nonverbal behavior according to the other. This process has been defined as emotional attunement. In this study, we examine the emotional attunement process in the context of affective human–computer interactions. To this purpose, participants were exposed to one of two conditions. In one case, they played with a computer that simulated understanding of their emotional reactions while guiding them across four different game-like activities; in the other, the computer guided participants across the activities without mentioning any ability to understand emotional responses. Face movements, gaze direction, posture, vocal behavior, electrocardiogram and electrodermal activity were simultaneously recorded during the experimental sessions. Results showed that if participants were aware of interacting with an agent able to recognize their emotions, they reported that the computer was able to 'understand' them and showed a higher number of nonverbal behaviors during the most interactive activity. The implications are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Playing the poker game variant No Limit Texas Hold'em (NLHE) requires constant and rapid decision making. Players need to continually assess the profitability of different actions with poker hands of varying strengths. Currently, little is known about how the decision-making processes required in NLHE are reflected in emotion-related physiological responses. Electrodermal activity (EDA) was measured from 29 healthy volunteers during playing a modified NLHE poker game on a computer. Predecision EDA was distinctly associated with various actions, increasing in the order of folding, calling and betting/raising. An association with poker hand strength and EDA was found. Actions taken with strong and weak hands elicited higher EDA compared with actions taken with hands of medium/uncertain strength. EDA is suggested to index the anticipated utility of poker game decisions, with anticipated utility increasing in the order of folding (no anticipated utility), calling (some anticipated utility) and betting/raising (high anticipated utility) actions.

AB  - Mental illness is common amongst young people living in residential care, many of who mare reluctant to avail of therapeutic help. The potential value of computer games as therapeutic tools for these young people has received very little attention, despite indications of their potential for promoting engagement in therapeutic work and improving mental health outcomes. This study aimed to fill this research gap through the development, introduction, and preliminary evaluation of a therapeutic intervention in group care settings. The intervention incorporated a commercially available computer game (The SIMS Life Stories™) and emotion regulation skill coaching. Qualified residential social workers were trained to deliver it to young people in three children's homes in Northern Ireland, where therapeutic approaches to social work had been introduced. The research was framed as an exploratory case study which aimed to determine the acceptability and potential therapeutic value of this intervention. The evidence suggests that computer-game based interventions of this type may have value as therapeutic tools in group care settings and deserve further development and empirical investigation to determine their effectiveness in improving mental health outcomes.

AB  - Recently, there have been considerable advances in the research on innovative information communication technology (ICT) for the education of people with autism. This review focuses on two aims: (1) to provide an overview of the recent ICT applications used in the treatment of autism and (2) to focus on the early development of imitation and joint attention in the context of children with autism as well as robotics. There have been a variety of recent ICT applications in autism, which include the use of interactive environments implemented in computers and special input devices, virtual environments, avatars and serious games as well as telerehabilitation. Despite exciting preliminary results, the use of ICT remains limited. Many of the existing ICTs have limited capabilities and performance in actual interactive conditions. Clinically, most ICT proposals have not been validated beyond proof of concept studies. Robotics systems, developed as interactive devices for children with autism, have been used to assess the child’s response to robot behaviors; to elicit behaviors that are promoted in the child; to model, teach and practice a skill; and to provide feedback on performance in specific environments (e.g., therapeutic sessions). Based on their importance for both early development and for building autonomous robots that have humanlike abilities, imitation, joint attention and interactive engagement are key issues in the development of assistive robotics for autism and must be the focus of further research.

AB  - [Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 17(11) of Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking (see record [rid]2014-49471-010[/rid]). The original article has been published with the incorrect title due to a clerical error on the part of the authors. The title should read, 'Associations Between Children's Video Game Playing and Psychosocial Health: Information from Both Parent and Child Reports.'] Video games are a highly heterogeneous form of entertainment. As recent reviews highlight, this heterogeneity makes likely that video games have both positive and negative consequences for child development. This study investigated the associations between gaming frequency and psychosocial health among children younger than 12 years of age, an understudied cohort in this field. Both parents and children reported children's gaming frequency, with parents also reporting on children's psychosocial health. Given that children may be too young to report the time they spend playing video games accurately, children's reports were scaffolded by a developmentally appropriate measure. We further investigated the potential bias of having parents report both their children's gaming frequency and their children's psychosocial health (i.e., a single source bias). Parental reports of children's gaming frequency were higher than their children's reports. However, a direct test of the potential single source bias rendered null results. Notably, however, while parental reports showed negative associations between gaming and psychosocial health, children's reports showed no associations. Specifically, based on parent reports, children's gaming was associated with more conduct and peer problems, and less prosocial behavior. As children's reports produced no associations between gaming and psychosocial health, parental reports in this study may belie an erroneous set of conclusions. We therefore caution against relying on just one reporter when assessing children's gaming frequency. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - [Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 24(3) of Journal de Thérapie Comportementale et Cognitive (see record [rid]2014-37061-008[/rid]). There were some errors in the original article. The correction were present in the erratum.] Studies on excessive video game use rarely focus on cognitive, emotional, and behavioral experience of video game players. CBTs for pathological gambling accurately address the cognitive processes of gamblers, but the typical functionings of video game players are not widely discussed in video game addiction CBT. This study clarifies these variables through content analysis of individual interviews conducted with frequent and/or excessive video game players. These players are characterized by high weekly gaming time (WGT), numerous years of playing practice and a PVP's score (Problem Video Game Playing Questionnaire) significantly correlated to WGT. These interviews focus on five key moments of the game: 'Before', 'During' and 'After' the game, and when 'Winning' or 'Losing'. A wide range of video games is taken into account both online and offline. The results, in conjunction with the existing literature, update variables known to cognitive psychology (various but specific emotions and physical manifestations; anticipatory, relief-oriented and permissive beliefs; attentional resources; etc.) and the dynamic richness of which is demonstrated according to the five playing moments. These specific variables provide a sound basis for studies concerning excessive video games use and for gaming experiences focused CBTs. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Storytelling in games in the early years of game studies was seen as being in conflict with gameplay. Departing from that debate, I argue that it is productive to see video games as a composite form supporting different frames for involvement. Against this backdrop the article reports an interview study with game developers, asking what it means to author stories for a composite form. The main results show that the developers do not see storytelling as the defining trait of video games, but as a component in a whole product. The developers display a specific gaze for how players shift their attention between frames. An important skill for the developers is to try to control these shifts in order to enforce the emotions they want the player to have. This specific skill is labelled framework orchestration. Stories are here but one of the tools the developers have at their disposal. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Does the delivery platform for a health behavior game contribute to its effectiveness? With the growing popularity of interactive video games that combine physical exercise with gameplay, known as 'exergames,' there has been a burgeoning interest in their impact on users’ exercise attitudes and behavioral outcomes. This study examines how the level of user interface embodiment, the degree to which the user’s body interacts with the game, affects the user’s experience, game behavior, and intention for behavior change. We conducted a between-participants experiment in which participants (N =119) played an exergame under one of the three levels of user interface embodiment (low, medium, and high). Our results revealed a significant positive main effect of user interface embodiment on user experience (i.e., the sense of being in the game, 'presence,' and enjoyment); level of energy expenditure (change in heart rate); and intention to further engage in exergame-play exercise but not necessarily to increase exercise in the physical world. A further analysis revealed the mediating roles of user experience in the association between user interface embodiment and intention to repeat exergaming and a potential link between heart rate change and level of presence in the game. We conclude that type of interface is a key variable in this health communication environment, affecting user experience, behavior, and some intention for behavior change.

AB  - Cirucci (2013a) hypothesized that video game players would display similarities to social media users and that this relationship should be examined. This inquiry compared university students who varied in the degree to which they use social media (SMU) and play video games (VGP) on several dream indices and 1 personality inventory. Dreams have been shown to be continuous with waking mentation (Schredl, 2003) and to regulate negative emotions (Levin & Nielsen, 2009). Thus, they may offer a relatively unobstrusive measure of reactions to media use. Although there were meaningful differences between the 4 groups (high VGP/high SMU; high VGP/low SMU; low VGP/high SMU; low VGP/low SMU), most analysis resulted in no differences in dreams. Differences seemed to support the nightmare protection thesis of video game play such that high-end gamers, no matter the degree of social media use, suffered less from these negative types of dreams. Additionally, the high VGP/high SMU group had the thinnest psychological boundaries and thus were perhaps most susceptible to media effects. While at the same time this group of high-end media users showed the least negative self concepts in their recent dream content. This was reflected in their typical dream reports as well.

AB  - Prior studies have indicated that learning mathematics is highly associated with attitudes towards mathematics and emotions like math anxiety. Over the years, strong empirical evidence has emerged, showing that math anxiety has a significant negative effect on mathematics performance. Interestingly enough, some researchers have shown that math anxiety can be trained and reduced. However, the proposed interventions have mostly focused on teachers as oppose to students, while the existing physiological approaches like cognitive behavioural therapy require administration by trained professionals. With recent advancements in technology, low cost commercial brain-computer interface (BCI) devices that can capture human emotions in real time have been developed and can have a potential use in training and reducing math anxiety. In this study, the objective was to determine if using a BCI mathematics educational game can help students to effectively reduce math anxiety. To attain this objective, a within-subjects longitudinal research design with eight data gathering waves was adopted as the primary methodology to ascertain changes in the participant's level of math anxiety across two sessions that took place on separate days. Analysis of data captured across two training sessions with a BCI mathematics educational game showed that math anxiety can be effectively trained and reduced with a BCI. In addition, the results showed that math anxiety has a significant negative impact on mathematics performance which is congruent with prior studies. These findings provide a novel way in which a low cost non-invasive BCI device can be used for educational purposes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background. Engagement has been identified as a crucial component of learning in games research. However, the conceptualization and operationalization of engagement vary widely in the literature. Many valuable approaches illuminate ways in which presence, flow, arousal, participation, and other concepts constitute or contribute to engagement. However, few studies examine multiple conceptualizations of engagement in the same project. Method. This article discusses the results of two experiments that measure engagement in five different ways: survey self-report, content analyses of player videos, electro-dermal activity, mouse movements, and game click logs. We examine the relationships among these measures and assess how they are affected by the technical characteristics of a 30-minute, custom-built, educational game: use of a customized character, level of narrative complexity, and level of art complexity. Results. We found that the five measures of engagement correlated in limited ways, and that they revealed substantially different relationships with game characteristics. We conclude that engagement as a construct is more complex than is captured in any of these measures individually and that using multiple methods to assess engagement can illuminate aspects of engagement not detectable by a single method of measurement.

AB  - A better understanding of how intentions and traits are perceived from body movements is required for the design of more effective virtual characters that behave in a socially realistic manner. For this purpose, realistic body motion, captured from human movements, is being used more frequently for creating characters with natural animations in games and entertainment. However, it is not always clear for programmers and designers which specific motion parameters best convey specific information such as certain emotions, intentions, or traits. We conducted two experiments to investigate whether the perceived traits of actors could be determined from their body motion, and whether these traits were associated with their perceived intentions. We first recorded body motions from 26 professional actors, who were instructed to move in a 'hero'-like or a 'villain'-like manner. In the first experiment, 190 participants viewed individual video recordings of these actors and were required to provide ratings to the body motion stimuli along a series of different cognitive dimensions (intentions, attractiveness, dominance, trustworthiness, and distinctiveness). The intersubject ratings across observers were highly consistent, suggesting that social traits are readily determined from body motion. Moreover, correlational analyses between these ratings revealed consistent associations across traits, for example, that perceived 'good' intentions were associated with higher ratings of attractiveness and dominance. Experiment 2 was designed to elucidate the qualitative body motion cues that were critical for determining specific intentions and traits from the hero- and villain-like body movements. The results revealed distinct body motions that were readily associated with the perception of either 'good' or 'bad' intentions. Moreover, regression analyses revealed that these ratings accurately predicted the perception of the portrayed character type. These findings indicate that intentions and social traits are communicated effectively via specific sets of body motion features. Furthermore, these results have important implications for the design of the motion of virtual characters to convey desired social information.

AB  - With the increasing potential for gaming hardware and peripherals to support biometrics, their application within the games industry for software and design should be considered. This paper assesses the ability to use a form of biometric measurement, heart rate, in real-time to improve the challenge and enjoyment of a game by catering it to individuals of varying ability. While the findings of this study are valuable to game developers interested in providing additional dimensions to gameplay and testing, they may also be useful for those researching medical or therapeutic applications for games. The results suggest that although the tested game was inherently challenging and enjoyable, the adaptive affective gameplay was not altering the game enough to induce strong physiological or emotional responses from participants. Biofeedback games lend themselves to medical applications, but adaptive affective games can be used to respond sympathetically to the player without requiring direct control of physiological responses as a form of input.

AB  - Participants in the current study were 75 males, including 25 Canadian soldiers, 25 heavy gamers who play military based video games such as 'Call of Duty,' and a control group comprised of 25 males. One dream per participant was analyzed using Hall and Van de Castle content analysis guidelines, including aggression, threat, and previously established scales for intensity of aggression and emotion. The dreams of soldiers had a higher frequency of both aggression and threat, and were also more intense in aggression and emotion than both the heavy gamers and the controls. These findings suggest that exposure to real life violence and threat (as well as the emotional significance of the experience) is more frequently incorporated into dream imagery than simulated or virtual threat. Limitations and directions for future studies are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - [Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 28(4) of Computers in Human Behavior (see record [rid]2012-11598-022[/rid]). In the original article, the affiliation is incorrectly listed for Eui Jun Jeong. The correct affiliation is present in the erratum.] Using a modified first-person shooter game, Counter Strike 2, this study tested (1) if the Yerkes–Dodson law could be applied to the relationship between physiological arousal (skin conductance) and brand memory in the new interactive technology setting; (2) if central and familiar ads are better recognized; and (3) if there are any interaction effects among arousal, centrality, and familiarity on brand memory. A pre-test was conducted to estimate the cut-off points of arousal into three levels (low, medium, and high) in the identical setting. Through within-subject analysis, a total of 550 cases were categorized into the three levels of arousal and analyzed. The results showed the highest recognition scores at the medium level of arousal, and no significant difference between the medium and high levels of arousal in brand memory. The participants remembered better centrally located brands than peripheral brands. Familiarity also had a positive relationship with the levels of arousal. Particularly, the recognition scores for centrally located brands increased with the levels of arousal, but no difference was found for peripheral brands. Findings and implications were discussed.

AB  - Virtual reality is the use of interactive simulations to present users with opportunities to perform in virtual environments that appear, sound, and less frequently, feel similar to real-world objects and events. Interactive computer play refers to the use of a game where a child interacts and plays with virtual objects in a computer-generated environment. Because of their distinctive attributes that provide ecologically realistic and motivating opportunities for active learning, these technologies have been used in pediatric rehabilitation over the past 15 years. The ability of virtual reality to create opportunities for active repetitive motor/sensory practice adds to their potential for neuroplasticity and learning in individuals with neurologic disorders. The objectives of this article is to provide an overview of how virtual reality and gaming are used clinically, to present the results of several example studies that demonstrate their use in research, and to briefly remark on future developments.

AB  - Three outstanding teachers stimulated my interest in alternative methods of education and made me receptive to simulations and games. At my first gaming conference, I discovered the value of simulations and games by playing games rather than by listening to lectures. I found the spirit of play and cooperation at NASAGA and ISAGA conferences refreshing and my games owe a considerable debt to the experienced gamers I met there. My experience facilitating games has taught me that allowing a few players to judge the work of their peers using subjective criteria leads to negative emotions, which may cancel any potential benefits of a game. I have also learned that the NEW COMMONS GAME, which illustrates the tragedy of the commons, may leave players feeling helpless and fatalistic about solving real-world commons problems. Several strategies are presented that counter negative feelings and instill optimism in players that commons problems can be solved. Recent developments in the video gaming community provide grounds for optimism about the future of educational gaming. However, it is imperative that video game designers who have an educational goal incorporate the knowledge that educational gamers have acquired over the past 50 years, such as the need for debriefing. A hypothetical, long-term, large-scale game is described that has the potential to educate students campuswide about how a commons resource can be sustained for the benefit of all. In addition, if the game is conducted across semesters or years, players’ responsibility to future generations of players could be studied and enhanced. However, the hypothetical game would require revising current thinking about debriefing. A brief description of the games I have designed is included.

AB  - Research investigating the effects of action video game experience on cognition has demonstrated a host of performance improvements on a variety of basic tasks. Given the prevailing evidence that these benefits result from efficient control of attentional processes, there has been growing interest in using action video games as a general tool to enhance everyday attentional control. However, to date, there is little evidence indicating that the benefits of action video game playing scale up to complex settings with socially meaningful stimuli—one of the fundamental components of our natural environment. The present experiment compared action video game player (AVGP) and non-video game player (NVGP) performance on an oculomotor capture task that presented participants with face stimuli. In addition, the expression of a distractor face was manipulated to assess if action video game experience modulated the effect of emotion. Results indicate that AVGPs experience less oculomotor capture than NVGPs; an effect that was not influenced by the emotional content depicted by distractor faces. It is noteworthy that this AVGP advantage emerged despite participants being unaware that the investigation had to do with video game playing, and participants being equivalent in their motivation and treatment of the task as a game. The results align with the notion that action video game experience is associated with superior attentional and oculomotor control, and provides evidence that these benefits can generalize to more complex and biologically relevant stimuli.

AB  - The question of why players of video games persist gaming in the face of what seems to be insufficient reward has not yet been properly answered. This paper approaches the issue by combining two general psychological theories: Self-determination Theory (Deci & Ryan, 2000) and Social Identity Theory (Tajfel & Turner, 1986). A large scale survey (N = 7252) enabled a comparison of three groups which differed in terms of their Gamer Identity Strength (GIS), namely the degree to which players define gaming as part of their social identity. GIS is highest in Hardcore gamers and lower for Heavy and Casual gamers. GIS was positively, and uniformly, related with needs for Competence, Autonomy and Relatedness. Meanwhile, regulation was greater and more internal in the higher GIS groups. Finally, persistence was found to increase with GIS. The structure of needs and regulation modes underlying persistence was comparatively analyzed for the three groups; similarities between GIS groups were more frequent than differences. Most importantly, results indicated that Casual and Heavy gamers were motivated to continue to play as a result of both the feelings of enjoyment and a sense of connectedness. Hardcore gamers were more intrinsically motivated through enjoyment enhancing their levels of persistence accordingly. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Previous research has demonstrated the tendency for humans to anthropomorphize computers—that is, to react to computers as social actors, despite knowing that the computers are mere machines. In the present research, we examined the attribution of both primary (non-uniquely human) and secondary (human-like) emotions to ingroup (teammate) and outgroup (opponent) computer-controlled characters in a video game. We found that participants perceived the teammate character as experiencing more secondary emotions than the opponent character, but that they perceived the teammate and opponent character as experiencing equal levels of primary emotions. Thus, participants anthropomorphized the ingroup character to a greater extent than the outgroup character. These results imply that computers’ 'emotions' are treated with a similar ingroup/outgroup social regard as the emotions of actual humans. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Purpose: Video-game playing is associated with an increased obesity risk. The association of video-game playing with body composition, physical activity and eating behaviour was investigated. Methods: A total of 45 young males (age range 18–27 years, BMI range 18.5–35.1 kg/m²) were recruited. Measurements of body composition and blood pressure were performed. The EPIC-FFQ questionnaire was used to assess dietary intake. A questionnaire battery was administered to assess physical activity, eating behaviour, sleep quality and frequency of video-game playing (hours/week). Subjects were categorised into frequent (>7 h/week) and non-frequent (≤7 h/week) players. Results: Frequent video-game players had greater waist circumference and fat mass. Video-game playing was significantly associated with high added sugar and low fibre consumption. A higher level of dietary restraint was observed in non-frequent video-game users. Conclusions: These preliminary results identify frequent video-game playing as an important lifestyle behaviour which may have important implications for understanding obesity risk in young male adults.

AB  - The interpersonal theory of suicidal behavior proposes that fearlessness of death and physical pain insensitivity is a necessary requisite for self-inflicted lethal self-harm. Repeated experiences with painful and provocative events are supposed to cause an incremental increase in acquired capability. The present study examined whether playing a first-person shooter-game in contrast to a first-person racing game increases pain tolerance, a dimension of the acquired capability construct, and risk-taking behavior, a risk factor for developing acquired capability. N = 81 male participants were randomly assigned to either play an action-shooter or a racing game before engaging in a game on risk-taking behavior and performing a cold pressor task (CPT). Participants exhibited higher pain tolerance after playing an action shooter game than after playing a racing game. Furthermore, playing an action shooter was generally associated with heightened risk-taking behavior. Group-differences were not attributable to the effects of the different types of games on self-reported mood and arousal. Overall these results indicate that action-shooter gaming alters pain tolerance and risk-taking behavior. Therefore, it may well be that long-term consumption of violent video games increases a person's capability to enact lethal self-harm. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This article explores the set of emotions expressed by middle school youth (n = 96) when participating in a social computer game. In this article, we present the design of the game, the instruments used to assess bullying in the physical world, and the analysis of the emotions expressed during gameplay and their association with aggressive behaviors. Participants completed surveys on bullying experiences prior to playing the game. The game required participants to form teams and answer two sets of trivia questions, in competitive and cooperative stages. Results show a relation between the roles that participants have in their physical social environment and how they play the virtual game, in terms of the type of emotions they display.

AB  - We report research on player modeling using psychophysiology and machine learning, conducted through interdisciplinary collaboration between researchers of computer science, psychology, and game design at Aalto University, Helsinki. First, we propose the Play Patterns And eXperience (PPAX) framework to connect three levels of game experience that previously had remained largely unconnected: game design patterns, the interplay of game context with player personality or tendencies, and state-of-the-art measures of experience (both subjective and non-subjective). Second, we describe our methodology for using machine learning to categorize game events to reveal corresponding patterns, culminating in an example experiment. We discuss the relation between automatically detected event clusters and game design patterns, and provide indications on how to incorporate personality profiles of players in the analysis. This novel interdisciplinary collaboration combines basic psychophysiology research with game design patterns and machine learning, and generates new knowledge about the interplay between game experience and design.

AB  - Although standard psychological treatments have been successful in treating several core features in eating disorders (ED), other characteristics such as emotional regulation or impulsivity appear to be more resistant to change. There is a growing body of evidence to support the efficacy of cognitive remediation for cognitive and emotional difficulties in ED. Playmancer/ Islands is a video game (VG) designed to specifically treat mental disorders, characterized by problems in impulse control. The objective of the game is to increase self‐control over emotions, decision making and behaviours. The aim of this study is to describe the results from a consecutive series of nine bulimia nervosa patients who were treated with the VG in addition to cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT). The outcomes included clinical and psychopathological questionnaires, and physiological measures were obtained during the VG. Emotional regulation improved, heart rate variability increased, and respiratory rate and impulsivity measures reduced after the treatment. These findings suggest that VG training may enhance treatment for ED. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The biological predisposition to resonate emotionally with another person is regarded as a critical aspect of social interaction. However, the emotional responses to others are often discordant with the object's (target's) emotional experience. The discrepant emotional responses are called 'counterempathy'. Based on the research of the two-stage process of emotion sharing proposed by Decety, and 'self-oriented' and 'other- orientated' emotional responses proposed by Goubet, we built the counterempathic emotion sharing process model under a competitive environment. Here we propose that in the counterempathic emotional sharing process, the individuals tend to generate stronger 'self- oriented' emotional response compared to the 'other-oriented' emotional response. The experiment was designed to test the enhancement effect of self- orientation on counterempathy by manipulating the orientation (self vs. other-orientation) and competitor's facial expressions (frown vs. smile). Participants (10 men; 19 women) were convinced that they were playing a card game with another player seated in the adjoining room. They were requested to make judgment of the participants' own win/lose and generate 'self- oriented' emotional response through the competitor's facial expressions (smile/frown) presented on the computer screen, similarly, to make judgment of the competitor's win/lose and generate 'other-oriented' emotional response. Reaction time, accuracy were collected during the tasks. To assess the manipulating effect of orientation, participants were required to complete emotional self-assessment scale at the end of each manipulating phase; and we analyzed the results using repeated-measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) with Orientation (self vs. other- orientation) and Facial Expressions (frown vs. smile) as within-subjects variables. We observed a clear enhancement effect of self-orientation on counterempathy. Participants responded with an asymmetric emotion towards the competitor automatically both in the 'self-oriented' and 'other-oriented' condition. Participants had a higher accuracy and showed stronger asymmetric valence ratings to the competitor in the 'self-oriented' condition compared to 'other-oriented' condition; besides, they responded slower and showed more negative valence ratings to the competitor's winning in the 'self-oriented' condition. The results of the study support the enhancement effect of self-orientation on counterempathy. The results indicate that individuals could respond with asymmetric emotion towards their competitors automatically not only in the 'self-oriented' condition, but also in the 'other- oriented' condition, suggesting that the individuals tend to generate stronger 'self- oriented' emotional response, while Decety only mentioned the 'other-oriented 'emotional response which induces empathic concern in the conscious emotional sharing process. Moreover, 'self-oriented' condition strengthens individuals' asymmetric emotional response compare to 'other-oriented' condition, especially for the competitor's winning.

AB  - The relationship between digital game play and second language (L2) learning is a particularly tricky issue in East Asia. Though there is an emerging presence of Chinese online games, many more young people are playing the English- or Japanese-language versions of the most popular commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) video games. In other words, most Chinese gamers are playing L2 digital games in their leisure time. Informed by research on out-of-class L2 learning, this paper discusses findings from an exploratory study investigating L2 gaming and learning practices in young people’s everyday lives. Drawing on rich data from gaming sessions, stimulated recall, focus group discussion, individual interviews and online discussion forums, this paper argues that gamers exercise autonomy by managing their gameplay both as leisure and learning practices in different dimensions (location, formality, locus of control, pedagogy and trajectory). At the same time, gameplay-as-learning practices are supported by wider communities of digital gamers who take on roles as language teachers and advisers. The paper suggests that activities in these dimensions mediated learning autonomously and from community, and discusses the research and pedagogical implications for L2 gaming and learning.

AB  - Happy faces are categorized faster than sad or angry faces (Happy Face Advantage). Violent video game play, in addition to having negative effects on social behavior, can lead to a reduction of the HFA, speeding up the categorization of angry faces. However, it is not clear whether violent video game play could have an effect on facial emotion categorization accuracy. The goal of our study was to investigate whether the use of a violent videogame could have an impact on accuracy rates in a fast categorization task of happy and angry faces. 24 students were asked to play either a neutral (N = 12) or a violent (N = 12) videogame, and subsequently to categorize emotional faces. Participants who played the violent videogame committed more errors with happy faces (by categorizing them as angry) than those who played the neutral videogame, thus indicating that violent videogames could cause a categorization bias, leading to the recognition of happy faces as hostile faces.

AB  - This second of two articles concludes the examination of narrative in computer and video games. Where appropriate, results are schematically and chronologically presented to illustrate the unique nature of interactive narrative. Despite modern advances in games technology and design, the findings reveal notable gaps in areas such as the use of back stories, cut scenes, narrative structure and content, emotions, and archetypes, all of which may be expanded to offer richer and potentially more believable narratives. The findings from both essays draw attention to three salient aspects warranting greater efforts during the future development of interactive narrative: temporal, depth, and depiction.

AB  - This article describes a pilot study in which a novel experimental setup, involving an autonomous humanoid robot, KASPAR, participating in a collaborative, dyadic video game, was implemented and tested with children with autism, all of whom had impairments in playing socially and communicating with others. The children alternated between playing the collaborative video game with a neurotypical adult and playing the same game with the humanoid robot, being exposed to each condition twice. The equipment and experimental setup were designed to observe whether the children would engage in more collaborative behaviours while playing the video game and interacting with the adult than performing the same activities with the humanoid robot. The article describes the development of the experimental setup and its first evaluation in a small-scale exploratory pilot study. The purpose of the study was to gain experience with the operational limits of the robot as well as the dyadic video game, to determine what changes should be made to the systems, and to gain experience with analyzing the data from this study in order to conduct a more extensive evaluation in the future. Based on our observations of the childrens’ experiences in playing the cooperative game, we determined that while the children enjoyed both playing the game and interacting with the robot, the game should be made simpler to play as well as more explicitly collaborative in its mechanics. Also, the robot should be more explicit in its speech as well as more structured in its interactions. Results show that the children found the activity to be more entertaining, appeared more engaged in playing, and displayed better collaborative behaviours with their partners (For the purposes of this article, ‘partner’ refers to the human/robotic agent which interacts with the children with autism. We are not using the term’s other meanings that refer to specific relationships or emotional involvement between two individuals.) in the second sessions of playing with human adults than during their first sessions. One way of explaining these findings is that the children’s intermediary play session with the humanoid robot impacted their subsequent play session with the human adult. However, another longer and more thorough study would have to be conducted in order to better re-interpret these findings. Furthermore, although the children with autism were more interested in and entertained by the robotic partner, the children showed more examples of collaborative play and cooperation while playing with the human adult.

AB  - The creation of intelligent video game controllers has recently become one of the greatest challenges in game artificial intelligence research, and it is arguably one of the fastest-growing areas in game design and development. The learning process, a very important feature of intelligent methods, is the result of an intelligent game controller to determine and control the game objects behaviors’ or actions autonomously. Our approach is to use a more efficient learning model in the form of artificial neural networks for training the controllers. We propose a Hill-Climbing Neural Network (HillClimbNet) that controls the movement of the Ms. Pac-man agent to travel around the maze, gobble all of the pills and escape from the ghosts in the maze. HillClimbNet combines the hill-climbing strategy with a simple, feed-forward artificial neural network architecture. The aim of this study is to analyze the performance of various activation functions for the purpose of generating neural-based controllers to play a video game. Each non-linear activation function is applied identically for all the nodes in the network, namely log-sigmoid, logarithmic, hyperbolic tangent-sigmoid and Gaussian. In general, the results shows an optimum configuration is achieved by using log-sigmoid, while Gaussian is the worst activation function. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - How can we overcome apathy and instigate a desire to help others? This research tests and compares the prosocial effects of two of the most prototypical emotions on a range of prosocial intentions and behaviors. Emotion-inducing videos were used to instigate states of moral elevation (felt when witnessing a moral virtue) and/or moral outrage (felt when witnessing a moral transgression). Although elevation and outrage are derived from opposing appraisals, separate strands of research show that they both instigate a desire to help others. The current research tests the appraisal tendency framework to explore whether elevation and outrage increase prosociality across moral domains or whether their prosocial effects are domain specific. Results of Experiment 1 showed that elevation, but not outrage, increased donations to charity (i.e., benevolence domain). Experiment 2 showed that outrage, but not elevation, increased prosocial political action intentions (i.e., justice domain). Experiment 3 showed that outrage, but not elevation, increased compensation in a third-party bystander game (i.e., justice domain). This research shows that although elevation and outrage both inspire a desire to help others, they affect distinct types of prosocial behaviors, offering support for the appraisal tendency framework. Applied and theoretical implications are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Video-gaming is an increasingly prevalent activity among children and adolescents that is known to influence several areas of emotional, cognitive and behavioural functioning. Currently there is insufficient experimental evidence about how extended video-game play may affect adolescents’ sleep. The aim of this study was to investigate the short-term impact of adolescents’ prolonged exposure to violent video-gaming on sleep. Seventeen male adolescents (mean age = 16 ± 1 years) with no current sleep difficulties played a novel, fast-paced, violent videogame (50 or 150 min) before their usual bedtime on two different testing nights in a sleep laboratory. Objective (polysomnography-measured sleep and heart rate) and subjective (single-night sleep diary) measures were obtained to assess the arousing effects of prolonged gaming. Compared with regular gaming, prolonged gaming produced decreases in objective sleep efficiency (by 7 ± 2%, falling below 85%) and total sleep time (by 27 ± 12 min) that was contributed by a near-moderate reduction in rapid eye movement sleep (Cohen’s d = 0.48). Subjective sleep-onset latency significantly increased by 17 ± 8 min, and there was a moderate reduction in self-reported sleep quality after prolonged gaming (Cohen’s d = 0.53). Heart rate did not differ significantly between video-gaming conditions during pre-sleep game-play or the sleep-onset phase. Results provide evidence that prolonged video-gaming may cause clinically significant disruption to adolescent sleep, even when sleep after video-gaming is initiated at normal bedtime. However, physiological arousal may not necessarily be the mechanism by which technology use affects sleep. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Research indicates that coactors performing cooperative tasks often exhibit spontaneous and unintended similarities in their physiological and behavioral responses—a phenomenon referred to here as physio-behavioral coupling (PBC). The purpose of this research was to identify contributors to PBC; examine relationships between PBC, team performance, and perceived team attributes (e.g., cohesion, trust); and compare a set of time-series measures(cross-correlation [CC], cross-recurrence quantification analysis [CRQA], and cross-fuzzy entropy [CFEn]) in their characterization of PBC across comparisons. To accomplish this, PBC was examined in human postural sway (PS) and cardiac interbeat intervals (IBIs) from dyadic teams performing a fast-paced puzzle task (Quadra—a variant of the video game Tetris). Results indicated that observed levels of PBC were not a chance occurrence, but instead driven by features of the team-task environment, and that PBC was likely influenced by similar individual task demands and interpersonal coordination dynamics that were not 'unique' to a particular team. Correlation analysis revealed that PBC exhibited negative relationships with team performance and team attributes, which were interpreted to reflect complementary coordination (as opposed to mimicry) during task performance, potentially due to differentiated team roles. Finally, qualitative comparison of time-series measures used to characterize PBC indicated that CRQA percent recurrence and CFEn (both nonlinear measures) settled on mostly analogous characterizations, whereas linear CC did not. The disparity observed between the linear and nonlinear measures highlights underlying computational and interpretational differences between the two families of statistics and supports the use of multiple metrics for characterizing PBC.

AB  - Both oxytocin (OT) and vasopressin (AVP) are known to modulate social behavior, and dysfunction in both systems has been postulated as a potential cause of certain psychiatric disorders that involve social behavioral deficits. In particular, there is growing interest in intranasal OT as a potential treatment for certain psychiatric disorders, and preliminary pre-clinical and clinical studies suggest efficacy in alleviating some of the associated symptoms. However, the vast majority of research participants in these studies have been male, and there is evidence for sexually differentiated effects of nonapeptides in both humans and non-human animals. To date, no study has investigated the effect of intranasal OT on brain function in human males and females within the same paradigm. Previously, in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind fMRI study, we reported effects of intranasal OT and AVP on behavior and brain activity of human males as they played an interactive social game known as the Prisoner's Dilemma Game. Here, we present findings from an identical study in human females, and compare these with our findings from males. Overall, we find that both behavioral and neural responses to intranasal OT and AVP are highly sexually differentiated. In women, AVP increased conciliatory behavior, and both OT and AVP caused women to treat computer partners more like humans. In men, AVP increased reciprocation of cooperation from both human and computer partners. However, no specific drug effects on behavior were shared between men and women. During cooperative interactions, both OT and AVP increased brain activity in men within areas rich in OT and AVP receptors and in areas playing a key role in reward, social bonding, arousal and memory (e.g., the striatum, basal forebrain, insula, amygdala and hippocampus), whereas OT and AVP either had no effect or in some cases actually decreased brain activity in these regions in women. OT treatment rendered neural responses of males more similar to responses of females in the placebo group and vice versa, raising the prospect of an inverted u-shaped dose response to central OT levels. These findings emphasize the need to fully characterize the effects of intranasal OT and AVP in both males and females and at multiple doses before widespread clinical application will be warranted.

AB  - This article introduces a teacher–student framework for reinforcement learning, synthesising and extending material that appeared in conference proceedings [Torrey, L., & Taylor, M. E. (2013)]. Teaching on a budget: Agents advising agents in reinforcement learning. {Proceedings of the international conference on autonomous agents and multiagent systems}] and in a non-archival workshop paper [Carboni, N., &Taylor, M. E. (2013, May)]. Preliminary results for 1 vs. 1 tactics in StarCraft. {Proceedings of the adaptive and learning agents workshop (at AAMAS-13)}]. In this framework, a teacher agent instructs a student agent by suggesting actions the student should take as it learns. However, the teacher may only give such advice a limited number of times. We present several novel algorithms that teachers can use to budget their advice effectively, and we evaluate them in two complex video games: StarCraft and Pac-Man. Our results show that the same amount of advice, given at different moments, can have different effects on student learning, and that teachers can significantly affect student learning even when students use different learning methods and state representations.

AB  - This article provides an insight into the effectiveness of educational computer games. Based on a literature research, the effectiveness is illustrated in detail with regard to the questions: what characterize educational computer games, how do learners learn from it and what are the learning outcomes? Although games are connected with the hope of better learning through learners' activities, its effectiveness has been criticized. To further advance game research and design decisions, the question is discussed from a cognitive load perspective and emotional point of view of learners that consider important variables when designing educational computer games. In line with this question, a literatur review is done on researchers' own study, in which an exemplary empirical support for learners' cognitive load through learning with games was found. Finally, the article ends with some comments on the relationship of instructional design to effective games by outlining and discussing implications for educational practice that integrate not only learning outcomes of games but also the cognitive processes and emotions of learners during gameplaying.

AB  - Reports an error in 'Stressful gaming, interoceptive awareness, and emotion regulation tendencies: A novel approach' by Adam Lobel, Isabela Granic, Lisanne L. Stone and Rutger C. M. E. Engels (Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking, 2014[Oct], Vol 17[10], 639-643). The original article has been published with the incorrect title due to a clerical error on the part of the authors. The title should read, 'Associations Between Children's Video Game Playing and Psychosocial Health: Information from Both Parent and Child Reports.' (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2014-42870-002[/rid]). Video games are a highly heterogeneous form of entertainment. As recent reviews highlight, this heterogeneity makes likely that video games have both positive and negative consequences for child development. This study investigated the associations between gaming frequency and psychosocial health among children younger than 12 years of age, an understudied cohort in this field. Both parents and children reported children's gaming frequency, with parents also reporting on children's psychosocial health. Given that children may be too young to report the time they spend playing video games accurately, children's reports were scaffolded by a developmentally appropriate measure. We further investigated the potential bias of having parents report both their children's gaming frequency and their children's psychosocial health (i.e., a single source bias). Parental reports of children's gaming frequency were higher than their children's reports. However, a direct test of the potential single source bias rendered null results. Notably, however, while parental reports showed negative associations between gaming and psychosocial health, children's reports showed no associations. Specifically, based on parent reports, children's gaming was associated with more conduct and peer problems, and less prosocial behavior. As children's reports produced no associations between gaming and psychosocial health, parental reports in this study may belie an erroneous set of conclusions. We therefore caution against relying on just one reporter when assessing children's gaming frequency. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to assess the effectiveness of field sponsorship through sponsor recall and recognition across two environments that differ on the degree of felt presence they trigger among viewers: on-site and television. A series of research hypotheses concerning the interaction effects of viewing environment, event—sponsor congruence and arousal intensity were developed. Design/methodology/approach: To test the effect of the viewing environment, a field experiment was conducted where 44 ice hockey fans attended a professional ice hockey game in the local team’s arena, whereas 44 others saw the same game, at the same time, on television. The participants were randomly assigned to one of the two game viewing conditions. Findings: A higher level of arousal was detrimental to sponsor identification in a manner consistent with the intensity of the processing principle according to which arousal polarizes attention resources on the arousing stimulus (the event) while diverting resources away from the peripheral stimuli (the sponsors). In addition, because the event congruent sponsors are more superficially processed in comparison with the incongruent ones, this negative impact was more pronounced in the former group. This was qualified by a three-way interaction with the type of environment; the on-site, direct, audience was less affected by the processing intensity principle and exhibited better recall and recognition than the television audience as arousal and congruency increased, whereas, at lower levels of arousal, higher event—sponsor congruence hampered on-site sponsor identification in comparison with television. Research limitations/implications: The findings were obtained in the context of a single sports event; additional studies need to be conducted using different sports. In addition, the comparison of on-site audience with other types of media audiences (e.g. on-line broadcasting) is warranted. Practical implications: Arousal intensity results from the game’s drama, which is a function of game importance and game outcome uncertainty. Hence, except for low-stakes games (e.g. pre-season matches, exhibitions), initiatives that promote a leveled playing field such as salary cap, financial fair play and open leagues are likely to jeopardize sponsor identification, particularly for congruent sponsors. With respect to the impact of the viewing environment, congruent sponsors should reap superior benefits from the television audience when the stakes are low. However, when the stakes are high, their benefits will accrue to a greater extent from on-site spectators. Originality/value: This is the first study to offer a rigorous comparison of sponsorship’s impact on direct (on-site) versus indirect (television) audiences through a field experiment. This is also the first research to provide a framework based on the processing intensity principle that encompasses predictions related to arousal and its interaction with event—sponsor congruence and the viewing environment. Within this perspective, the degree of sponsor integration in the viewing environment is instrumental in predicting sponsorship outcomes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Reports an error in 'Cognitive, emotional, and behavioral determinants involved in the use of video games: Towards a better understanding of excessive gaming for CBT interventions' by Pierre Taquet, Marc Hautekeete and Élise Gorgeu (Journal de Thérapie Comportementale et Cognitive, 2014[Jun], Vol 24[2], 53-62). There were some errors in the original article. The correction were present in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2014-25362-004[/rid]). Studies on excessive video game use rarely focus on cognitive, emotional, and behavioral experience of video game players. CBTs for pathological gambling accurately address the cognitive processes of gamblers, but the typical functionings of video game players are not widely discussed in video game addiction CBT. This study clarifies these variables through content analysis of individual interviews conducted with frequent and/or excessive video game players. These players are characterized by high weekly gaming time (WGT), numerous years of playing practice and a PVP's score (Problem Video Game Playing Questionnaire) significantly correlated to WGT. These interviews focus on five key moments of the game: 'Before', 'During' and 'After' the game, and when 'Winning' or 'Losing'. A wide range of video games is taken into account both online and offline. The results, in conjunction with the existing literature, update variables known to cognitive psychology (various but specific emotions and physical manifestations; anticipatory, relief-oriented and permissive beliefs; attentional resources; etc.) and the dynamic richness of which is demonstrated according to the five playing moments. These specific variables provide a sound basis for studies concerning excessive video games use and for gaming experiences focused CBTs. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The creative industries have recently been hailed as presenting a liberating model for the future of work and a valuable terrain on which to examine purported new regimes of workplace control. This article, based on the empirical examination of a Canadian video game development studio, traces the modes of control which operate on and through project teams in creative settings. The impact of the adoption of an ‘emancipatory’, post-bureaucratic project management technology, ‘Agile’, is critically examined through interviews and non-participative observation of management, technical and artistic labour within one project team. The potential for autonomy in such ‘Agile’ teams is critically assessed within the managerial regime of creative production and the broader power relations implied by the financial, organizational and institutional context.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to examine differences in emotion expression and emotion regulation in emotion-eliciting situations in early adolescence from a bio-psycho-social perspective, specifically investigating the influence of early mother-infant attachment and attachment disorganization on behavioural and adrenocortical responses. The sample consisted of 96 children of the Regensburg Longitudinal Study IV. At age 12 months, attachment security and disorganization were assessed in the Strange Situation. At age 12 years, the adolescents were observed together with their mother during a computer game (eliciting anger) and the 'Talk Show Task' (eliciting fear). Analyses included self-ratings and mother-ratings of the adolescents’ emotions (anger and fear), observations of the adolescents’ emotional expression and emotional regulation (social regulation, effective regulation) as well as concurrent maternal emotional support. In addition, adrenocortical activity was assessed from saliva samples before and after observation. The findings revealed different patterns of social-emotional responses depending on early attachment security. Adolescents with secure infant attachment reported more anger, when anger was induced, were rated as less anxious by their mothers, and their emotion self-ratings were more similar to their mothers’ ratings compared to adolescents with an early insecure attachment. An increased adrenocortical response was only found in the group of adolescents with attachment disorganization in infancy, especially with increased fear.

AB  - The experience of frustration is common in early childhood, yet some children seem to possess a lower tolerance for frustration than others. Characterizing the biological mechanisms underlying a wide range of frustration tolerance observed in early childhood may inform maladaptive behavior and psychopathology that is associated with this construct. The goal of this study was to measure prefrontal correlates of frustration in 3–5-year-old children, who are not readily adaptable for typical neuroimaging approaches, using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). fNIRS of frontal regions were measured as frustration was induced in children through a computer game where a desired and expected prize was 'stolen' by an animated dog. A fNIRS general linear model (GLM) was used to quantify the correlation of brain regions with the task and identify areas that were statistically different between the winning and frustrating test conditions. A second-level voxel-based ANOVA analysis was then used to correlate the amplitude of each individual's brain activation with measure of parent-reported frustration. Experimental results indicated increased activity in the middle prefrontal cortex during winning of a desired prize, while lateral prefrontal cortex activity increased during frustration. Further, activity increase in lateral prefrontal cortex during frustration correlated positively with parent-reported frustration tolerance. These findings point to the role of the lateral prefrontal cortex as a potential region supporting the regulation of emotion during frustration.

AB  - Emotion suppression is a form of emotion regulation defined as the conscious inhibition of emotionally expressive behavior while emotionally aroused. Previous research has shown that inhibiting emotionally expressive behavior leads to depletion of self-regulatory capacities and increased sympathetic activation of the cardiovascular system. Evidence from decision-making research has indicated that the cognitive-affective component was modulated by the attributes of options when making choice. This process was monitored by the individual and required an effort of self-regulation. Drawing from a limited-resource model of self-regulation, we predicted that emotion suppression would impact the subsequent decision making task due to the depletion of the self-regulatory capacity. The study was designed to investigate the effects of emotion suppression and its influence on the behavioral responses of respondents in the ultimatum game, using methods of psycho-physiological experiments. Participants were 20 female and 20 male college students. Ten negative pictures were presented to all the participants. Half of them were instructed to suppress their emotions and the other half simply watch the pictures, and then all the participants were instructed to play as the responders in the ultimatum game presented on the video monitor. Physiological measures were collected continuously throughout the whole procedure. Emotional states before and after watching the pictures were assessed by using a self-report inventory, which contained 5 emotional states: amusement, anger, disgust, fear and sadness. The experimental design was a 2×2×4 mixed factorial, in which group condition (no-suppression, suppression) varied between subjects, and game rival (human, computer) as well as money proposals (￥5:￥5、￥:￥3、￥8:￥2、￥9:￥1) varied within subjects. The results showed that: (1) the Repeated Measure ANOVA for the self-report variables did not reveal any effects with respect to group condition, indicating that the suppression instructions did not impact the emotion self-reports. (2) participants under the suppression condition showed more increases in skin conductance, however, the heart rate did not show the significant differences across the suppression manipulation. (3) there were no sex differences in the effects of suppression. (4) the interaction between group condition and money proposals on subjects’ acceptance rate in UG was found, which indicated that the behavior of the game players as they responded to an unfair proposal was influenced by suppression manipulation. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that suppression had no effect on self-reported experiences of negative emotions. Inhibiting negative emotion-expressive behavior led to increased sympathetic activation characterized by increased skin conductance activity. Emotion suppression had a significant influence on the UG decisions: participants in the emotion suppression condition, when faced with unfair offers, were more likely to refuse the offer.

AB  - Introduction: Most of our learning activity takes place in a social context. I examined how social interactions influence associative learning in neurodegenerative diseases and atypical neurodevelopmental conditions primarily characterised by social cognitive and memory dysfunctions. Methods: Participants were individuals with high-functioning autism (HFA, n = 18), early-stage behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD, n = 16) and Alzheimer's disease (AD, n = 20). The leading symptoms in HFA and bvFTD were social and behavioural dysfunctions, whereas AD was characterised by memory deficits. Participants received three versions of a paired associates learning task. In the game with boxes test, objects were hidden in six candy boxes placed in different locations on the computer screen. In the game with faces, each box was labelled by a photo of a person. In the real-life version of the game, participants played with real persons. Results: Individuals with HFA and bvFTD performed well in the computer games, but failed on the task including real persons. In contrast, in patients with early-stage AD, social interactions boosted paired associates learning up to the level of healthy control volunteers. Worse performance in the real life game was associated with less successful recognition of complex emotions and mental states in the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test. Spatial span did not affect the results. Conclusions: When social cognition is impaired, but memory systems are less compromised (HFA and bvFTD), real-life interactions disrupt associative learning; when disease process impairs memory systems but social cognition is relatively intact (early-stage AD), social interactions have a beneficial effect on learning and memory.

AB  - Background: PlayMancer is a video game designed to increase emotional regulation and reduce general impulsive behaviors, by training to decrease arousal and improve decision-making and planning. We have previously demonstrated the usefulness of PlayMancer in reducing impulsivity and improving emotional regulation in bulimia nervosa (BN) patients. However, whether these improvements are actually translated into brain changes remains unclear. Objective: The aim of this case study was to report on a 28-year-old Spanish woman with BN, and to examine changes in physiological variables and brain activity after a combined treatment of video game therapy (VGT) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Methods: Ten VGT sessions were carried out on a weekly basis. Anxiety, physiological, and impulsivity measurements were recorded. The patient was scanned in a 1.5-T magnetic resonance scanner, prior to and after the 10-week VGT/CBT combined treatment, using two paradigms: (1) an emotional face-matching task, and (2) a multi-source interference task (MSIT). Results: Upon completing the treatment, a decrease in average heart rate was observed. The functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) results indicated a post-treatment reduction in reaction time along with high accuracy. The patient engaged areas typically active in healthy controls, although the cluster extension of the active areas decreased after the combined treatment. Conclusions: These results suggest a global improvement in emotional regulation and impulsivity control after the VGT therapy in BN, demonstrated by both physiological and neural changes. These promising results suggest that a combined treatment of CBT and VGT might lead to functional cerebral changes that ultimately translate into better cognitive and emotional performances.

AB  - Forty-seven undergraduates were asked to conduct a computer game task and longitudinal method was employed to explore features and influencing factors of autonomic nervous system changes in different stages. During the task, emotion reaction indexes were recorded synchronously with biofeedback instruments. The indexes included spectrum domains of HRV (HF: high frequency, LF: low frequency) , skin temperature, skin conduction and heart rate. The results are as follows: (1) In the anticipation period, the values of LF and HF were much higher than those of other periods significantly. During the coping period, values of skin conduction and heart rate were significantly higher than those of other periods and the value of skin temperature was lower than that of others. (2) ANS in different stages had different modes, but mutual activation modes and NA inhibited modes were the primary modes. We reachad the conclusion: (1 )The pattern of different ANS were proved in this research from the aspects of time and provided new proof for Berntson's theory. (2) Different tasks' psychological components and individual differences collectively affected the changes of ANS. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

The current study used event-related brain potentials (ERPs) to examine the effects of playing an action or non-action video game on the processing of emotion in facial expression. The data revealed that 10 h of playing an action or non-action video game had differential effects on the ERPs relative to a no-contact control group. Playing an action game resulted in two effects: one that reflected an increase in the amplitude of the ERPs following training over the right frontal and posterior regions that was similar for angry, happy, and neutral faces; and one that reflected a reduction in the allocation of attention to happy faces. In contrast, playing a non-action game resulted in changes in slow wave activity over the central–parietal and frontal regions that were greater for targets (i.e., angry and happy faces) than for non-targets (i.e., neutral faces). These data demonstrate that the contrasting effects of action video games on visuospatial and emotion processing occur in the same individuals following the same level of gaming experience. This observation leads to the suggestion that caution should be exercised when using action video games to modify visual processing, as this experience could also have unintended effects on emotion processing.

AB  - Using the technology acceptance model (TAM), this study aimed to investigate the acceptability of video game technologies (serious games) for medical emergency procedure and decision making training. Using the Triage Trainer, a prototype serious game for the triage sieve process, differences between gamers and non-gamers, males and females, and the effects of ratings of computer self efficacy (i.e. computer skill and gaming skill) and attitudes towards computers (i.e. enthusiasm and anxiety) on the acceptance model were also investigated. The results show significant correlations for computer self-efficacy and attitude variables with the perceived ease of use (PEOU), perceived usefulness (PU) and attitudes towards use (ATU) of the game. Multiple regression showed that 52% of the variance in ATU was explained by the PU and PEOU. However, none of the secondary variables (self efficacy or emotions) had a significant effect on the ATU, PU and PEOU over and above each other.

AB  - The negative impacts of excessive and problematic video game playing on both children and adults are attracting increasing concern. Based on self-determination theory (SDT; Ryan & Deci, 2000), this study hypothesized that the three basic psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness are positively associated with purpose in life, which in turn acts as a protective factor against problem video game playing among Chinese young adult players. Through a questionnaire survey with a sample of 165 Chinese adults aged between 18 and 30 years (mean age = 22.7 years), we found that perceived autonomy, competence, relatedness, and purpose in life were all negatively correlated with problem game playing. The demographic and psychological factors explained 38% of the variances of problem game playing. Specifically, gender, perceived relatedness, and purpose in life emerged as the three most salient predictors of problem game playing among the Chinese young adults. The mediating role of purpose in life was evidenced and it was found that purpose in life mediated the influences of the psychological needs proposed by SDT on problem game playing. Moreover, young men were significantly more susceptible to problem game playing than their female counterparts. To conclude, psychological needs and purpose in life influenced Chinese young adults’ vulnerability to problem game playing directly or indirectly. Intervention programs that encourage social involvement and voluntary work, as well as counseling service that helps clients to search for life purpose, are suggested for intervening in problem game playing among Chinese young adults.

AB  - Background: Today’s cell phones increase opportunities for activities traditionally defined as sedentary behaviors (e.g., surfing the internet, playing video games). People who participate in large amounts of sedentary behaviors, relative to those who do not, tend to be less physically active, less physically fit, and at greater risk for health problems. However, cell phone use does not have to be a sedentary behavior as these devices are portable. It can occur while standing or during mild-to-moderate intensity physical activity. Thus, the relationship between cell phone use, physical and sedentary activity, and physical fitness is unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate these relationships among a sample of healthy college students. Methods: Participants were first interviewed about their physical activity behavior and cell phone use. Then body composition was assessed and the validated self-efficacy survey for exercise behaviors completed. This was followed by a progressive exercise test on a treadmill to exhaustion. Peak oxygen consumption (VO₂ peak) during exercise was used to measure cardiorespiratory fitness. Hierarchical regression was used to assess the relationship between cell phone use and cardiorespiratory fitness after controlling for sex, self-efficacy, and percent body fat. Interview data was transcribed, coded, and Chi-square analysis was used to compare the responses of low and high frequency cell phone users. Results: Cell phone use was significantly (p = 0.047) and negatively (β = −0.25) related to cardio respiratory fitness independent of sex, self-efficacy, and percent fat which were also significant predictors (p < 0.05). Interview data offered several possible explanations for this relationship. First, high frequency users were more likely than low frequency users to report forgoing opportunities for physical activity in order to use their cell phones for sedentary behaviors. Second, low frequency users were more likely to report being connected to active peer groups through their cell phones and to cite this as a motivation for physical activity. Third, high levels of cell phone use indicated a broader pattern of sedentary behaviors apart from cell phone use, such as watching television. Conclusion: Cell phone use, like traditional sedentary behaviors, may disrupt physical activity and reduce cardiorespiratory fitness. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This article reviews the recent literature on uses, effects, and gratifications of media during emerging adulthood. We examine traditional media forms, including television, films, video games, music, and books, and also newer media, such as cell phones, social networking sites, and other Internet use. We find that emerging adults spend more time using the media than they spend doing any other activity, with the most time being spent on the Internet and listening to music. We also find that exposure to certain types of media content can influence both positive and negative outcomes in emerging adulthood, including, aggressive and prosocial behavior, body image, sexual behavior, friendship quality, and academic achievement. We also show that emerging adults use the media to gratify certain needs; key among these are for autonomy, identity, and intimacy needs. Finally, we discuss areas for future research involving media and emerging adulthood. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Introduction. The concept of video game addiction is not universally accepted in scientific literature. However, some authors agree on linking excessive video game behavior to the concept of addiction. This article gives a detailed presentation of a case of video game addiction treated by cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in practice specialized in video game addiction. Method. The therapeutic methods used came from specialized CBT techniques for video game addiction. The assessment of game behavior was partly based on protocol from previous research. A semi-directive interview addressed the type of game and modalities of the game. Average playing time per week was calculated based on morning, afternoon and evening play for each day of the week. To assess the problem a French version of problem video game playing (PVP) was used. In addition to the PVP, we created a more exhaustive questionnaire, which is currently being validated, on video game addiction (QAJV), based on different contents related to addictions. A questionnaire of 140 items, currently in the process of validation, served to assess the cognitive-emotional and behavior processes in video game use. Treatment. The case study spanned 11 months, which corresponded to 17 consultations. The first four consultations concerned analysis of game behavior, assessment of change motivation, motivational work and elaboration of a functional analysis. The patient aged 19 had been playing video games since the age of 9. The problem became apparent 3 years earlier when he decided to drop out of school. He played many different types of video games, both online and offline. The average playing time per week was 77 hours. The PVP was 7/9 and the QAJV was 187/380. The excessive game behavior met the criteria of behavior addiction. The 140-item questionnaire revealed certain expectations concerning the video game: pursuit of positive emotions, relaxation, immersion and cognitive avoidance of the negative aspects of daily life. Five consultations were necessary for the treatment centered on the video game behavior with auto-observation of game behavior and cognitive-emotional experience, support in reducing playing time, control of the stimulus, setting up alternative activities and work on the relationships. Six months into the treatment, satisfactory game control enabled the subject to enter into a phase of maintenance and relapse prevention, which corresponded to three consultations. The different situations presenting the risk of relapse were worked on. Ten months after the initial evaluation, the PVP was 0/9, the QAJV 6/380 and playing time 14. A significant social anxiety, masked by excessive game behavior and obsessions, appeared as a comorbidity during the therapy and was then eliminated. This article, based on the treatment of excessive video game behavior, does not deal in detail with the treatment of comorbidities. Conclusion. Good knowledge of the world of video games by the therapist seems to improve the therapeutic alliance in the treatment of video game addiction. This case study shows the reality of a video game player who has excessive game behavior, which resembles addiction. Without treatment focusing on the video games, it would have been impossible to effectively treat the social anxiety. The treatment of emotional and behavioral cognitive processes linked to video games was shown to be an adapted therapeutic method. The characteristics specific to video games, the motivations to play and the psychological experience of the player seem to be essential variables to take into account to maximize the efficiency of CBT applied to video game addiction. The CBT treatment described in the report was efficient in achieving control of behavior in the video game use. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - What role does emotion play in helping youth reach their creative potential? Does it alter how they process ideas, and how many ideas they can generate? By varying the levels of arousal associated with low, medium, and high levels of exertion in the video game Dance Dance Revolution, and inducing a positive or negative mood, this study offers evidence that emotion significantly affects creativity through the interaction of arousal and valence. Faced with the cognitive demand of creativity, lower arousal levels resulted in higher creativity scores when coupled with a negative mood. At high arousal levels, a positive mood resulted in greater creative potential than a negative mood. These results are discussed here in light of theories of emotion as a prime, as information, and as a moderator of attention. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The column presents an overview of CyberSightings. CyberSightings is a regular feature in CYBER that covers the news relevant to the Cyberpsychology community, including scientific breakthroughs, latest devices, conferences, book reviews, and general announcements of interest to researchers and clinicians. Biofeedback is a therapeutic technique (and technology) that is increasingly used in the fields of cybertherapy to treat several psychosomatic and psychiatric conditions. This technique is based on the use of instruments that allow measuring and feeding back to the individual information about various physiological functions that are normally outside voluntary control, such as muscolar tension, skin conductance, blood pressure, and heart rate. Beyond clinical efficacy, one of the most intriguing aspect of biofeedback is that this procedure gives the patient a central and active role in the therapeutic process. Within the biofeedback approach, the patient is required to learn how to self-regulate a specific physiological function, thus becoming more personally engaged in the clinical procedure compared to usual medical treatments. A potential advantage of this approach is that the use of biofeedback can be integrated into everyday ICT tools (i.e., laptop, mobile phone, tablet, video games), thus allowing patients to practice more frequently, although under the supervision of a certified practitioner.

AB  - Both cognitive and social-cognitive deficits impact functional outcome in schizophrenia. Cognitive remediation studies indicate that targeted cognitive and/or social-cognitive training improves behavioral performance on trained skills. However, the neural effects of training in schizophrenia and their relation to behavioral gains are largely unknown. This study tested whether a 50-h intervention which included both cognitive and social-cognitive training would influence neural mechanisms that support social ccognition. Schizophrenia participants completed a computer-based intervention of either auditory-based cognitive training (AT) plus social-cognition training (SCT) (N=11) or non-specific computer games (CG) (N=11). Assessments included a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) task of facial emotion recognition, and behavioral measures of cognition, social cognition, and functional outcome. The fMRI results showed the predicted group-by-time interaction. Results were strongest for emotion recognition of happy, surprise and fear: relative to CG participants, AT+SCT participants showed a neural activity increase in bilateral amygdala, right putamen and right medial prefrontal cortex. Across all participants, pre-to-post intervention neural activity increase in these regions predicted behavioral improvement on an independent emotion perception measure (MSCEIT: Perceiving Emotions). Among AT+SCT participants alone, neural activity increase in right amygdala predicted behavioral improvement in emotion perception. The findings indicate that combined cognition and social-cognition training improves neural systems that support social-cognition skills. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - A computer game was used to study psychophysiological reactions to emotion-relevant events. Two dimensions proposed by Scherer (1984a, 1984b) in his appraisal theory, the intrinsic pleasantness and goal conduciveness of game events, were studied in a factorial design. The relative level at which a player performed at the moment of an event was also taken into account. A total of 33 participants played the game while cardiac activity, skin conductance, skin temperature, and muscle activity as well as emotion self-reports were assessed. The self-reports indicate that game events altered levels of pride, joy, anger, and surprise. Goal conduciveness had little effect on muscle activity but was associated with significant autonomic effects, including changes to interbeat interval, pulse transit time, skin conductance, and finger temperature. The manipulation of intrinsic pleasantness had little impact on physiological responses. The results show the utility of attempting to manipulate emotion-constituent appraisals and measure their peripheral physiological signatures.

AB  - Anxiety plays an important role in social behavior. For instance, high-anxious individuals are more likely to avoid such social interactions as communicating with strangers. In this study, we investigate the impact of anxiety on social decision-making. The classic ultimatum game (UG) paradigm was utilized in concert with skin conductance recording. Behavioral results reveal that when playing as responders, high-trait anxiety (HTA) participants with lower levels of self-esteem, as well as low-trait anxiety (LTA) participants with higher levels of impulsivity, were more likely to accept human-proposed inequitable offers. In addition, the HTA participants rejected more computer-proposed inequitable offers than did LTA participants. Moreover, the skin conductance response to inequitable offers was correlated with levels of anxiety in the HTA group, but not in the LTA group. In conclusion, people differing in levels of anxiety showed distinct behavior patterns and autonomic neural responses during social decision-making, whereas the levels of self-esteem, impulsivity, and depression might be additional moderating factors. These findings contextualize high-anxious people's avoidance tendency in social interaction. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Previous research has shown that playing violent video game exposure can increase aggressive thoughts, aggressive feelings, and physiological arousal. This study compared the effects that playing a realistic violent, unrealistic violent, or nonviolent video game for 45 min has on such variables. For the purpose of this study, realism was defined as the probability of seeing an event in real life. Participants (N = 74; 39 male, 35 female) played either a realistic violent, unrealistic violent, or nonviolent video game for 45 min. Aggressive thoughts and aggressive feelings were measured four times (every 15 min), whereas arousal was measured continuously. The results showed that, though playing any violent game stimulated aggressive thoughts, playing a more realistic violent game stimulated significantly more aggressive feelings and arousal over the course of play.

AB  - This study investigated whether media interactivity would influence the short-term effects of violent content on audience aggression. The general aggression model, social cognitive theory, and character identification offered the theoretical framework. A random sample of 102 male college students were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: video game playing, recorded game-play watching, or movie watching. The results indicated that video game players (mediated enactive experience) experienced greater increases in aggressive affect, aggressive cognition, and physiological arousal than participants who watched recorded game play or comparable movie scenes (mediated observational experience). The study indicated that media interactivity in video game exacerbated the violent effect on short-term, aggressive responses. Character identification did not mediate the effect of media interactivity on aggression. Future studies should incorporate more comprehensive measures of character identification to investigate inconsistent findings regarding media interactivity and identification.

AB  - Aggressiveness attributed to violent video game play is typically studied as a function of the content features of the game. However, can interface features of the game also affect aggression? Guided by the General Aggression Model (GAM), we examine the controller type (gun replica vs. mouse) and screen size (large vs. small) as key technological aspects that may affect the state aggression of gamers, with spatial presence and arousal as potential mediators. Results from a between-subjects experiment showed that a realistic controller and a large screen display induced greater aggression, presence, and arousal than a conventional mouse and a small screen display, respectively, and confirmed that trait aggression was a significant predictor of gamers’ state aggression. Contrary to GAM, however, arousal showed no effects on aggression; instead, presence emerged as a significant mediator. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: The relation between weighting of valence information in attitude generalization and evaluation of novel/hypothetical situations was explored. Method: Undergraduate participants played a computer game requiring them to learn which stimuli (beans) would increase/decrease their points. Later, participants classified the valence of game beans and novel ones varying in resemblance to game beans. The weighting bias in attitude generalization was estimated as the average response to novel beans, controlling for game bean learning. We examined whether this bias related to judgments of hypothetical situations concerning interpersonal relationships (Study 1), threat assessment (Study 2), risk propensities (Study 3), and risk behavior (Study 6).We also assessed whether valence weighting is specifically predictive of novel situations (Studies 4 and 5). Finally,we explored participants’ ability to self-report their weighting bias (Study 7). Results: Valence weighting in attitude generalization was related to judgments of novel situations and risk behavior. The performance-based measure did not correlate with responses to various questionnaires related to valence weighting. Conclusions: There is a fundamental individual difference associated with valence weighting, resulting in the relation between two processes unrelated in content, but sharing the essential characteristic of valence weighting—attitude generalization and evaluation of novel situations.

AB  - This paper presents the LIFEisGAME prototype-Ipad version—a serious game that proposes to enhance facial and emotional recognition skills in children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). We assess the prototype game regarding motivation to play and game usability, and also participants’ emotional recognition abilities and technology usage. People with autism are less likely to gaze at faces and are also impaired in face discrimination tasks. Recently, technology plays an active role in helping these individuals to understand emotions and recognise facial expressions. LIFEisGAME prototype was played during a 15 minute game session by 11 children with ASD, with ages varying from 5-15 years old (M = 9.27, SD = 2.97), 91% were male and 9% were female, 82% were verbal ASD and 18% were non-verbal ASD. We video recorded each child and the footage was analysed according to game usability and motivation to play. Parents (n = 11) filled out a parental consent form and a questionnaire about their child´s technology usage and their emotional understanding. Therapists' opinions (n = 8) about the game were given during an unstructured interview. The game was presented on an Ipad 4 (9.7 inches, 2048 x 1536). Participants enjoyed the prototype but it still needs to be simplified. All participants had experience with computer games. Fear, disgust and surprise were the most challenging emotions to recognise. Parents suggested adding musical stimuli to promote motivation and therapists recommended to include visual game instructions. Technology is a useful resource for autism and LIFEisGAME utilises technology to promote emotional understanding, bringing positive outcomes to quality of life for children with autism.

AB  - Past research suggests the positive effects of both video game play and the benefits of peppermint scent administration. The present study assessed the combination of video game play and peppermint scent administration on physiology, mood, game performance, and task load. Participants completed a control condition with no scent administration to serve as a baseline, and were then assigned to either repeat the control condition or to complete an experimental condition in which peppermint scent was delivered via nasal cannula at 3 LPM. Participants played 3 Nintendo Wii Fit Plus games requiring cognitive and hand/eye reactions (Perfect 10, Snowball Fight, and Obstacle Course). Participants in the peppermint scent condition showed greater improvements, such as completing significantly more levels, more hits, more stars, and distance completed. Further, participants in the peppermint condition reported less mental demand, perceived effort, and anxiety. Control group participants had a significantly lower pulse change and diastolic blood pressure change, whereas, participants in the peppermint scent condition experienced no significant difference in pulse suggesting that the scent administration promoted greater physiological arousal, thus keeping them engaged in the testing process. Implications include the combination of video games and a physiologically arousing scent (specifically, peppermint) to further promote cognitive performance.

AB  - This article provides an overview of the papers presented in the issue Connection Science. This special issue contains selected papers from the 2013 Adaptive and Learning Agents (ALA) workshop, held as a satellite workshop at the Autonomous Agents and MultiAgent Systems conference (AAMAS) in St Pauls, MN, USA. The goal of the ALA workshop is to increase awareness and interest in adaptive agent research, encourage collaboration, and provide a representative overview of current research in the area of adaptive learning agents. It aims at bringing together not only different areas of computer science (e.g. agent architectures, reinforcement learning, and evolutionary algorithms), but also different fields studying similar concepts (e.g. game theory, bio-inspired control, and mechanism design). The workshop serves as an interdisciplinary forum for the discussion of ongoing or completed work in ALAs and multi-agent systems. An adaptive learning agent is capable of adapting its behaviour in order to react to changes in its environment and using previous experience to improve its performance with respect to some evaluation measure.

AB  - Objective: Digital game playing engages people for long periods of time. The pleasure offered by digital games may explain the players’ consumption of this activity. Games may elicit both positive and negative emotions, which can be measured by encephalography (EEG). The EEG alpha asymmetry index (AI) is different in positive and negative emotions and so may be used to distinguish positive from negative emotions that occur during gaming. We hypothesized that the 'Counter-Strike' (CS) game (Valve Software, Bellevue, WA) is pleasurable and demonstrable with a positive EEG AI. Subjects and Methods: Twelve male participants ages 18–30 years underwent EEG recordings continuously during and postgame. EEG was also recorded pregame for control conditions of baseline (sitting on a chair staring at a blank wall), movement (moving fingers on the computer keyboard with a blank screen), sound (listening to the sound of the CS game with a blank screen), and screen (watching the CS game without playing). Self-ratings of emotional responses were completed at pre-, during, and postgame. Results: A significant decrease in the EEG AI was observed under the screen condition compared with baseline, whereas an increase was observed postgame compared with the screen condition. The participants demonstrated a positive EEG AI following the 'shoot' events (shoot opponents) and negative emotions after the 'being shot' events. Subjective ratings of emotional response indicated happiness during and postgame, but anger and arousal were reported only during the game. Conclusions: The overall results are consistent with the hypothesis that predominantly positive emotional reactions are elicited from playing the CS game and concur with positive subjective ratings of happiness. Future studies may explore the relationship of game pleasure and obsessive game play. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The authors examined emotional valence- and arousal-related phasic psychophysiological responses to different violent events in the first-person shooter video game 'James Bond 007: NightFire' among 36 young adults. Event-related changes in zygomaticus major, corrugator supercilii, and orbicularis oculi electromyographic (EMG) activity and skin conductance level (SCL) were recorded, and the participants rated their emotions and the trait psychoticism based on the Psychoticism dimension of the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire--Revised, Short Form. Wounding and killing the opponent elicited an increase in SCL and a decrease in zygomatic and orbicularis oculi EMG activity. The decrease in zygomatic and orbicularis oculi activity was less pronounced among high Psychoticism scorers compared with low Psychoticism scorers. The wounding and death of the player's own character (James Bond) elicited an increase in SCL and zygomatic and orbicularis oculi EMG activity and a decrease in corrugator activity. Instead of joy resulting from victory and success, wounding and killing the opponent may elicit high-arousal negative affect (anxiety), with high Psychoticism scorers experiencing less anxiety than low Psychoticism scorers. Although counterintuitive, the wounding and death of the player's own character may increase some aspect of positive emotion. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - It is well known that violent video games increase aggression, and that stress increases aggression. Many violent video games can be stressful because enemies are trying to kill players. The present study investigates whether violent games increase aggression by inducing stress in players. Stress was measured using cardiac coherence, defined as the synchronization of the rhythm of breathing to the rhythm of the heart. We predicted that cardiac coherence would mediate the link between exposure to violent video games and subsequent aggression. Specifically, we predicted that playing a violent video game would decrease cardiac coherence, and that cardiac coherence, in turn, would correlate negatively with aggression. Participants (N = 77) played a violent or nonviolent video game for 20 min. Cardiac coherence was measured before and during game play. After game play, participants had the opportunity to blast a confederate with loud noise through headphones during a reaction time task. The intensity and duration of noise blasts given to the confederate was used to measure aggression. As expected, violent video game players had lower cardiac coherence levels and higher aggression levels than did nonviolent game players. Cardiac coherence, in turn, was negatively related to aggression. This research offers another possible reason why violent games can increase aggression—by inducing stress. Cardiac coherence can be a useful tool to measure stress induced by violent video games. Cardiac coherence has several desirable methodological features as well: it is noninvasive, stable against environmental disturbances, relatively inexpensive, not subject to demand characteristics, and easy to use.

AB  - This study suggests that fighting against different types of opponents in video games (e.g., human opponents vs. monster opponents) may lead to different emotional responses and moral judgments toward game characters. Based on Bandura’s moral disengagement theory, this study proposes that shooting at monster opponents makes game players feel less guilty and judge the player-controlled character as more morally justified. An experiment was conducted in which participants played shooting games with either human opponents or monster opponents. The results show that when playing against monster opponents, participants felt both less ashamed and less guilty, reported enjoying the game more, and judged their character as more justified than participants who played against human opponents.

AB  - A new measure of individual habits and preferences in video game use is developed in order to better study the risk factors of pathological game use (i.e., excessively frequent or prolonged use, sometimes called 'game addiction'). This measure was distributed to internet message boards for game enthusiasts and to college undergraduates. An exploratory factor analysis identified 9 factors: Story, Violent Catharsis, Violent Reward, Social Interaction, Escapism, Loss-Sensitivity, Customization, Grinding, and Autonomy. These factors demonstrated excellent fit in a subsequent confirmatory factor analysis, and, importantly, were found to reliably discriminate between inter-individual game preferences (e.g., Super Mario Brothers as compared to Call of Duty). Moreover, three factors were significantly related to pathological game use: the use of games to escape daily life, the use of games as a social outlet, and positive attitudes toward the steady accumulation of in-game rewards. The current research identifies individual preferences and motives relevant to understanding video game players’ evaluations of different games and risk factors for pathological video game use.

AB  - Despite a rising social relevance of pathological computer game playing, it remains unclear whether the neurobiological basis of this addiction-like behavioral disorder and substance-related addiction are comparable. In substance-related addiction, attentional bias and cue reactivity are often observed. We conducted a functional magnetic resonance study using a dot probe paradigm with short-presentation (attentional bias) and long-presentation (cue reactivity) trials in eight male pathological computer game players (PCGPs) and nine healthy controls (HCs). Computer game-related and neutral computer-generated pictures, as well as pictures from the International Affective Picture System with positive and neutral valence, served as stimuli. PCGPs showed an attentional bias toward both game-related and affective stimuli with positive valence. In contrast, HCs showed no attentional bias effect at all. PCGPs showed stronger brain responses in short-presentation trials compared with HCs in medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and anterior cingulate gyrus and in long-presentation trials in lingual gyrus. In an exploratory post hoc functional connectivity analyses, for long-presentation trials, connectivity strength was higher between right inferior frontal gyrus, which was associated with inhibition processing in previous studies, and cue reactivity-related regions (left orbitofrontal cortex and ventral striatum) in PCGPs. We observed behavioral and neural effects in PCGPs, which are comparable with those found in substance-related addiction. However, cue-related brain responses were depending on duration of cue presentation. Together with the connectivity result, these findings suggest that top-down inhibitory processes might suppress the cue reactivity-related neural activity in long-presentation trials.

AB  - This paper reviews the result of researches on the effects of media violence on youths and tries to relate these to the increased exhibition violence among Nigerian youths. These research results reveal unequivocal evidence that media violence increases the likelihood of the incidence of aggressive and violent behavior on both immediate and long term contexts. Longitudinal studies have provided converging evidence linking frequent exposure to violent media in child hood with aggressive later in life. Characteristics of viewers, social environments and media content, were identified as factors that influence the degree to which media violence affects aggression. Research findings further suggest that no one is wholly immune to the effects of media violence. Interactive media, such as video games and the internet, have been shown to be more potent in affecting individuals. Studies on the effects of violent video games have shown that they cause increases in aggressive thoughts, effect and behavior in physiological arousal. The paper concludes that youth violent behaviours seem to be increasing in form, as the violent content of media increases inform and diversity. The world has become a global village, so there is a need to monitor the media forms allowed into our nation, and to monitor what youths are exposed to. A lot of violent acts are in already taking place in our society, especially in institutions of higher learning, and youths are involved in most causes. It is time to take a serious look at youth violence and the enormous violent content and form of the Nigerian media. The paper recommends, among other things, that the mass media should be censored more seriously. Age limits should be clearly indicated on media programmes sold in the market. Parents, teachers and care givers and even youths should be educated on the harm done by consuming large doses of violent media content. Research should be done to investigate the relationship between media violence and the violent behaviour of Nigerian youths. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Reviews the video game, Papo and Yo by Vander Caballero (2012). Papo and Yo is game based on Vander Caballero’s exorcism of his childhood demons: a magical realist video game about a boy named Quico and his monster. The game’s puzzles use environmental elements of the favela to further Quico and Monster’s progress. The tasks become more difficult as you go, but this is a puzzle-based game, and there is little other resistance to your progress. The puzzles are not overly challenging, perhaps because, rather than the game play, the story itself is your motivation to continue. Living in his imagination, the game’s magical realist setting is Quico’s way of exerting control over his environment as he searches for a way to cope with the turbulent emotions and constant threat of his father’s unpredictable attacks. Gradually, as Quico works his way through the puzzles and his own emotional barriers, the real world resurfaces, but the progressive transformations in his physical appearance never reverse. Papo and Yo is a game about childhood, but probably not a game for children. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Although trust and reciprocity are ubiquitous in social exchange, their neurobiological substrate remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated the effect of damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC)—a brain region critical for valuing social information—on individuals' decisions in a trust game and in a risk game. In the trust game, one player, the investor, is endowed with a sum of money, which she can keep or invest. The amount she decides to invest is tripled and sent to the other player, the trustee, who then decides what fraction to return to the investor. In separate runs, ten patients with focal bilateral damage to the vmPFC and control participants made decision while playing in the role of either investor or trustee with different anonymous counterparts in each run. A risk game was also included in which the investor faced exactly the same decisions as in the trust game, but a random device (i.e., a computer), not another player, determined the final payoffs. Results showed that vmPFC patients’ investments were not modulated by the type of opponent player (e.g., human vs. computer) present in the environment. Thus, vmPFC patients showed comparable risktaking preferences both in social (trust game) and nonsocial (risk game) contexts. In stark contrast, control participants were less willing to take risk and invest when they believed that they were interacting with people than a computer. Furthermore, when acted as trustee, vmPFC patients made lower back transfers toward investors, thereby showing less reciprocity behavior. Taken together, these results indicate that social valuation and emotion subserved by vmPFC have a critical role in trusting and reciprocity decisions. The present findings support the hypothesis that vmPFC damage may impair affective systems specifically designed for mediating social transaction with other individuals.

AB  - The training of tactical decision making increasingly occurs through serious computer games. A challenging aspect of designing such games is the modelling of human emotions. Two studies were performed to investigate the relation between fidelity and human emotion recognition in virtual human characters. Study 1 compared five versions of a virtual character that expressed emotions through different combinations of posture, facial expression, and tone of voice. Results showed that emotion recognition was best when all three behavioural cues were present; posture + face and posture + tone of voice were joint second best. In study 2, these three versions were supplemented with contextual information. Cross-variant comparisons yielded marginal differences in emotion recognition and no differences in tactical decision making. Together, these findings suggest that the combination of posture with either facial expression or tone of voice is sufficient to ensure recognition of human emotions in tactical decision-making games.

AB  - Video games constitute a popular form of entertainment that allows millions of people to adopt virtual identities. In our research, we explored the idea that the appeal of games is due in part to their ability to provide players with novel experiences that let them 'try on' ideal aspects of their selves that might not find expression in everyday life. We found that video games were most intrinsically motivating and had the greatest influence on emotions when players’ experiences of themselves during play were congruent with players’ conceptions of their ideal selves. Additionally, we found that high levels of immersion in gaming environments, as well as large discrepancies between players’ actual-self and ideal-self characteristics, magnified the link between intrinsic motivation and the experience of ideal-self characteristics during play.

AB  - Major advances in multimedia computer technology over the past decades have made sophisticated computer games readily available to the public. This, combined with the observation that most children, including those with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), show an affinity to computers, has led researchers to recognize the potential of computer technology as an effective and efficient tool in research and treatment. This paper reviews the use of computer-assisted technology (CAT), excluding strictly internet-based approaches, to enhance social, communicative, and language development in individuals with ASD by dividing the vast literature into four main areas: language, emotion recognition, theory of mind, and social skills. Although many studies illustrate the tremendous promise of CAT to enhance skills of individuals with ASD, most lack rigorous, scientific assessment of efficacy relative to non-CAT approaches.

AB  - This article discusses a game theory test which exposes the neuronal circuits for social interactions in the brains of monkeys. Neurobiologists zoomed in on neural circuits in rhesus macaques by implanting electrode arrays into a brain area called the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), which is associated with rewards and decision-making. When the monkeys played the prisoner's dilemma ('A juicy experiment') against a computer program, they rarely chose to cooperate. As the monkey made its decision, a specific set of dACC neurons tended to fire if the animal was choosing to cooperate, allowing the researchers to predict its decision two-thirds of the time. Researchers have long known about mirror neurons, which are involved in copying other individual's actions, but this is the first discovery of neurons that predict another individual's unknown actions. The researchers also found that when they interfered with the cooperation circuit by delivering an electric shock to the area, the monkeys became less likely to cooperate—suggesting that the circuits for social interaction normally override an inherent desire to self-indulge. A closer look at the circuits could reveal how they respond to hormones or drugs. Watching the response of neural circuits in monkeys is a good way to work out how much stimulation or hormone should be applied, and where.

AB  - We examined if cardiovascular and affective responding to video game play changed across social context or with game content. Male participants (13–22 years old) played a violent or nonviolent video game. Each participant played the game individually, competitively against a male partner, and cooperatively with the partner. There was no effect of social condition on heart rate (HR) or diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Participants had significantly higher systolic BP (SBP) when playing individually and competitively than when playing cooperatively, probably because play was more continuous. There was no impact of game type for HR or SBP. DBP was significantly higher for participants who played the violent game, perhaps because participants found the violent game more exciting and enjoyable. Participants who played the violent game rated the experimenters more positively than those who played the nonviolent game. Participants found game play more exciting, enjoyable, stressful, and frustrating, but less boring and relaxing, when they played competitively or cooperatively than when they played individually. The results are discussed in terms of the general aggression model. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Introduces a special issue on Adaptive Learning Agents. An Adaptive Learning Agent is capable of adapting its behaviour in order to react to changes in its environment and using previous experience to improve its performance with respect to some evaluation measure. The community of Adaptive Learning Agents studies systems that are capable of acting autonomously and adapting to their surroundings. This special issue contains selected papers from the 2013 Adaptive and Learning Agents (ALA) workshop, held as a satellite workshop at the Autonomous Agents and MultiAgent Systems conference in St Pauls, MN, USA. The goal of the ALA workshop is to increase awareness and interest in adaptive agent research, encourage collaboration, and provide a representative overview of current research in the area of Adaptive Learning Agents. It aims at bringing together not only different areas of computer science (e.g. agent architectures, reinforcement learning, and evolutionary algorithms), but also different fields studying similar concepts (e.g. game theory, bio-inspired control, and mechanism design). The workshop serves as an interdisciplinary forum for the discussion of ongoing or completed work in ALA and multiagent systems. This special issue contains five carefully selected papers. All papers were presented at the ALA 2013 workshop and were thoroughly reviewed and revised over two separate review rounds. The result provides an excellent overview of the current research directions and state-of-the-art within the adaptive learning agent community.

AB  - Two studies examined the effects of different socio-affective factors on risk driving behaviour. In Experiment 1, 87 adult drivers we asked to play a computer-based driving game after being exposed to a series of images that depicted infants, police or neutral information (control condition). In Experiment 2 we tested a further 60 adult drivers. We found a significant effect of our manipulation on driving behaviour, with performance being significantly less risky in the infant condition than in the police and control conditions. In addition, this advantage was not simply due to variations in emotions typically associated with infant pictures. The results of this study highlight the importance of studying the role of socio-affective context when investigating factors that influence driving behaviour.

AB  - In this paper, we present an initial study to determine the subject preferences for educational computer games for children, in which 150 education professionals participated. From the results of this first study, we have developed an iPhone game for transmitting knowledge as part of multiculturalism, solidarity and tolerance following established learning theories, several design principles, and the objectives and competences of the Spanish law for primary education. We also report on a second study to determine whether the iPhone game has better learning outcomes than a traditional game by analyzing the participation of 84 children ranging in age from 8 to 10 years old. The frequency of playing with consoles or computer games was also taken into account in this second study, and the worldwide trend of previous studies has been corroborated. For learning outcomes, the results did not show significant differences between the two groups. However, 96% of the children indicated that they would like to play with the iPhone game again, and 90% indicated that they preferred the experience with the iPhone game over the traditional one. From these results, we can conclude that the children achieved similar knowledge improvements using both the autonomous game (iPhone game) and the custom, guided game (traditional game). This could facilitate versatility in the learning process since the learning activity could be performed at any place and time without requiring supervision. Therefore, it could be a useful tool in the learning process and help teachers to fulfill students’ training needs. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Computer-based surgical training simulators are instrumental in skill-based training and performance measurement. However, to date, the educational employment of these tools lacks empirically founded insights and effective practical guidelines. This study examined surgical residents during computer-based simulator training of basic laparoscopic surgical skills. The quantitative analysis of residents’ performance averages from training onset to completion produced mixed results, revealing skill improvements as well as decreases, depending on the parameter. The results obtained from the simulator parameters and questionnaires showed that residents with either prior laparoscopic experience or gaming experience significantly outperformed their colleagues. Based on feedback and video-recorded performance analysis, the study concluded that autonomous training with the simulator is not sufficient for developing a minimum standard of performance. Residents need an adequate level of content-based feedback and supervisor support during training. We advise a more detailed and pedagogically informative measurement and feedback system, including specialist-instructor guidance, be developed.

AB  - Differences in physiological, physical, and technical demands of small-sided basketball games related to the number of players, court size, and work-to-rest ratios are not well characterised. A controlled trial was conducted to compare the influence of number of players (2v2/4v4), court size (half/full court) and work-to-rest ratios (4x2.5 min/2x5 min) on the demands of small-sided games. Sixteen elite male and female junior players (aged 15–19 years) completed eight variations of a small-sided game in randomised order over a six-week period. Heart rate responses and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) were measured to assess the physiological load. Movement patterns and technical elements were assessed by video analysis. There were ∼ 60% more technical elements in 2v2 and ∼ 20% more in half court games. Heart rate (86 ± 4% & 83 ± 5% of maximum; mean ± SD) and RPE (8 ± 2 & 6 ± 2; scale 1–10) were moderately higher in 2v2 than 4v4 small-sided games, respectively. The 2v2 format elicited substantially more sprints (36 ± 12%; mean ± 90% confidence limits) and high intensity shuffling (75 ± 17%) than 4v4. Full court games required substantially more jogging (9 ± 6%) compared to half court games. Fewer players in small-sided basketball games substantially increases the technical, physiological and physical demands. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Few studies have examined the impact of prior video gaming experience on the stress experienced while immersed in a virtual environment. Our hypothesis was that prior experience with immersive video games could reduce the stressful impact of a virtual environment. We compared emotions in gamers and non-gamers after an immersion in a 3-D environment designed to induce fear. Our results show that the level of fear in people who consider themselves as non-gamers is higher than in gamers. The conclusion addresses the role of presence as a contributing factor.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of the presence or absence (control) of a partition board and its color (red, yellow, blue) on subjective mood ratings and changes in autonomic nervous system indicators induced by a video game task. The increase in the mean Profile of Mood States (POMS) Fatigue score and mean Oppressive feeling rating after the task was lowest with the blue partition board. Multiple-regression analysis identified oppressive feeling and error scores on the second half of the task as statistically significant contributors to Fatigue While explanatory variables were limited to the physiological indices, multiple-regression analysis identified a significant contribution of autonomic reactivity (assessed by heart rate variability) to Fatigue. These results suggest that a blue partition board would reduce task-induced subjective fatigue, in part by lowering the oppressive feeling of being enclosed during the task, possibly by increasing autonomic reactivity.

AB  - The authors added task-relevant sounds to a computer-mediated instructor in-the-loop virtual training for firefighter commanders in an attempt to raise the engagement and arousal of the users. Computer-mediated training for crew commanders should provide a sensory experience that is sufficiently intense to make the training viable and effective. In practice, sound is an important source of information for firefighters. During an evaluation of a soundless computer-mediated and instructor in-the-loop virtual training, both trainees and instructors frequently remarked that the lack of sound made the simulation less convincing and engaging. Research on entertainment games has shown that users may experience higher levels of presence, engagement, and arousal when sound is included in the simulations. The authors therefore hypothesized that the addition of task-relevant (informative) sounds to a virtual training would raise the engagement and arousal of the users, and the overall convincingness of the simulation. In this study, they included verisimilar and task-relevant sounds in an instructor in-the-loop computer-mediated firefighter training and assessed how these sounds affect user experience. In contrast to the common belief of trainees and instructors, the authors find that merely adding task-relevant sounds does not necessarily increase the engagement and arousal of the users. The authors conclude that the physical presence of (and verbal communication with) the instructor probably distracted from the simulation, and an integral sound design involving mediated communication with a remotely present instructor may be required to resolve this problem.

AB  - Most early research on entertainment defines media enjoyment in functional terms as the satisfaction of hedonic needs. Two studies demonstrate the value of including nonhedonic and hedonic need satisfaction in defining enjoyment. Both studies find support for a need‐satisfaction model showing that hedonic (arousal and affect) and nonhedonic (competence and autonomy) need satisfaction account for unique variance in enjoyment experienced during video game play. Study 2 extends the findings of Study 1 to account for noninteractive media entertainment enjoyment. Results show hedonic and nonhedonic need satisfaction to be distinct but complementary components of media enjoyment. Discussion focuses on the advantage of a needs‐based approach for understanding positive valuations of media and offers a new perspective on the enjoyment–appreciation distinction.

AB  - Playing entertainment computer, video, and portable games, namely, digital games, is receiving more and more attention in academic research. Games are studied in different situations with numerous methods, but little is known about if and how the playing situation affects the user experience (UX) in games. In addition, it is hard to understand and study the psychology of UX in games. The objective of this study is to show how UX differs when the first-person shooter HALO is played in a laboratory and at home. To disclose this difference, a psychologically valid and multidimensional measurement framework is introduced. UX is profiled according to the level of the sense of presence, involvement, and flow in a between-subjects design. Statistically, the structure of the framework is grounded on a large and heterogeneous gamer data set (N = 2,182). The results showed that the profile of the sense of presence in the laboratory included higher levels of attention and arousal as compared with that of the natural environment. This finding was independent of any of the measured background variables. Other differences between the two situations were more related to the participants’ background. For example, gamers at home were more involved in the game and they felt a higher level of competence. No strong emotional differences between the two situations were found. The authors discuss the complex UX terminology and implications of the framework for implementation of learning games. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Individuals collaborating around and through computers benefit from receiving information that helps them understand one another, which is often termed awareness. This article explores what collaborators understand about each other’s emotions and the potential benefits for performance that might come from raising this understanding. In Experiment 1 co-located collaborators judged each other’s emotions after playing a game that required cooperative data collection and analysis. Their judgements were largely inaccurate and based on their own emotions, suggesting limited emotion understanding. Experiment 2 explored if this could be overcome by making collaborators aware of each other’s emotions. Co-located and remote collaborators played a cooperative puzzle-solving game under conditions of awareness or no awareness. Awareness was manipulated by making collaborators share their self-reported emotions during key moments of their game play. Both remote and co-located collaborators improved their performance after sharing their emotions. However, unlike co-located collaborators, remote collaborators also improved their understanding of each other’s emotions and experienced more positive affect. We conclude by discussing the content of collaborators’ emotion understanding and the probable mechanisms underlying the observed effects of being made aware of a partner’s emotions.

Autumn is a season of shedding, symbolized by leaves falling from trees from transitioning to cold winter, which will make room to grow new leaves in the warm spring. This issue focuses on negative behaviors, judgments, and emotions associated with video games, music, social media, obesity, and psychological stigma that might be shed in order to make a positive paradigm shift.

AB  - We tested the effects of different post-match recovery interventions on the subsequent hormonal responses to a physical stress-test and game performance in professional rugby union players. On four occasions, participants (n = 12) completed a video session (1 h each) with accompanying coach feedback the day after a rugby union match. The interventions showed either video footage of player mistakes with negative coach feedback (NCF1) or player successes with positive feedback (PCF1). Both approaches were repeated (NCF2 and PCF2). In the following week, participants were assessed for their free testosterone (T) and cortisol (C) responses to a physical stress-test, pre-game T and game-ranked performance. The PFC1 and PCF2 approaches were both associated with significantly (p < 0.01) greater free T (36% to 42%) responses to the stress-test when compared to NCF1 and NCF2 (16% to −3%), respectively. The PCF interventions were also associated with higher (28% to 51%) pre-game T concentrations and superior game-ranked performances than the NCF approaches (p < 0.01). In conclusion, the post-game presentation of specific video footage combined with different coach feedbacks appeared to influence the free hormonal state of rugby players and game performance several days later. Therefore, within the sporting context, future behaviour and performance might be modified through the use of simple psychological strategies. These data are applicable to generalised human stress responses and their modifiability by prior exposure to a stressor. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Reports an error in 'Are there optimal levels of arousal to memory? Effects of arousal, centrality, and familiarity on brand memory in video games' by Eui Jun Jeong and Frank A. Biocca (Computers in Human Behavior, 2012[Mar], Vol 28[2], 285-291). In the original article, the affiliation is incorrectly listed for Eui Jun Jeong. The correct affiliation is present in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2012-00508-002[/rid]). Using a modified first-person shooter game, Counter Strike 2, this study tested (1) if the Yerkes–Dodson law could be applied to the relationship between physiological arousal (skin conductance) and brand memory in the new interactive technology setting; (2) if central and familiar ads are better recognized; and (3) if there are any interaction effects among arousal, centrality, and familiarity on brand memory. A pre-test was conducted to estimate the cut-off points of arousal into three levels (low, medium, and high) in the identical setting. Through within-subject analysis, a total of 550 cases were categorized into the three levels of arousal and analyzed. The results showed the highest recognition scores at the medium level of arousal, and no significant difference between the medium and high levels of arousal in brand memory. The participants remembered better centrally located brands than peripheral brands. Familiarity also had a positive relationship with the levels of arousal. Particularly, the recognition scores for centrally located brands increased with the levels of arousal, but no difference was found for peripheral brands. Findings and implications were discussed.

AB  - This study attempted to (a) extend traditional mood management theory research by investigating the influence of the intrinsic needs for competence and autonomy on selective exposure to video games and (b) test the influence of satisfying these needs on resultant mood repair. An experiment varied satisfaction of competence and autonomy needs using false feedback. Subjects then selected media that varied in level of user demand. Measures of need satisfaction were taken before and after media selection. Results demonstrated that (a) thwarted intrinsic needs significantly predict the choice of video games with different levels of user demand and (b) the satisfaction of these needs predicts enjoyment. Findings indicate that mood management can result from mood repair through need satisfaction. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Empirical studies have validated that basic needs satisfaction supported by video game play predicts motivation and engagement outcomes. However, few studies specifically manipulated game features for each of the three basic needs specified in the self-determination theory (SDT) to examine how the game features impact players' need satisfaction and game experience. The current study employed an in-house developed exergame and manipulated the game features in a 2 (autonomy-supportive game features: on vs. off) × 2 (competence-supportive game features: on vs. off) experiment to predict need satisfaction, game enjoyment, motivation for future play, effort for gameplay, self-efficacy for exercise using the game, likelihood of game recommendation, and game rating. The manipulated game features led to the corresponding need satisfaction. Manipulated autonomy-supportive and competence-supportive game features had main effects on most motivation and engagement outcomes. Need satisfaction of autonomy and need satisfaction of competence were both found to be mediators for the relationships between the game features and the motivation and engagement outcomes. The findings add evidence to support the underlying mechanism postulated by SDT for media enjoyment and motivation as well as the emerging entertainment research conceptualizing enjoyment as need satisfaction. The findings also have practical implications for intervention effort that intends to capitalize the motivational pull of video games. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Approximately 300,000 people suffer sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) annually in the United States. Less than 30% of out-of-hospital victims receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) despite the American Heart Association training over 12 million laypersons annually to conduct CPR. New engaging learning methods are needed for CPR education, especially in schools. Massively multiplayer virtual worlds (MMVW) offer platforms for serious games that are promising learning methods that take advantage of the computer capabilities of today’s youth (ie, the digital native generation). Objective: Our main aim was to assess the feasibility of cardiopulmonary resuscitation training in high school students by using avatars in MMVM. We also analyzed experiences, self-efficacy, and concentration in response to training. Methods: In this prospective international collaborative study, an e-learning method was used with high school students in Sweden and the United States. A software game platform was modified for use as a serious game to train in emergency medical situations. Using MMVW technology, participants in teams of 3 were engaged in virtual-world scenarios to learn how to treat victims suffering cardiac arrest. Short debriefings were carried out after each scenario. A total of 36 high school students (Sweden, n = 12; United States, n = 24) participated. Their self-efficacy and concentration (task motivation) were assessed. An exit questionnaire was used to solicit experiences and attitudes toward this type of training. Among the Swedish students, a follow-up was carried out after 6 months. Depending on the distributions, t tests or Mann-Whitney tests were used. Correlation between variables was assessed by using Spearman rank correlation. Regression analyses were used for time-dependent variables. Results: The participants enjoyed the training and reported a self-perceived benefit as a consequence of training. The mean rating for self-efficacy increased from 5.8/7 (SD 0.72) to 6.5/7 (SD 0.57, P < .001). In the Swedish follow-up, it subsequently increased from 5.7/7 (SD 0.56) to 6.3/7 (SD 0.38, P = .006). In the Swedish group, the mean concentration value increased from 52.4/100 (SD 9.8) to 62.7/100 (SD 8.9, P = .05); in the US group, the concentration value increased from 70.8/100 (SD 7.9) to 82.5/100 (SD 4.7, P < .001). We found a significant positive correlation (P < .001) between self-efficacy and concentration scores. Overall, the participants were moderately or highly immersed and the software was easy to use. Conclusions: By using online MMVWs, team training in CPR is feasible and reliable for this international group of high school students (Sweden and United States). A high level of appreciation was reported among these adolescents and their self-efficacy increased significantly. The described training is a novel and interesting way to learn CPR teamwork, and in the future could be combined with psychomotor skills training.

AB  - We examined the effect of different pre-match motivational interventions on athlete free testosterone (T) and cortisol (C) concentrations and subsequent match performance in professional rugby union. Male participants (n = 12) playing at a senior or academy level in rugby union were recruited and each completed three interventions (15 min each) before a competitive game; 1) watching a video clip of successful skill execution by the player with positive coach feedback [VPCF1]; 2) watching a video clip of successful skill execution by an opposing player with cautionary coach feedback [VCCF], 3) the player left alone to self-motivate [SM1]. The first and last interventions were retested [VPCF2 and SM2]. Salivary free T and C measures were taken pre-intervention and pre-game. Within each game, players were rated by coaching staff on a key performance indicator (KPI) from identified skills and an overall performance indicator (OPI), where 1 = best performance to 5 = worst performance. The VPCF1 and VPCF2 interventions both promoted significant T responses (11.8% to 12.5%) before each game and more so than SM1, SM2 and VCCF. The VCCF approach produced the largest C response (17.6%) and this differed from all other treatments. The VPCF interventions were also associated with better game KPI (1.5 to 1.8) and OPI ratings (1.7 to 1.8) than SM1, SM2 and/or VCCF. Across all treatments, greater individual T responses and lower C responses were associated with better KPI and OPI outcomes. In conclusion, the pre-game presentation of motivational strategies to athletes involving specific video footage and coach feedback produced different outcomes on two indicators of match performance, which were also associated with changes in free hormonal state.

AB  - Reviews the book, Games of Empire: Global Capitalism and Video Games by Nick Dyer-Witheford and Greig de Peuter (2009). The book looks at the history and structure of the games industry through a theoretical lens shaped by autonomist Marxism and poststructuralist radicalism. The book combines macro, meso and micro perspectives by applying the refined theory of empire to the video games industry in general, individual companies and hardware products, specific games and player practices. While the overall structure of the book is well thought out, some of the chapters could have been replaced by more fitting examples. Despite some shortcomings, the book is a highly relevant and generally well written introduction into the role of digital games in the system of global capitalism. The somewhat frayed end of the book shows that there is much more to explore around the subject of global capitalism and digital games. While the book is an ambitious and interesting start, a follow up is not only an option, but almost mandatory considering the multiple lines of recent developments in the games industry from free to play and micropayment business models to the success of indie games such as minecraft or the ongoing replacement of the boxed products market by digital distribution.

AB  - We examined emotional valence- and arousal-related phasic psychophysiological responses to different video game events among 36 young adults who played Super Monkey Ball 2 (Sega Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). Event-related changes in zygomatics major, corrugator supercilii, and orbicularis oculi electromyographic activity, skin conductance level, and cardiac interbeat intervals were recorded. Instantaneous game events elicited reliable psychophysiological responses indexing valence and arousal. A largely linear, positive dose-response relationship between rewards obtained in the game and phasic increases in arousal was revealed. The valence of the emotional response varied as a function of the player's active participation (active coping). In addition, not only positive events, but also some putatively negative events elicited positively valenced arousal. The findings extend our understanding of the phasic changes in the emotional state during video games and a dynamic flow of events and action and may have several applied implications (e.g., for game design).

AB  - Swearing produces a pain lessening (hypoalgesic) effect for many people; an emotional response may be the underlying mechanism. In this paper, the role of manipulated state aggression on pain tolerance and pain perception is assessed. In a repeated-measures design, pain outcomes were assessed in participants asked to play for 10 minutes a first-person shooter video game vs a golf video game. Sex differences were explored. After playing the first-person shooter video game, aggressive cognitions, aggressive affect, heart rate, and cold pressor latency were increased, and pain perception was decreased. These data indicate that people become more pain tolerant with raised state aggression and support our theory that raised pain tolerance from swearing occurs via an emotional response.

AB  - Individuals who have a more adverse reaction to stressful situations are at heightened risk for developing emotional disorders. The current studies aimed to demonstrate that valence biases in attitude generalization relate to individuals' emotional reactivity following a stressful task. Participants played a computer game in which they had to learn whether previously unknown stimuli (i.e., beans) produced positive or negative outcomes. They then had to classify novel stimuli, which varied in resemblance to those employed in the game, as either positive or negative. Attitude generalization, i.e., the extent to which participants weight resemblance to a positive versus negative, is critical to the classification of these novel stimuli, which provided the basis for indexing valence weighting. Participants then completed a stressful anagram task, in which they had three minutes to solve as many anagrams as possible. Half the anagrams were difficult, and half were insoluble, thus creating a failure experience. Mood was assessed before and after the task as a measure of emotional reactivity. In two studies, we observed that for participants initially in a good mood, the extent to which negative attitudes generalized more extensively than positive attitudes was predictive of greater emotional reactivity to the stressful anagram task.

AB  - The video game industry is a very active economic sector focusing on the design and development of entertainment applications. In this sector, different enterprises compete to design innovative video games that exploit physical and emotional capabilities of video gamers in order to achieve high levels of realism. From this point of view, video games research should be enhanced by introducing: (1) novel methodologies for modeling emotions that depict the behaviour of different characters populating a virtual environment, and (2) some abstraction technologies useful to 'move' this emotional intelligence on different game platforms without additional efforts. In this paper, innovative computational intelligence techniques, like the Timed Automata based Fuzzy Controllers, have been hybridized with emotional representation methodologies in order to provide game bots with human-like capabilities and, as a consequence, improve the realism of game under design. In order to allow different competitors to exploit our 'emotional engine' on different hardware platforms, the Fuzzy Markup Language (FML) has been chosen to be the main technology for designing and implementing the bots behaviour. As shown in a case study based on Unreal Tournament 2004, the game bots exploiting our approach provide a more human-likeness behaviour if compared with simple finite state automaton based bots.

AB  - We study how pairs of children interact socially and express their emotions while playing games in different communicative settings. In particular, we study how such interactions can vary for environments that differ regarding the level of mediation and the associated feelings of social presence. Overall, the study compared three conditions (one face-to-face gameplay condition, and two video-mediated gameplay conditions; one allowing for mutual gaze, the other not) and focused on the social presence and non-verbal behavior of children in three conditions. The results show that the presence of mutual eye-gaze enriches the feelings of social presence, fun and game experience; conversely, the absence of mutual eye-gaze dramatically effects the quality of interaction in the video-mediated environment. The results of this study stress the importance of mutual gaze, and we therefore argue that it should become an integral component of future VMC systems, particularly in those designed for playful settings and children.

AB  - Video games are an exciting part of new media. Although game play has been intensively studied, the underlying neurobiology is still poorly understood. Flow theory is a well-established model developed to describe subjective game experience. In 13 healthy male subjects, we acquired fMRI data during free play of a video game and analyzed brain activity based on the game content. In accordance with flow theory, we extracted the following factors from the game content: (i) balance between ability and challenge; (ii) concentration and focus; (iii) direct feedback of action results; (iv) clear goals; and (v) control over the situation/activity. We suggest that flow is characterized by specific neural activation patterns and that the latter can be assessed—at least partially—by content factors contributing to the emergence of flow. Each of the content factors was characterized by specific and distinguishable brain activation patterns, encompassing reward-related midbrain structures, as well as cognitive and sensorimotor networks. The activation of sensory and motor networks in the conjunction analyses underpinned the central role of simulation for flow experience. Flow factors can be validated with functional brain imaging which can improve the understanding of human emotions and motivational processes during media entertainment.

AB  - This paper reports a study designed to investigate whether playing violent video games elicits the psychological conditions theoretically required for media use to cause aggressive behavior. Specifically, the study was designed to examine whether these games elicit desensitization, facilitation, and disinhibition. Thus, does physiological arousal in response to violent activity decrease over time during game play, and is there a difference between novice and experienced game players (as would be expected if desensitization had occurred)? Do players experience positive emotional states when actively engaged in virtual violent behavior (fighting and killing opponents) – a necessary condition for disinhibition? Do game players frame their motivations in terms of self-defense and game success, as would be necessary for facilitation to occur? The results showed that playing first-person shooters did elicit these requisite patterns of cognitive, physiological, and emotional states. Violent game play is a positive, arousing, present, dominant experience, as required for disinhibition and facilitation. Experienced game players are less aroused than less experienced game players (as required for desensitization). Further, during a game-playing session, exploring and searching for enemies become less arousing, while fighting and killing become more arousing over time (as required by desensitization and facilitation).

AB  - Although numerous experiments have shown that exposure to violent video games (VVG) causes increases in aggression, relatively few studies have investigated the extent to which this effect differs as a function of theoretically relevant individual difference factors. This study investigated whether video game content differentially influences aggression as a function of individual differences in trait anger. Participants were randomly assigned to play a violent or nonviolent video game before completing a task in which they could behave aggressively. Results showed that participants high in trait anger were the most aggressive, but only if they first played a VVG. This relationship held while statistically controlling for dimensions other than violent content on which game conditions differed (e.g. frustration, arousal). Implications of these findings for models explaining the effects of video games on behavior are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study assessed the efficacy of using visual and auditory biofeedback while immersed in a tridimensional videogame to practice a stress management skill (tactical breathing). All 41 participants were soldiers who had previously received basic stress management training and first aid training in combat. On the first day, they received a 15-minute refresher briefing and were randomly assigned to either: (a) no additional stress management training (SMT) for three days, or (b) 30-minute sessions (one per day for three days) of biofeedback-assisted SMT while immersed in a horror/first-person shooter game. The training was performed in a dark and enclosed environment using a 50-inch television with active stereoscopic display and loudspeakers. On the last day, all participants underwent a live simulated ambush with an improvised explosive device, where they had to provide first aid to a wounded soldier. Stress levels were measured with salivary cortisol collected when waking-up, before and after the live simulation. Stress was also measured with heart rate at baseline, during an apprehension phase, and during the live simulation. Repeated-measure ANOVAs and ANCOVAs confirmed that practicing SMT was effective in reducing stress. Results are discussed in terms of the advantages of the proposed program for military personnel and the need to practice SMT. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Computer scientists working on Artificial Intelligence have recognized the importance of believable characters. Studies on character believability have been relatively rare and believability has different meanings in different disciplines. A multi-disciplinary literature review explores various qualities of computer characters. Different scholars and practitioners have described different believability attributes such as emotion, personality, appearance, goal and social relation. For the test of those five attributes, eight Non-Player Characters (NPCs) were chosen for the study based on game quality (high and low Metacritic scores) and diegetic function (hostile or friendly character). The believability of each character was surveyed with an online survey for research subjects recruited from a sophomore level introductory digital media course at a large Midwestern University. Within the survey, participants were shown a one–two-minute video of each NPC interacting with a player; participants then answered believability questions about the NPC they had just seen. Role-play gaming experience and demographics were also measured. An ANOVA analysis of the results suggested that NPCs from higher-rated games were perceived to be more believable than characters from lower-rated games. NPCs from higher-rated games were also found to be more enjoyable than characters from lower-rated games. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Underserved children, particularly girls and those in urban communities, do not meet the recommended physical activity guidelines (>60 min of daily physical activity), and this behavior can lead to obesity. The school years are known to be a critical period in the life course for shaping attitudes and behaviors. Children look to schools for much of their access to physical activity. Thus, through the provision of appropriate physical activity programs, schools have the power to influence apt physical activity choices, especially for underserved children where disparities in obesity-related outcomes exist. Objectives: To evaluate the impact of a nurse directed, coordinated, culturally sensitive, school-based, family-centered lifestyle program on activity behaviors and body mass index. Design, settings and participants: This was a parallel group, randomized controlled trial utilizing a community-based participatory research approach, through a partnership with a University and 5 community schools. Participants included 251 children ages 8–12 from elementary schools in urban, low-income neighborhoods in Los Angeles, USA. Methods: The intervention included Kids N Fitness©, a 6-week program which met weekly to provide 45 min of structured physical activity and a 45 min nutrition education class for parents and children. Intervention sites also participated in school-wide wellness activities, including health and counseling services, staff professional development in health promotion, parental education newsletters, and wellness policies for the provision of healthy foods at the school. The Child and Adolescent Trial for Cardiovascular Health School Physical Activity and Nutrition Student Questionnaire measured physical activity behavior, including: daily physical activity, participation in team sports, attending physical education class, and TV viewing/computer game playing. Anthropometric measures included height, weight, body mass index, resting blood pressure, and waist circumference. Measures were collected at baseline, completion of the intervention phase (4 months), and 12 months post-intervention. Results: Significant results for students in the intervention, included for boys decreases in TV viewing; and girls increases in daily physical activity, physical education class attendance, and decreases in body mass index z-scores from baseline to the 12 month follow-up. Conclusions: Our study shows the value of utilizing nurses to implement a culturally sensitive, coordinated, intervention to decrease disparities in activity and TV viewing among underserved girls and boys.

AB  - Purpose: This study examined links between diurnal patterns of the stress hormone cortisol and time spent by adolescents in nine common daily activities. Methods: During eight consecutive nightly telephone interviews, 28 youths (n = 12 girls), 10-18 years of age, reported their daily activities. On 4 days, four saliva samples were also collected and assayed for cortisol. Multilevel models assessed within- and between-person associations between time in each activity and cortisol area under the curve (AUC), cortisol awakening response (CAR), morning peak (30 minutes after wake up), and daily decline (morning peak to bedtime). Results: Links with AUC were found for most activities; significant associations with cortisol rhythms suggested that most effects were due to anticipation of the day's activities. Specifically, on days when youths spent more time than usual on video games and television, they had lower AUCs, with lower morning peaks. Youths who spent more time reading (within-person) and in computer-related activities (between-person) had higher AUCs, with stronger CARs (within-person). Youths who slept more had lower AUCs, with lower morning peaks on both the between- and within-person levels. Amounts of time spent in clubs, and for older adolescents in sports, were also linked to lower AUCs. Finally, youths who spent more time in school/schoolwork had lower average AUCs, but on days when youths spent more time than usual in school, they had higher AUCs, stronger CARs, and steeper daily declines. Conclusion: Beyond their known implications for psychological adjustment, youths' everyday activities are linked to stress physiology. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Though emotions have been shown to have sometimes dramatic effects on decision-making, the neural mechanisms mediating these biases are relatively unexplored. Here, we investigated how incidental affect (i.e. emotional states unrelated to the decision at hand) may influence decisions, and how these biases are implemented in the brain. Nineteen adult participants made decisions which involved accepting or rejecting monetary offers from others in an Ultimatum Game while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Prior to each set of decisions, participants watched a short video clip aimed at inducing either a sad or neutral emotional state. Results demonstrated that, as expected, sad participants rejected more unfair offers than those in the neutral condition. Neuroimaging analyses revealed that receiving unfair offers while in a sad mood elicited activity in brain areas related to aversive emotional states and somatosensory integration (anterior insula) and to cognitive conflict (anterior cingulate cortex). Sad participants also showed a diminished sensitivity in neural regions associated with reward processing (ventral striatum). Importantly, insular activation uniquely mediated the relationship between sadness and decision bias. This study is the first to reveal how subtle mood states can be integrated at the neural level to influence decision-making. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

In this article, we will see how the use of a computer game proves to be a vector of a first transference address from the psychotic to the clinician. Therefore, the virtual will be studied through the magnifying glass of the pathology, revealing a function of «emergence» specific to cybernetics. This function is triple. firstly, this contingency loads the emergence promises, allowing the user to expect from the machine anything but, and much more than, it is able to deliver. Secondly, this emergence gives the machine the appearance of autonomy, which helps the patient to delude himself into not considering himself as the origin of his representations. Lastly, this generator of representations enables the symptom by giving it a form, thus processing what Freud called a «force of healing drive» preparing the way for a transference relation.

AB  - Purpose: To investigate screen-time change from early to mid adolescence, its predictors, and its influence on body fat, blood pressure, and leisure-time physical activity. Methods: We used data from a longitudinal prospective study, conducted among participants of the 1993 Pelotas (Brazil) Birth Cohort Study. At baseline, adolescents were, on average, 11 years old. They were later visited at age 15 years. Screen time was self-reported, accounting for the time spent watching television, playing video games, and using the computer. Several predictors were examined. The effect of screen-time change on some health outcomes was also analyzed. Results: Screen time increased on average 60 min/d from 11 to 15 years of age, for the 4,218 adolescents studied. The groups that presented the highest increases in screen time were male, wealthiest, those whose mothers had higher education, and adolescents with a history of school failure. There were positive associations between screen-time change and body mass index, skinfold thickness, waist circumference, and leisure-time physical activity at 15 years of age. Conclusions: Screen time increased from early to mid adolescence. This increment was higher among boys and the wealthiest adolescents. Increases in screen time affected body composition, with negative implications on adiposity. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Although impaired social–emotional ability is a hallmark of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the perceptual skills and mediating strategies contributing to the social deficits of autism are not well understood. A perceptual skill that is fundamental to effective social communication is the ability to accurately perceive and interpret facial emotions. To evaluate the expression processing of participants with ASD, we designed the Let’s Face It! Emotion Skills Battery (LFI! Battery), a computer-based assessment composed of three subscales measuring verbal and perceptual skills implicated in the recognition of facial emotions. Methods: We administered the LFI! Battery to groups of participants with ASD and typically developing control (TDC) participants that were matched for age and IQ. Results: On the Name Game labeling task, participants with ASD (N = 68) performed on par with TDC individuals (N = 66) in their ability to name the facial emotions of happy, sad, disgust and surprise and were only impaired in their ability to identify the angry expression. On the Matchmaker Expression task that measures the recognition of facial emotions across different facial identities, the ASD participants (N = 66) performed reliably worse than TDC participants (N = 67) on the emotions of happy, sad, disgust, frighten and angry. In the Parts–Wholes test of perceptual strategies of expression, the TDC participants (N = 67) displayed more holistic encoding for the eyes than the mouths in expressive faces whereas ASD participants (N = 66) exhibited the reverse pattern of holistic recognition for the mouth and analytic recognition of the eyes. Conclusion: In summary, findings from the LFI! Battery show that participants with ASD were able to label the basic facial emotions (with the exception of angry expression) on par with age- and IQ-matched TDC participants. However, participants with ASD were impaired in their ability to generalize facial emotions across different identities and showed a tendency to recognize the mouth feature holistically and the eyes as isolated parts.

AB  - This article reports a meta-analysis of energy expenditure (EE) of playing active video games (AVGs). In particular, heart rate (HR), oxygen consumption (VO2), and EE were assessed and three moderators for the effects of AVGs—types of AVG, player age, and player weight status—were analyzed. The results show that playing AVGs significantly increased HR, VO2, and EE from resting. The effect sizes of playing AVGs on HR, VO2, and EE were similar to traditional physical activities. AVG type and player age were significant moderators for the effects of AVGs. The finding suggests that AVGs are effective technologies that may facilitate light- to moderate-intensity physical activity promotion. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Recent research in neuroeconomics suggests that social economic decision-making may be best understood as a dual-systems process, integrating the influence of deliberative and affective subsystems. However, most of this research has focused on young adults and it remains unclear whether our current models extend to healthy aging. To address this question, we investigated the behavioral and neural basis of simple economic decisions in 18 young and 20 older healthy adults. Participants made decisions which involved accepting or rejecting monetary offers from human and non-human (computer) partners in an Ultimatum Game, while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The partners’ proposals involved splitting an amount of money between the two players, and ranged from $1 to $5 (from a $10 pot). Relative to young adults, older participants expected more equitable offers and rejected moderately unfair offers ($3) to a larger extent. Imaging results revealed that, relative to young participants, older adults had higher activations in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) when receiving unfair offers ($1–$3). Age group moderated the relationship between left DLPFC activation and acceptance rates of unfair offers. In contrast, older adults showed lower activation of bilateral anterior insula in response to unfair offers. No age group difference was observed when participants received fair ($5) offers. These findings suggest that healthy aging may be associated with a stronger reliance on computational areas subserving goal maintenance and rule shifting (DLPFC) during interactive economic decision-making. Consistent with a well-documented 'positivity effect', older age may also decrease recruitment of areas involved in emotion processing and integration (anterior insula) in the face of social norm violation.

AB  - Although acute effects of violent video game (VVG) exposure on affect and behaviour have been studied extensively, less is known about VVG effects on cognition. The present study examined whether chronic exposure to VVGs was associated with alterations in emotional long-term memory. Participants completed an old-new recognition task with 300 pictures of scenes ranging in emotion (negative, neutral and positive). We analysed accuracy and reaction time data using diffusion modelling to test a desensitization hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, VVG players would show reduced memory or a less liberal response bias for negative stimuli, compared with nonplayers. Contrary to the desensitization hypothesis, VVG exposure was not associated with differences in memory or response bias. This result suggests that, unlike other cognitive domains, long-term memory may be robust to deleterious influences of chronic VVG exposure.

AB  - Uncertainty may be an important component of the motivation provided by learning games, especially when associated with gaming rather than learning. Three studies are reported that explore the influence of gaming uncertainty on engagement with computer- based learning games. In the first study, children (10–11 years) played a simple maths quiz. Participants chose their preferred reward for a correct answer prior to seeing each question. They could either receive a single point or toss an animated coin to receive 2 points for heads or none for tails. A preference for the uncertain option was revealed and this increased during the quiz. The second study explored the discourse around learning when pairs of participants (13–14 years) competed against the computer in a science quiz. Progress depended on the acquisition of facts but also on the outcomes of throwing dice. Discourse was characterized by a close intermingling of learning and gaming talk without salient problematic constructions regarding fairness when losing points due to gaming uncertainty. A final experiment explored whether, in this type of game, the uncertainty provided by the gaming component could influence players’ affective response to the learning component. Electrodermal activity (EDA) of 16 adults was measured while they played the quiz with and without the element of chance provided by the dice. Results showed EDA when answering questions was increased by inclusion of gaming uncertainty. Findings are discussed in terms of the potential benefits of combining gaming uncertainty with learning and directions for further research in this area are outlined.

AB  - This study investigated cognitive biases toward gaming-related words and differences in cognitive performance among twelve World of Warcraft players (WWP) and thirty non-players (NP). We measured response to valenced common English and WoW jargon words using a computer-based go/no-go task. Sometimes positive valence words were the targets for the ‘go’ response, with negative-valence words as the distracters, sometimes the reverse. Target discrimination (d′) and response disinhibition (C) were calculated using a signal detection analysis. Based on questionnaire responses, there were no differences between groups in depression, anxiety, smoking or drinking, but WWP reported significantly more screen and gaming time (17.31 h/week versus 4.12 among NP). WWP had faster reaction time (RT) and better discrimination of targets from distracters (high d′) but also showed higher disinhibition (low C). WWP also showed cognitive-bias toward game-related words in the form of higher d′ for WoW jargon than common English and more disinhibition to positive-valence WoW jargon. Similar to past studies which have found alcoholics to have cognitive biases toward alcohol-related words, WWP who play frequently showed cognitive biases toward words related to the World of Warcraft game.

AB  - With the general aggression model and presence (i.e., sense of 'being there') theory as frameworks, this study investigates the effects of violence cues (blood and screams of pain) and players' individual differences in aggression (trait aggression) on brand logo memory and on attitude change in a violent first-person shooter game (Half-Life 2). Physiological arousal (skin conductance levels) was assessed during game play and participants reported their sense of presence in the game. Results indicate that violence cues influence brand logo memory through engagement and affect attitude change via arousal. Although physiological arousal led to positive change in brand attitude, it does not significantly influence logo memory. Conversely, although higher levels of spatial presence led to better logo memory, there was a corresponding reduction in attitude change for highly recognized brands. We consider the possibility that increased memory but negative attitude change with higher presence in violent video games could deter advertisers from placing their messages inside violent games.

AB  - Synthesizing research in philosophy and phenomenology, this article offers a sympathetic critique of Vivian Sobchack’s view of digital moving images. Focusing on contemporary first- and third-player video games, it examines how digital imagery inscribes bodily dimensions onto a nonindexical world and the different ways in which we inhabit cinematic and electronic space. More specifically, it draws upon the writings of Maurice Merleau-Ponty to build a phenomenological model of bodies in digital imagery and argues that video gaming is a fully embodied, sensuous, carnal activity.

AB  - The current study utilized the General Aggression Model, with an emphasis on aggression-related priming, to explore the different effects on hostility, physiological arousal, and state aggression in those who played a violent video game (Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance) with differing levels of blood (maximum, medium, low, and off). Simple effects analyses showed that those in the maximum blood and medium blood conditions had a significant increase in hostility and physiological arousal, while those in the low blood and no blood conditions did not have such an increase in arousal and hostility. Further analyses indicated that those in the maximum and medium blood conditions used the character's weapon significantly more often than those in the low and blood absent conditions. Implications and future research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study investigated motivational strategies and the assessment of learners’ motivation during serious gameplay. Identifying and intelligently assessing the effects that these strategies may have on learners are particularly relevant for educational computer-based systems. We proposed, therefore, the use of physiological sensors, namely, heart rate, skin conductance, and electroencephalogram (EEG), as well as a theoretical model of motivation (Keller’s ARCS model) to evaluate six motivational strategies selected from a serious game called Food-Force. Results from nonparametric tests and logistic regressions supported the hypothesis that physiological patterns and their evolution are suitable tools to directly and reliably assess the effects of selected strategies on learners’ motivation. They showed that specific EEG 'attention ratio' was a significant predictor of learners’ motivation and could relevantly evaluate motivational strategies, especially those associated with the Attention and Confidence categories of the ARCS model of motivation. Serious games and intelligent systems can greatly benefit from using these results to enhance and adapt their interventions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study analyzed the effects of playing a violent computer game on emotional desensitization and aggressive behavior. College students (N = 58) were randomly assigned to play a violent game (VG) or a nonviolent game (NVG), and then were exposed to a set of emotional pictures. Participants’ physiological responses were recorded, and the Self-Assessment Manikin scale was used to assess affective valence and arousal while viewing the pictures. Participants were then asked to replay the game, after which aggressive behavior was measured. Participants’ violent game habits (VGH) were also measured. We found that VG playing interacted with participants’ VGH to influence aggression, and that self-reported valence mediated this effect by lowering the feelings of pleasure and displeasure toward emotional stimuli.

AB  - We examined the causal relationship between playing violent video games and increases in aggressiveness by using implicit measures of aggressiveness, which have become important for accurately predicting impulsive behavioral tendencies. Ninety-six adults were randomly assigned to play one of three versions of a computer game that differed only with regard to game content (violent, peaceful, or abstract game), or to work on a reading task. In the games the environmental context, mouse gestures, and physiological arousal—as indicated by heart rate and skin conductance—were kept constant. In the violent game soldiers had to be shot, in the peaceful game sunflowers had to be watered, and the abstract game simply required clicking colored triangles. Five minutes of play did not alter trait aggressiveness, yet an Implicit Association Test detected a change in implicit aggressive self-concept. Playing a violent game produced a significant increase in implicit aggressive self-concept relative to playing a peaceful game. The well-controlled study closes a gap in the research on the causality of the link between violence exposure in computer games and aggressiveness with specific regard to implicit measures. We discuss the significance of importing recent social-cognitive theory into aggression research and stress the need for further development of aggression-related implicit measures.

AB  - Objectives: The objective of this study was to study the effects of meditation on stress-induced changes in cognitive functions. Methods: The study was conducted on 32 healthy adult male student volunteers who had never practiced meditation before the study. The study consisted of practicing 20 minutes of guided meditation and administration of psychologic stress to the subjects. The psychologic stress was administered to the subjects by asking them to play a (preselected) stressful computer game. The subjects were asked to meditate either before or after the administration of psychologic stress. For the control group measurements, the subjects were asked to wait quietly for an equivalent period of meditation time. Outcome measures: The outcome measures were galvanic skin response (GSR), heart rate (HR), electromyography (EMG), sympathetic reactivity (QTc/QS2 ratio), cortisol, and acute psychologic stress scores. The central nervous system functions were assessed using Wechsler memory scale and visual-choice reaction time (VCRT). These parameters were measured both at the beginning and at the end of the intervention, using a pre–post experimental test design. Results: Computer game stress was associated with a significant increase in physiologic (GSR, EMG, HR, QTc/QS2) and psychologic (acute stress questionnaire scores) markers of stress. Meditation was associated with relaxation (significant decrease in GSR, EMG, QTc/QS2, and acute stress questionnaire scores). Meditation, if practiced before the stressful event, reduced the adverse effects of stress. Memory quotient significantly increased, whereas cortisol level decreased after both stress and meditation. VCRT showed no significant change. Conclusions: Practice of meditation produced a relaxation response even in the young adult subjects who had never practiced meditation before. The practice of meditation reduced the physiologic stress responses without taking away the beneficial effect of stress, namely, improved memory scores.

AB  - Stress related medical disorders such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, depression, and anxiety are serious medical issues that can cause disability and death. Interventions to prevent their development and exacerbation are needed. Casual video games (CVGs) are fun, easy to play, spontaneous and tremendously popular. People report that they play these games because they decrease their stress and improve their mood. This study tested this theory by comparing people playing Bejeweled II a popular CVG with control subjects measured under similar conditions. Electroencephalographic (EEG) changes after playing Bejeweled II were consistent with increased mood and corroborated with similar findings on psychological reports. Moreover, heart rate variability (HRV) changes consistent with autonomic nervous system relaxation or decreased physical stress were also recorded. It is concluded, therefore, that playing a CVG like Bejeweled II can increase mood and decrease stress. These finding have broad implications and include the potential development of prescriptive interventions using Bejeweled II to prevent and treat stress related medical disorders. Finally, these findings demonstrate a method using EEG, HRV and psychological correlates to understand the psychophysiological or cybernetic interconnection between participant and video game.

AB  - This essay is the first of a two-part article examining the use of narrative in computer and video games, which provides an overview and discussion of the definitions and representation of stories, plots, and narratives. A range of traditional and emerging narrative techniques are considered, including The Hero’s Journey, three-act structure, the portrayal of human emotions, and character archetypes, from where an in-depth examination of interactive narrative is performed on a range of old and modern games. Initial results pertaining to the time allocated to narrative, the use of back stories, cut scenes, on-screen text, prompts, and game structure are also presented, which reveal a distinct level of uniformity of how interactive narrative is depicted in games spanning over two decades of industry development. The analysis is concluded in the second article, where further results are revealed to help uncover the precise nature of game narratives. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study assessed the speed of recognition of facial emotional expressions (happy and angry) as a function of violent video game play. Color photos of calm facial expressions morphed to either an angry or a happy facial expression. Participants were asked to make a speeded identification of the emotion (happiness or anger) during the morph. Typically, happy faces are identified faster than angry faces (the happy-face advantage). Results indicated that playing a violent video game led to a reduction in the happy face advantage. Implications of these findings are discussed with respect to the current models of aggressive behavior. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The present case–control study investigated the processing of emotional pictures in excessive first-person-shooter-video-players and control persons. All participants of the fMRI experiment were confronted with pictures from four categories including pleasant, unpleasant, neutral content and pictures from the first-person-shooter-video-game 'Counterstrike'. Compared to controls, gamers showed a significantly lower activation of the left lateral medial frontal lobe while processing negative emotions. Another interesting finding of the study represents the higher activation of frontal and temporal brain areas in gamers when processing screen-shots from the first-person-shooter-video-game 'Counterstrike'. Higher brain activity in the lateral prefrontal cortex could represent a protection mechanism against experiencing negative emotions by down-regulating limbic brain activity. Due to a frequent confrontation with violent scenes, the first-person-shooter-video-gamers might have habituated to the effects of unpleasant stimuli resulting in lower brain activation. Individual differences in brain activations of the contrast Counterstrike > neutral pictures potentially resemble the activation of action-scripts related to the video-game.

AB  - Recent research has linked the enjoyment of entertaining media to the satisfaction of intrinsic human needs (Tamborini, Bowman, Eden, Grizzard, & Organ, 2010; Tamborini, Grizzard, et al., in press). The present investigation addressed the satisfaction of recovery needs through the use of interactive and noninteractive entertaining media stimuli and the resulting recovery outcomes. In an experiment (N=160), participants were first exposed to a working task to elicit the need for recovery and then randomly assigned to one of four experimental conditions: 1) a video game, 2) a video recording of a game, 3) an animated video clip, or 4) the control condition. The results demonstrate that interactive and noninteractive media stimuli elicit different patterns of recovery experience. Furthermore, recovery experience was significantly related to enjoyment as well as subjective (energetic arousal) and objective (cognitive performance) recovery outcomes. Enjoyment mediated the relationship between recovery experience and energetic arousal. The results demonstrate that the effects of need satisfaction associated with the use of entertaining media go beyond enjoyment and may affect recovery and psychological well being. The findings are discussed in terms of their implications for research on the recovery effects of entertaining media and for current needs-based approaches to media enjoyment.

AB  - One component of the recent obesity epidemic is the sedentary behaviour of children and adolescents e.g., use of video games consoles. The new generation of video games requires body movements and might thus increase activity. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether such games could have an effect on physical activity in obese adolescents in a clinical setting. Between March and May 2007 activity-promoting video games ('apvg') were offered to all 84 inpatients (aged 13–28 years) registered in a long-term rehabilitation programme on a voluntary base. Reasons for (non-)attendance were assessed. Frequency and duration of use of the activity-promoting video game sessions were documented. Furthermore, heart rate and activity counts during use of 'apvg', endurance training, and strength training were measured. Of 84 inpatients, 51 used the 'apvg' at least once (69%) over the study period. The median weekly use of the intervention was 27min during the first week (range 0–182min), declining to zero (range 0–74min) in week four. Mean heart rate during the sessions (mean 115bpm; 95% confidence interval 108–122bpm) was similar to the heart rate during strength training (106bpm; 101–112bpm). The results indicate that the video games could have an impact on the activity of obese adolescents and young adults. However, as the interest in the devices seems to be too low the suitability of them for weight reduction programmes in young people cannot be ensured.

AB  - Experimental research has shown that playing violent video games produces higher levels of aggressive cognition, aggressive affect, physiological arousal, and aggressive behavior (in the short-term) than nonviolent video games. However, there are two major limitations with these investigations. First, the majority of experimental studies that have compared the effects of violent versus non-violent video games on aggression have failed to equate these games in terms of competitiveness, difficulty, and pace of action. Thus, although the common finding is that violent video games produce higher levels of aggression than non-violent video games, other unmatched factors beyond the actual violent content may be responsible for the elevated levels of aggression. Second, previous experimental studies have tended to use a measure of aggression that may also measure competitiveness, leading to questions about whether violent video games are related to aggression or competitiveness. After describing these two limitations, how future research can address these gaps in the violent video game literature, and why this research is important, are discussed.

AB  - The automatic control of emotional expression in music is a challenge that is far from being solved. This paper describes research conducted with the aim of developing a system with such capabilities. The system works with standard MIDI files and develops in two stages: the first offline, the second online. In the first stage, MIDI files are partitioned in segments with uniform emotional content. These are subjected to a process of features extraction, then classified according to emotional values of valence and arousal and stored in a music base. In the second stage, segments are selected and transformed according to the desired emotion and then arranged in song-like structures. The system is using a knowledge base, grounded on empirical results of works of Music Psychology that was refined with data obtained with questionnaires; we also plan to use data obtained with other methods of emotional recognition in a near future. For the experimental setups, we prepared web-based questionnaires with musical segments of different emotional content. Each subject classified each segment after listening to it, with values for valence and arousal. The modularity, adaptability and flexibility of our system’s architecture make it applicable in various contexts like video-games, theater, films and healthcare contexts.

AB  - Objectives: The objectives of this study are to assess the social characteristics, coping strategies, self-esteem and depressive symptoms in a population-dependent and not dependent on video games online, in order to investigate the correlations existing between these characteristics. Method: The study was conducted among 193 subjects. Data were collected through a global questionnaire constituted of several scales. The global questionnaire consisted of a sociodemographic part (age, sex, social status, most played game, number of hours per week devoted to the game), a questionnaire assessing dependence and abuse according to the DSM -IV-TR, the feeling of social belonging scale (or ESAS which was doubled to collect information about the belonging in real life and virtual life), the Ways of coping check-list (WCCL), the Rosenberg self-esteem scale (EES), the Quality of interpersonal relations scale (EQRI), the UCLA Loneliness scale and the Center for epidemiologic studies depression scale (CES-D). The questionnaire was broadcasted on the Internet, specifically in the forums dedicated to 'massively multiplayer online role-playing games' and in young people's forums in specific subject headings. Results: The results show that there are significant differences between the two populations, especially regarding the social characteristics, depressive symptoms, self-esteem and coping strategies. In the entire population, 66 subjects (42%) were considered dependent on online video games and 92 subjects (58%) were not considered dependent. In the dependent population, the number of hours spent playing per week, the score of social belonging in the virtual life, the coping focused on the emotion, the score of loneliness or social isolation and the score obtained on the CES-D appeared more important than the scores obtained by the non-dependent. Moreover, the average age, the scores of social belonging in real life, self-esteem and sub-dimensions 'family' and 'friends' of the quality of interpersonal relations scale are lower than those obtained by the non-dependent. Furthermore, the number of hours of play per week, the feeling of social belonging, self-esteem, quality of family relationships and loneliness are predictive factors of addiction to video games online. Conclusion: These results suggest that one of the crucial issues in dependence is the monitoring of game practice. Indeed, dependence on video games is based on a real hardware that needs to be controlled and managed by a third party before the emergence of a dependency. Therefore the results of this study suggest the establishment of better prevention, especially among parents who are confronted in majority with a world and a technology that is unknown or too complicated. In the case of a proven addiction, the study proposes care therapy focused on the social link, especially the family link, and a particular care to work on self-esteem.

AB  - In recent years, media formats with risk‐glorifying content, such as video games that simulate illegal street racing ('bang and crash' games), films about extreme sports, and risky stunts have emerged as top sellers of the media industry. A variety of recent studies conducted by several researchers revealed that exposure to risk‐glorifying media content (e.g., video games that simulate reckless driving, smoking and drinking in movies, or depictions that glorify extreme sports) increases the likelihood that recipients will show increased levels of risk‐taking inclinations and behaviors. The present article (1) reviews the latest research on the detrimental impact of risk‐glorifying media on risk‐taking inclinations (cognitions, emotions, behaviors), (2) puts these findings in the theoretical context of recent sociocognitive models on media effects, and (3) makes suggestions to science and policymakers on how to deal with these effects in the future.

AB  - In recent years, there has been a surge in the quantity of media content that glorifies risk-taking behavior, such as risky driving, extreme sports, or binge drinking. The authors conducted a meta-analysis involving more than 80,000 participants and 105 independent effect sizes to examine whether exposure to such media depictions increased their recipients' risk-taking inclinations. A positive connection was found for overall, combined risk taking (g = .41); as well as its underlying dimensions: risk-taking behaviors (g = .41), risk-positive cognitions and attitudes (g = .35), and risk-positive emotions (g = .56). This effect was observed across varying research methods (experimental, correlational, longitudinal); types of media (video games, movies, advertising, TV, music); and differing risk-related outcome measures (e.g., smoking, drinking, risky driving, sexual behavior). Multiple moderator analyses revealed 2 theoretically new boundary conditions for sociocognitive models. First, the effect was stronger for active (i.e., video games) than for passive (e.g., film, music) exposure to risk-glorifying media content. Second, the effect was stronger when there was a high degree of contextual fit between the media content and type of risk-taking measure. The theoretical, practical, and societal implications of the present research synthesis are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Computer games are advocated as a promising tool bridging the gap between the controllability of a lab experiment and the mundane realism of a field experiment. At the same time, many authors stress the importance of observing real behavior instead of asking participants about possible or intended behaviors. In this article, the authors introduce an online virtual social environment, which is inhabited by autonomous agents including the virtual spouse of the participant. Participants can freely explore the virtual world and interact with any other inhabitant, allowing the expression of spontaneous and unprompted behavior. The authors investigated the usefulness of this game for the assessment of interactions with a virtual spouse and their relations to intimacy and autonomy motivation as well as relationship satisfaction with the real-life partner. Both the intimacy motive and the satisfaction with the real-world relationship showed significant correlations with aggregated in-game behavior, which shows that some sort of transference between the real world and the virtual world took place. In addition, a process analysis of interaction quality revealed that relationship satisfaction and intimacy motive had different effects on the initial status and the time course of the interaction quality. Implications for psychological assessment using virtual social environments are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The main aim of this study was to assess self-reported craving and physiological reactivity in a methamphetamine virtual reality (METH-VR) cue model created using Second Life, a freely available online gaming platform. Seventeen, non-treatment seeking, individuals that abuse methamphetamine (METH) completed this 1-day, outpatient, within-subjects study. Participants completed four test sessions: 1) METH-VR, 2) neutral-VR, 3)METH-video, and 4) neutral-video in a counterbalanced (Latin square) fashion. The participants provided subjective ratings of urges to use METH, mood, and physical state throughout each cue presentation. Measures of physiological reactivity (heart rate variability) were also collected during each cue presentation and at rest. The METH-VR condition elicited the greatest change in subjective reports of 'crave METH', 'desire METH', and 'want METH' at all time points. The 'high craving' participants displayed more high frequency cardiovascular activity while the 'low craving' participants displayed more low frequency cardiovascular activity during the cue conditions, with the greatest difference seen during the METH-VR and METH-video cues. These findings reveal a physiological divergence between high and low craving METH abusers using heart rate variability, and demonstrate the usefulness of VR cues for eliciting subjective craving in METH abusers, as well as the effectiveness of a novel VR drug cue model created within an online virtual world.

AB  - Does using a computer game improve students' motivation to learn classroom material? The current study examined students' motivation to learn history concepts while playing a commercial, off-the-shelf computer game, Civilization III. The study examined the effect of using conceptual scaffolds to accompany game play. Students from three ninth-grade classrooms were assigned to one of three groups: one group used an expert generated concept map, one group constructed their own concept maps, and a control group used no map. It was predicted that the use of concept maps would enhance the educational value of the game playing activity, in particular students' motivational levels; however, the opposite happened. Students who used a concept map showed lower motivation on the task relative to their baseline motivation for regular classroom instruction. In contrast, the levels of motivation in playing the game, for students in the control group, met or exceeded their levels of motivation during regular classroom instruction. These results suggest that using a conceptual scaffold can decrease students' motivation to learn classroom material through game play, perhaps because conceptual maps can (a) focus students' attention on the difficulty of learning the concepts and on the extrinsic rewards for playing the game and (b) make game play less autonomous, less creative, and less active. All of these can negate the primary property that provides playing its principal potential pedagogical power: fun. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - An experimental study was conducted to investigate the impact of violent computer games on state hostility, state anxiety and arousal. Participants were undergraduate students, aged from 18 to 25 years old. Before the experimental sessions, participants filled in self-report measures concerning their video game habits and were also pre-tested for aggressiveness and trait anxiety. Physiological responses (heart rate and skin conductance) were measured during the experiment. After playing, information about state hostility and state anxiety was collected. The results showed that participants who played the violent game reported significantly higher state hostility and support the assumption that an aggressive personality moderates the effect of playing a violent game on state hostility.

AB  - The present study focuses on the short-term effects of electronic entertainment media on memory and learning processes. It compares the effects of violent versus non-violent computer game content in a condition of playing and in another condition of watching the same game. The participants consisted of 83 female and 94 male adolescents with a mean age of 17.6 years. The dependent variables are memory for previously learnt verbal and visual material, memory for media-related content and physiological measures of stress (heart rate, cortisol, salivary alpha-amylase). Besides the group comparisons, potential mediation effects and gender differences were examined. The results show that violent content leads to a poorer memory performance for verbal material and to an increased heart rate. The heart rate, however, does not mediate the effect on memory performance. Genders differ regarding their abilities to memorise verbal and visual material, with females showing a better performance (independent of the experimental condition), and for memorising media-contents, where the males outperform females (also independent of experimental condition). The study supports the assumption that violent and arousing media content has a negative short-term effect on simultaneous information processing and learning and that there are gender-specific media effects.

AB  - The possible impact of technological advancement on video games' effects--particularly in the case of violent games--has often been discussed but has not been thoroughly explored by empirical research. The present investigation employed a 2 × 2 between subjects factorial experiment to examine the interplay of technological advancement and violence by exposing participants (N = 120) to either a newer or older version of a violent or nonviolent game and measuring these factors' effects on players' sense of presence, involvement, physiological arousal (measured by skin conductance), self-reported arousal, and affective and cognitive aggression. The results indicate that technological advancement increased participants' sense of presence, involvement, and physiological and self-reported arousal. Neither advancement nor violence had statistically significant effects on accessibility of players' aggressive thoughts, but there is some tentative evidence that violent game content increased players' state hostility. Theoretical and practical implications of findings are discussed, and recommendations are made for future research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study examines how emotive meaning is represented in visual images using the semiotic resources of facial expression, touch and body orientation. Complementing the cognitive metaphorical interpretation, the visually represented emotive behaviors are theorized as partial iconic representations of real life behaviors, which are in turn indexes of emotion. Adopting a social semiotic approach, this paper formulates facial expression, touch, and body orientation as inter-related systems of meaning, the selection and combination of which constitutes a systemic functional 'lexico-grammar' for analyzing and interpreting meaning making in visual imagery. The systems are then used to explain how emotive meanings are represented in comic books. The analysis shows that cartoonists’ systemic choices for representing emotions are largely consistent with the coding accuracy of facial behaviors on the one hand, and style guidelines advocated in comic handbooks on the other. Through the examination of both American and Japanese comics, it is demonstrated that the social semiotic lexico-grammatical approach is not only effective in explaining the emotion resources in nonverbal behavior, but also useful for investigating cultural differences in the visual depiction of emotion. The systemic choices also provide artists with a framework to 'design' emotion in creative visual media such as comics, and possibly in computer vision, game design and related domains.

AB  - Cognitive remediation training has been shown to improve both cognitive and social cognitive deficits in people with schizophrenia, but the mechanisms that support this behavioral improvement are largely unknown. One hypothesis is that intensive behavioral training in cognition and/or social cognition restores the underlying neural mechanisms that support targeted skills. However, there is little research on the neural effects of cognitive remediation training. This study investigated whether a 50 h (10-week) remediation intervention which included both cognitive and social cognitive training would influence neural function in regions that support social cognition. Twenty-two stable, outpatient schizophrenia participants were randomized to a treatment condition consisting of auditory-based cognitive training (AT) [Brain Fitness Program/auditory module ~60 min/ day] plus social cognition training (SCT) which was focused on emotion recognition [~5–15 min per day] or a placebo condition of non-specific computer games (CG) for an equal amount of time. Pre and post intervention assessments included an fMRI task of positive and negative facial emotion recognition, and standard behavioral assessments of cognition, emotion processing, and functional outcome. There were no significant intervention related improvements in general cognition or functional outcome. fMRI results showed the predicted group-by-time interaction. Specifically, in comparison to CG, AT+SCT participants had a greater pre-to-post intervention increase in postcentral gyrus activity during emotion recognition of both positive and negative emotions. Furthermore, among all participants, the increase in postcentral gyrus activity predicted behavioral improvement on a standardized test of emotion processing (MSCEIT: Perceiving Emotions). Results indicate that combined cognition and social cognition training impacts neural mechanisms that support social cognition skills. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Exposure to video game violence (VGV) is known to result in desensitization to violent material and may alter the processing of positive emotion related to facial expressions. The present study was designed to address three questions: (1) Does the association between VGV and positive emotion extend to stimuli other than faces, (2) is the association between VGV and affective picture processing observed with a single presentation of the stimuli, and (3) is the association between VGV and the response to violent stimuli sensitive to the relevance of emotion for task performance? The data revealed that transient modulations of the event-related potentials (ERPs) related to attentional orienting and sustained modulations of the ERPs related to evaluative processing were sensitive to VGV exposure.

AB  - With technology allowing for increased realism in video games, realistic, human-like characters risk falling into the Uncanny Valley. The Uncanny Valley phenomenon implies that virtual characters approaching full human-likeness will evoke a negative reaction from the viewer, due to aspects of the character’s appearance and behavior differing from the human norm. This study investigates if 'uncanniness' is increased for a character with a perceived lack of facial expression in the upper parts of the face. More important, our study also investigates if the magnitude of this increased uncanniness varies depending on which emotion is being communicated. Individual parameters for each facial muscle in a 3D model were controlled for the six emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness and surprise in addition to a neutral expression. The results indicate that even fully and expertly animated characters are rated as more uncanny than humans and that, in virtual characters, a lack of facial expression in the upper parts of the face during speech exaggerates the uncanny by inhibiting effective communication of the perceived emotion, significantly so for fear, sadness, disgust, and surprise but not for anger and happiness. Based on our results, we consider the implications for virtual character design. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - How long do the effects of the initial short-term increase in aggression and physiological arousal last after violent video game play? Study 1 (N = 91) had participants complete pre- and post video game measures of aggressive thoughts, aggressive feelings, and heart rate. Then, participants completed Time 3 measures after 4 min or 9 min of delay. Study 2 employed a similar procedure, but had participants (N = 91) complete the hot sauce paradigm to assess aggressive behavior after a 0, 5, or 10 min delay. First, results indicated that aggressive feelings, aggressive thoughts, aggressive behavior, and heart rate initially increased after violent video game play. Second, results of the delay condition revealed that the increase in aggressive feelings and aggressive thoughts lasted less than 4 min, whereas heart rate and aggressive behavior lasted 4-9 min.

AB  - The mis-categorizing of cognitive states involved in learning within virtual environments has complicated instructional technology research. Further, most educational computer game research does not account for how learning activity is influenced by factors of game content and differences in viewing perspectives. This study is a qualitative exploration into the nature of flow—the state of being absorbed by an activity, and presence—the sense of 'being there' in a virtual learning environment. This study follows players’ experiences within an immersive environment, with the notion of 'immersive' being the extent to which the computer system delivers a surrounding environment. The data analysis includes videotaped activity, transcripts and interviews of six different games, three of which have explicit learning objectives derived from two different genres. While viewing perspective was previously thought to have significant influence on presence, flow, and learning, these findings suggest that four emergent categories (content, emotion, motivation, engagement) have more influence than perspective.

AB  - Many early developmental theorists such as Freud, Erikson, Piaget, and Vygotsky suggested that play—which the authors of this article define as both playful activity and playful thought—had the power to influence the moral emotions, behaviors, and reasoning of children. More recent researchers have also found evidence of moral development in their observations of children’s play. But, the authors claim, there have been many changes in the culture of childhood and adolescence in the past twenty years, and these have affected both the amount of time spent in play and the types of play that prevail. This article describes potential changes in the nature of play related to three new technologies—technology-augmented toys, video games, and virtual communities—and reviews the research and theory about their impact on play and on moral development. The authors look at research (including their own), discuss the positive and negative influences of these new technologies, and describe the need for further investigation.

AB  - In this article I explore works by three artists in which we can see images that relate to bereavement. In the work of the first two, Araya Rasdjarmrearnsook and Andres Serrano, we can see photographic images (still and moving) of human corpses, which have been criticized as morbid and unhealthy. However I argue that it is not in fact images of death or the dead that are problematic but those images which present or evoke evidence of the emotions associated with death, and create a situation where we imagine the circumstances of our own deaths or the death of those we love. Images of the dead are acceptable as long as they do not cause pain to the living, as in a video game fantasy or a fiction, or are seen as other and distant. In the second group of works, by Gustgav Metzger, The Absent Dead: The Surrogate Body, the body is not present either because the death has taken place at a distance, either in time or geographically, or both, and a new site must be created. In this section, I discuss Metzger’s auto-destructive art and argue that these works, through their ephemerality, embody a form of ‘meaning making’ and a possibility of the benefits of grief as described by Parkes.

AB  - This paper addresses the problem of tuning the input and the output parameters of a fuzzy logic controller. The system learns autonomously without supervision or a priori training data. Two novel techniques are proposed. The first technique combines Q(λ)-learning with function approximation (fuzzy inference system) to tune the parameters of a fuzzy logic controller operating in continuous state and action spaces. The second technique combines Q(λ)-learning with genetic algorithms to tune the parameters of a fuzzy logic controller in the discrete state and action spaces. The proposed techniques are applied to different pursuit–evasion differential games. The proposed techniques are compared with the classical control strategy, Q(λ)-learning only, reward-based genetic algorithms learning, and with the technique proposed by Dai et al. (2005) [19] in which a neural network is used as a function approximation for Q-learning. Computer simulations show the usefulness of the proposed techniques.

AB  - This article presents a model of enjoyment rooted in self-determination theory (Deci & Ryan, 1985) that includes the satisfaction of three needs related to psychological wellbeing: autonomy, competence, and relatedness. In an experiment designed to validate this conceptualization of enjoyment, we manipulate video game characteristics related to the satisfaction of these needs and examine their relative effects on enjoyment. The validated model explains 51% of the variance in enjoyment, even without including needs usually studied in relation to enjoyment such as pleasure seeking. Results indicate the utility of defining enjoyment as need satisfaction. These results are discussed in terms of a broader conceptualization of enjoyment represented as the satisfaction of a comprehensive set of functional needs.

AB  - During recent years, there is an increasing interest in the relation between impairment of social cognition like Theory of Mind (ToM) and reduced social functioning in schizophrenia. ToM is the ability to mentally represent one's own and others mental states which is necessary to understand other people's intentions. Therefore ToM is an essential prerequisite for sufficient social interactions. Aim of the present study was to investigate the relation between social cognitive processes and their application to social decision making during interactions in schizophrenia by means of a modified trust game. 19 patients suffering from schizophrenia and 19 healthy controls were investigated while they were involved in a computer simulated social interaction. The task of the participants was to maximize their gains while playing with four virtual partners. They had to share money with those partners and depending on the partners' fairness the participants account was reduced or increased. Two of the partners were fair and two unfair For one of the fair and one of the unfair partners, the actual fairness could be inferred from the facial expression. Although we could not find any differences in emotion recognition or fairness ratings, the patients showed an impaired decision making behavior. In contrast to healthy controls, they did not use the emotional expression of their partner to adapt their behavior. The results are interpreted as reflecting the suitability of game theory based approaches to investigate social interaction deficits in schizophrenia. In particular the results demonstrate the inability of schizophrenia patients to integrate information raised from social cognitive processes into their concrete decision making behavior.

AB  - Background: Patients with schizophrenia have a high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). High aerobic intensity training (HIT) improve peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak), net mechanical efficiency of walking and risk factors for CVD but has not been investigated in patients with schizophrenia. Aims: To investigate effects from HIT on VO2peak, net mechanical efficiency of walking and risk factors for CVD in patients with schizophrenia. Methods: 25 inpatients (F20-29, ICD-10) were allocated to either HIT or playing computer games (CG), 3 days per week for 8 weeks. HIT consisted of 4 × 4-min intervals with 3-min break periods, at 85-95% and 70% of peak heart rate, respectively. Results: 12 and seven patients completed HIT and CG, respectively. The baseline VO2peak in both groups combined (n = 19) was 36.8 ± 8.2 ml/kg/min and 3.12 ± 0.55 1/min. The HIT group improved VO2peak by 12% from 3.17 ± 0.59 to 3.56 ± 0.68 1/min (P < 0.001), more than the CG group (P = 0.014). Net mechanical efficiency of walking improved by 12% in the HIT group from 19.8 ± 3.0% to 22.2 ± 4.5% (P = 0.005), more than the CG group (P = 0.031). The psychiatric symptoms, expressed as the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS), did not improve in either group. Conclusions: VO2peak and net mechanical efficiency of walking improved significantly by 8 weeks of HIT. HIT should be included in rehabilitation in order to improve physical capacity and contribute risk reduction of CVD. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Individuals with Prader–Willi syndrome (PWS) have been shown to demonstrate a particular cognitive deficit in attention switching and high levels of preference for routine and temper outbursts.This study assesses whether a specific pathway between a cognitive deficit and behaviour via environmental interaction can exist in individuals with PWS. Methods: Four individuals with PWS participated in a series of three single-case experiments including laboratory-based and natural environment designs. Cognitive (computer-based) challenges placed varying demands on attention switching or controlled for the cognitive demands of the tasks while placing no demands on switching. Unexpected changes to routines or expectations were presented in controlled games, or imposed on participants' natural environments and compared with control conditions during which no unexpected changes occurred. Behaviour was observed and heart rate was measured. Results: Participants showed significantly increased temper outburst related behaviours during cognitive challenges that placed demands on attention switching, relative to the control cognitive challenges. Participants showed significantly increased temper outburst related behaviours when unexpected changes occurred in an experimental or the natural environment compared with when no changes occurred. Conclusions: Difficult behaviours that could be triggered reliably in an individual by a specific cognitive demand could also be triggered via manipulation of the environment. Results suggest that a directional relationship between a specific cognitive deficit and behaviour, via environmental interaction, can exist in individuals with PWS.

AB  - Background: The emergence of a participatory culture, brought about mainly by the use of Web2.0 technology, is challenging us to reconsider aspects of teaching and learning. Adapting the learning-as-digital-game-building approach, this paper explores how new educational practices can help students build skills for the 21st century. Purpose: This paper examines elementary students' learning experiences through digital game building and playing. The following research questions guided the study: (1) What emotions do students experience during the process of building digital games for others to use?; (2) What traits do students display when they learn through digital game-building?; and (3) What do students learn from the digital game-building experience? Sample: The participants were 21 elementary students (19 boys and two girls), aged between seven and 11, who were on a summer camp at a university in Canada. Design and methods: This small-scale study made use of enactivism (Li, Clark, and Winchester, Instructional design and technology grounded in enactivism: A paradigm shift?, British Journal of Educational Technology 41, no. 3: 403-419, 2010), a new theoretical framework, as a basis for analysing the students' experiences and responses as they created computer games to teach others the concept of Isaac Newton's Three Laws of Motion. Quantitative and qualitative data collected included student and parent surveys, teacher and student interviews, field observations and the digital games created by the students. Data were subjected to quantitative and thematic analyses. Results: The results indicated that only a small minority of students reported never feeling the positive emotions excited/happy or smart/proud during the process of building digital games. In addition, analysis suggested that creativity, engagement and new identity were the three salient traits displayed by the students when learning by digital game-building. There was also evidence that students increased their understanding of the subject matter in question (mathematics, science and technology) and enhanced their general problem-solving abilities through the process. Conclusions: This small-scale study suggests that student engagement in the game-building experience can enhance not just the learning of the game design process but also subject matter and generic skills. Thus, the learning-as-building approach can empower students to 'take over the technology' and become creators rather than passive consumers.

AB  - Multiple studies have been addressing effects of playing violent video games. However, most such studies neglect users’ individual experiences. In fact, each player’s gameplaying choices creates his or her own specific game content. Within this study we analyzed the individually generated content of a typical first-person-shooter game with high temporal resolution and associated them with physiological response measures (heart rate, skin conductance) collected during the game play. Thirteen experienced game players played the multiplayer first-person-shooter game 'Tactical Ops: Assault on Terror' for 50 minutes on average. Playing phases and events in between were analyzed on both an intraplayer and interplayer level. Results indicate varying gaming experiences in the users and distinct arousal levels over time and for different game events. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Active video games (exergames) increase energy expenditure (EE) and physical activity (PA) compared with sedentary video gaming. The physiological cost and enjoyment of exergaming in adolescents, and young and older adults has not been documented, nor compared with aerobic exercise. This study compared the physiological cost and enjoyment of exergaming on Wii Fit with aerobic exercise in 3 populations. Methods: Cardiorespiratory and enjoyment measurements were compared in 14 adolescents, 15 young adults, and 13 older adults during handheld inactive video gaming, Wii Fit activities (yoga, muscle conditioning, balance, aerobics), and brisk treadmill walking and jogging. Results: For all groups EE and heart rate (HR) of Wii Fit activities were greater than handheld gaming (P < .001) but lower than treadmill exercise (P ≤ .001). Wii aerobics elicited moderate intensity activity in adolescents, young adults, and older adults with respective mean (SD) metabolic equivalents of 3.2 (0.7), 3.6 (0.8), and 3.2 (0.8). HR during Wii aerobics fell below the recommended intensity for maintaining cardiorespiratory fitness. Group enjoyment rating was greater for Wii balance and aerobics compared with treadmill walking and jogging (P ≤ .05). Conclusions: Wii Fit appears an enjoyable exergame for adolescents and adults, stimulating light-to-moderate intensity activity through the modification of typically sedentary leisure behavior.

AB  - This article surveys various differing approaches to religious simulation in gaming and interactive art, and reports on the design of a specific faith-based game from the designer’s perspective. It looks in-depth at one of a series of short experimental video games that explore the use of game mechanics to simulate various aspects of religious faith. A number of serious and casual games have been produced over the years by companies catering to religious audiences. These often merely add religious themes to mechanics appropriated from popular games. An example of this would be Cougar Interactive’s Zoo Race (2007), which thinly drapes the narrative of Noah’s Ark over a racing game. Although there are a small number of independent games that have begun to approach religious and spiritual ritual, such as Ian Bogost’s Guru Meditation (2009a), most religious games do not attempt to simulate the internal cognitive processes of faith. This article argues that there are opportunities that these games are missing in creating original gameplay that adds to a deeper understanding of their subject matter. The author demonstrates the idea that games, which through their rules have shown that they can provoke emotion and reflection in the player, can also simulate certain processes of faith.

AB  - To investigate the neural systems that contribute to the formation of complex, self-relevant emotional memories, dedicated fans of rival college basketball teams watched a competitive game while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). During a subsequent recognition memory task, participants were shown video clips depicting plays of the game, stemming either from previously-viewed game segments (targets) or from non-viewed portions of the same game (foils). After an old–new judgment, participants provided emotional valence and intensity ratings of the clips. A data driven approach was first used to decompose the fMRI signal acquired during free viewing of the game into spatially independent components. Correlations were then calculated between the identified components and post-scanning emotion ratings for successfully encoded targets. Two components were correlated with intensity ratings, including temporal lobe regions implicated in memory and emotional functions, such as the hippocampus and amygdala, as well as a midline fronto-cingulo-parietal network implicated in social cognition and self-relevant processing. These data were supported by a general linear model analysis, which revealed additional valence effects in fronto-striatal-insular regions when plays were divided into positive and negative events according to the fan's perspective. Overall, these findings contribute to our understanding of how emotional factors impact distributed neural systems to successfully encode dynamic, personally-relevant event sequences.

AB  - Playing violent video games is related to increased negative affect and cardiovascular reactivity. We examined the influence of high and low aggressive priming during video-game training on violence during game play (e.g., shooting, choking), hostility, frustration with game play, blood pressure, and heart rate. Male undergraduates (N=36) were assigned to a high aggressive or low aggressive video-game priming condition. After training, they played Metal Gear Solid®, which allows players to advance by using stealth, violence, or both. Participants in the high aggressive priming condition used significantly more violent action during game play and reported more hostility than those in the low aggressive priming condition. Heart rate was correlated with feelings of hostility. These findings indicate that both aggressive priming and use of game violence influence arousal and negative affect and might increase behavioral aggression.

AB  - Objective: To compare energy expenditure rates in children playing the physically active video games, Dance Dance Revolution (DDR) and Nintendo’s Wii Sports in relation to treadmill walking. Methods: Energy expenditure, heart rate, step rate, and perceived exertion were measured in 14 boys and 9 girls (ages 10–13 years; BMI at 3–98th percentile for age and gender) while watching television at rest, playing DDR at 2 skill levels, playing Wii bowling and boxing, and walking at 2.6, 4.2, and 5.7 km/h. Arterial elasticity was measured at rest and immediately after gaming. Results: Compared with watching television, energy expenditure while gaming or walking increased 2- to 3-fold. Similarly, high rates of energy expenditure, heart rate, and perceived exertion were elicited from playing Wii boxing, DDR level 2, or walking at 5.7 km/h. This occurred despite variations in step rate among activities, reflecting greater use of upper body during Wii play (lowest step rate) than during walking (highest step rate) or DDR play. Wii bowling and beginner level DDR elicited a 2-fold increase in energy expenditure compared to television watching. Large-artery elasticity declined immediately after both DDR and Wii. The change was inversely related to the increment in energy expenditure above rest achieved during the activity. Conclusions: Energy expenditure during active video game play is comparable to moderate-intensity walking. Thus, for children who spend considerable time playing electronic screen games for entertainment, physically active games seem to be a safe, fun, and valuable means of promoting energy expenditure.

AB  - Reviews the book, Glued to Games: How Video Games Draw Us In and Hold Us Spellbound by Scott Rigby and Richard M. Ryan (see record [rid]2012-01778-000[/rid]). Thee book offer a well-argued theory of video game engagement. They claim that video games capture us because they fulfill, in very powerful ways, specific and intrinsic human needs. These needs are competence, autonomy, and relatedness. Indeed, Rigby and Ryan argue that games that do not satisfy such needs well are not engaging or fun. Good games make us feel competent and give us a sense of mastery by facing and overcoming challenging problems. Autonomy exists when we feel our actions are freely chosen, when we feel we have a sense of mission and purpose. Relatedness involves knowing who we are and feeling that what we do matters to others and to the world. Rigby and Ryan offer a great many examples of how and why commercial games, including 'shooting games,' satisfy these needs. They also offer intriguing experimental data from their own work. The authors also present excellent discussions of addiction and violence in video games, based on their needs-satisfaction theory. To give one important and interesting example, they show that while some players say they prefer violent games, when faced with a game during which they tag people rather than shoot them, their level of fun and engagement remains just as high. In reality, what captivates them is the satisfaction of their needs and not the violence, though, of course, conflict and the resolution of conflict can help people feel a sense of mastery, of being on a mission, and of mattering to the world.

AB  - The rivalry between the men's basketball teams of Duke University and the University of North Carolina–Chapel Hill (UNC) is one of the most storied traditions in college sports. A subculture of students at each university form social bonds with fellow fans, develop expertise in college basketball rules, team statistics, and individual players, and self-identify as a member of a fan group. The present study capitalized on the high personal investment of these fans and the strong affective tenor of a Duke–UNC basketball game to examine the neural correlates of emotional memory retrieval for a complex sporting event. Male fans watched a competitive, archived game in a social setting. During a subsequent functional magnetic resonance imaging session, participants viewed video clips depicting individual plays of the game that ended with the ball being released toward the basket. For each play, participants recalled whether or not the shot went into the basket. Hemodynamic signal changes time locked to correct memory decisions were analyzed as a function of emotional intensity and valence, according to the fan's perspective. Results showed intensity-modulated retrieval activity in midline cortical structures, sensorimotor cortex, the striatum, and the medial temporal lobe, including the amygdala. Positively valent memories specifically recruited processing in dorsal frontoparietal regions, and additional activity in the insula and medial temporal lobe for positively valent shots recalled with high confidence. This novel paradigm reveals how brain regions implicated in emotion, memory retrieval, visuomotor imagery, and social cognition contribute to the recollection of specific plays in the mind of a sports fan.

AB  - This literature review focuses on the confirmed, suspected, and speculative effects of violent and non-violent video game exposure on negative and positive outcomes. Negative outcomes include aggressive feelings, aggressive thoughts, aggressive behavior, physiological arousal, and desensitization, whereas positive outcomes include various types of learning. Multiple theories predict, and empirical findings reveal, that violent video game exposure is causally related to a host of negative outcomes and a few positive outcomes. Some non-violent video games have been causally related to some specific positive learning effects as well as certain types of visual cognition (e.g., spatial rotation abilities) and may be associated with some negative effects on executive control and attention disorders.

AB  - Objective: To study the effects of group counseling which based on interpersonal activities and aimed at the college students with computer gaming addiction in China. Methods: Seventeen college students with computer game addiction were chosen as the experimental group, and 10 college students from another college were chosen as the control group. The two groups had no difference in the scores of Computer Gaming Addiction Invention (CGAI) and several other scales before group counseling. There were a pre-test and a post-test separately set when the group counseling was started and finished, focused on CGAI and negative emotions and cognitions. Results: In post-test, the score of CGAI in experimental group was significantly lower than that in control group [(92.6 ± 16.7) vs. (105.9 ± 13.0)] and lower than that in pre-test (98.9 ± 16.4) by analysis of covariance (Ps < 0.01). The scores of Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and the negative cognition of oneself in social settings in experimental group were also lower than those in control group [(6.4 ± 7.9) vs. (13.5 ± 5.6), (39.7 ± 6.4) vs. (49.9 ±10.3), (15.1 ±4.3) vs. (19.9 ± 3.0), Ps < 0.01], while the score of Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (SES) was higher than that of the control group [(29.3 ± 2.9) vs. (24.6 ± 4.8), P < 0.01]. Conclusion: Group counseling based on interpersonal activities has obvious effects on the college students with computer gaming addiction. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study tests whether playing violent video games leads to desensitization and increased cardiovascular responding. In a laboratory experiment, 42 men spent 20 min playing either a high- or low-violence version of a 'first-person shooter' game. Arousal (heart rate, respiration rate) was measured continuously. After playing the game, emotional responses to aversive and aggressive stimuli--pictures from Lang, Bradley, and Cuthbert's (1999) International Affective Picture System---were assessed with self-ratings and physiological measurement (skin conductance). Results showed no differences in the judgments of emotional responses to the stimuli. However, different effects of game violence emerged in the physiological reactions to the different types of stimulus material. Participants in the high-violence condition showed significantly weaker reactions (desensitization) to aversive stimuli and reacted significantly more strongly (sensitization) to aggressive cues. No support was found for the arousal hypothesis. Post-hoc analyses are used to discuss possible moderating influences of gaming experience and player's trait aggressiveness in terms of the General Aggression Model (Anderson & Bushman, 2001) and the Downward Spiral Model (Slater, Henry, Swaim, & Anderson, 2003).

AB  - Cardiovascular reactivity to stress and β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) function may contribute to the development of hypertension. As Black Americans have an increased risk of hypertension, we evaluated associations between β₁-AR (Arg389Gly) and β₂-AR (Arg16Gly, Gln27Glu) gene variants and cardiovascular reactivity in 500 Black youth. Heart rate, preejection period, total peripheral resistance, and blood pressure reactivity were measured during cold and psychological stress. The Arg389Gly polymorphism in the β₁-AR was associated with preejection period reactivity in males but not in females. The Arg16Gly polymorphism in the β₂-AR was associated with diastolic blood pressure reactivity only during video game stress. An association between the Gln27Glu polymorphism in the β₂-AR and vascular reactivity depended on sex. Thus, specific patterns of associations emerged between genetic variations in β-ARs and cardiovascular reactivity in young Blacks. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This article examines the effects of a non co-located opponent on self-reported emotions, psychophysiological responses, and presence experiences during digital game playing. In a within-subjects design, participants played Super Monkey Ball Jr. and Duke Nukem Advance against a computer, a non co-located friend, and a non co-located stranger. In addition to self-report ratings, electromyographic (EMG) activity over zygomaticus major, corrugator supercilii, and orbicularis oculi; cardiac interbeat intervals; and skin conductance level were measured to index positive activa- tion, negative activation, and physiological arousal. When com- pared to playing against a computer, playing against a human elicited more positive emotional responses and higher arousal, spatial presence, and engagement. In addition, playing against a friend elicited more positive emotional responses (as indexed by facial EMG) and higher self-reported arousal and engagement compared to playing against a stranger. The influence of opponent type on facial EMG responses was dependent on dispositional be- havioral activation system (BAS) and behavioral inhibition system (BIS) sensitivities of the player. Orbicularis oculi EMG responses to game violence varied also as a function of the player’s impulsivity. These data show that the mere knowledge of who is controlling the opponent character strongly influences emotional and other responses to digital games.

AB  - The general aggression model (GAM, Anderson & Bushman, 2002) provides a framework of the negative effect of the violent video games. It is assumed in the GAM that individual acts of aggression are caused by the interactions between situational (e.g., frustrations, or the presence of firearms), individual (e.g., personality and attitudes), and biological (e.g., increases in blood pressure) variables. The previous studies have shown that violent video games play an important role in the increases of aggressive behaviors, aggressive cognition, hostility, psychological arousal, and physiological responses. Because most of the existent research focuses only on examining the relationship between aggression and the playing of the violent video games, it still remains unclear how the situational, individual, and biological variables interact with each other to lead to the aggressive behaviors. The present two experiments were designed to investigate how the situational factors such as different ways (playing vs. observing) of presence of violence and different elements (shooting and blood) of violence in video games influence the aggressive behaviors and cognition. Seventy-two male undergraduates participated in the research. Half of the participants were asked to play the 45 degree shooting game called Alien Shooter, and the other half were asked to watch a video tape of somebody playing the same game. After a period of time of playing or observing the game, all the participants performed both the competitive reaction time task and the extrinsic affective Simon task. The results showed that: (1) players were more aggressive than observers in both tasks, which means that active involvement in the violent video games yielded more negative outcome than passive involvement did, and (2) both shooting and blood elements promote aggression of players, but only the blood element (not the shooting element which attracted more attention of the observer) made observers to infer that other players would be aggressive. The findings of the present research are valuable in the video game design, at least in terms of decreasing violence in the games. According to the present results, the application of substitution of shooting and blood in the game will lead to less violence of the game, and it in turn will decrease the negative effect of video game play.

AB  - For 14 teams of three young men, salivary testosterone and cortisol were assessed twice before and twice after competing in within-group and between-group video games that simulated violent male–male competition. Men who contributed the most to their teams' between-group victory showed testosterone increases immediately after the competition, but only if this competition was played before the within-group tournament. High-scoring men on losing teams did not show this immediate effect, but they did show a delayed increase in testosterone. In contrast, high-ranking men tended to have lower testosterone and higher cortisol during within-group tournaments. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that men's competitive testosterone response varies across ingroup and outgroup competitions and is muted during the former. The testosterone response during the between-group competition also suggests that violent multiplayer video games may be appealing to young men because they simulate male–male coalitional competition.

AB  - The present studies investigated why video racing games increase players’ risk-taking inclinations. Four studies reveal that playing video racing games increases risk taking in a subsequent simulated road traffic situation, as well as risk-promoting cognitions and emotions, blood pressure, sensation seeking, and attitudes toward reckless driving. Study 1 ruled out the role of experimental demand in creating such effects. Studies 2 and 3 showed that the effect of playing video racing games on risk taking was partially mediated by changes in self perceptions as a reckless driver. These effects were evident only when the individual played racing games that reward traffic violations rather than racing games that do not reward traffic violations (Study 3) and when the individual was an active player of such games rather than a passive observer (Study 4). In sum, the results underline the potential negative impact of racing games on traffic safety. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Repeated exposure to violent media is related to negative outcomes, including aggression, hostility, and cognitive and social deficits. We examined if cardiovascular and emotional responding to video game play changed across 3 weekly sessions. Participants were 41 adolescents (Mage = 14.8; male = 29; female = 12) from rural Appalachia. Participants attended 3 weekly sessions and played 1 of 3 video games (basketball, fighting, or horror) each time. Measures included heart rate (HR); systolic blood pressure (SBP); diastolic blood pressure (DBP); self-reported aggression, anger, and reactions to game play; and history of video game play. Resting and posttest cardiovascular measures did not differ from session to session. Adolescents displayed HR and SBP reactivity to game play within each session. They also demonstrated decreased SBP and DBP responding to video game play across the 3-week period, regardless of game content. Affective responses did not change significantly across the course of the experiment. Adolescents who played the violent games reported more frustration and arousal than those who played the sports game. The implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine how children cognitively and emotionally process interactive marketing of snack food products in advergames. Children (N = 30) aged 10 to 12 were asked to play advergames with (a) avatars that were assigned to them, (b) avatars chosen from a pool, and (c) self-designed avatars. The children’s skin conductance levels were collected during play. After gameplay, at each customization level, self-reported presence was collected. The results of this study indicate that customization of game avatars can affect both subjective feelings of presence and psychophysiological indicators of emotion during gameplay, which may make the gameplay experience more enjoyable. This may have implications for game sponsors and producers. Self-reported presence had no effect on psychophysiological indicators of emotion during gameplay. Implications of this finding and limitations of this study are discussed (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The use of video and computer games for recovery purposes was investigated in an online survey of 1614 participants. The data indicate that games are systematically used after exposure to stressful situations and strain, and that recovery experience is a significant facet of the gaming experience. Using structural equation modeling, the relationships among work-related fatigue, daily hassles, social support, coping style, recovery experience, and the use of video and computer games for recovery purposes were tested. Persons who associated stronger recovery experiences with game play used video and computer games more often after stressful and exhausting situations. In addition, participants’ level of work-related fatigue and exposure to daily hassles were both positively associated with the use of games for recovery. Participants with emotion-focused coping style showed a higher tendency to use games for recovery than participants with problem-focused coping style. The relationship between work-related fatigue and game use for recovery purposes was moderated by social support. The stress buffering function of video and computer games was more important for participants receiving less social support. These participants showed a stronger relationship between work-related fatigue and the use of games for recovery than participants receiving more social support.

AB  - Meta-analytic procedures were used to test the effects of violent video games on aggressive behavior, aggressive cognition, aggressive affect, physiological arousal, empathy/desensitization, and prosocial behavior. Unique features of this meta-analytic review include (a) more restrictive methodological quality inclusion criteria than in past meta-analyses; (b) cross-cultural comparisons; (c) longitudinal studies for all outcomes except physiological arousal; (d) conservative statistical controls; (e) multiple moderator analyses; and (f) sensitivity analyses. Social–cognitive models and cultural differences between Japan and Western countries were used to generate theory-based predictions. Meta-analyses yielded significant effects for all 6 outcome variables. The pattern of results for different outcomes and research designs (experimental, cross-sectional, longitudinal) fit theoretical predictions well. The evidence strongly suggests that exposure to violent video games is a causal risk factor for increased aggressive behavior, aggressive cognition, and aggressive affect and for decreased empathy and prosocial behavior. Moderator analyses revealed significant research design effects, weak evidence of cultural differences in susceptibility and type of measurement effects, and no evidence of sex differences in susceptibility. Results of various sensitivity analyses revealed these effects to be robust, with little evidence of selection (publication) bias. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Three fifth grade highly aggressive students participated in a study examining effects of an aggression intervention game. Using single-subject multiple baseline research design, the effect of the game was measured across three domains: attribution of peer intent (cognitive), emotional response (affective) and behavior response (behavioral). The results indicate that, while there were observable individual differences, the game had an immediate impact on attribution of peer behavior across all participants, had a less predictable impact on reported behavioral reactions, and had no discernable impact on reported emotional response. Theoretical and practical implications of the study are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - More Americans now play video games than go to the movies (NPD Group, 2009). The meteoric rise in popularity of video games highlights the need for research approaches that can deepen our scientific understanding of video game engagement. This article advances a theory-based motivational model for examining and evaluating the ways by which video game engagement shapes psychological processes and influences well-being. Rooted in self-determination theory (Deci & Ryan, 2000; Ryan & Deci, 2000a), our approach suggests that both the appeal and well-being effects of video games are based in their potential to satisfy basic psychological needs for competence, autonomy, and relatedness. We review recent empirical evidence applying this perspective to a number of topics including need satisfaction in games and short-term well-being, the motivational appeal of violent game content, motivational sources of postplay aggression, the antecedents and consequences of disordered patterns of game engagement, and the determinants and effects of immersion. Implications of this model for the future study of game motivation and the use of video games in interventions are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to report the perceived impact of various health concerns on the academic performance of health sciences graduate students. Design/methodology/approach: The American College Health Association’s National College Health Assessment (ACHA-NCHA), a 58-item anonymous survey, was distributed to all graduate health science students during a five-week period in the spring semester. Findings: Students (n = 1; 355) were most likely to report a negative perceived academic impact related to psychosocial concerns such as stress, depression/anxiety, and relationship problems. The students’ most pressing felt concerns were upper respiratory infections, stress, concerns about troubled loved ones and sleep difficulties. Clinical graduate students (n = 712) were significantly more likely to report negative academic impacts related to upper respiratory infections (p = 0:001), concern about a troubled friend or family member (p = 0:001), sleep difficulties (p = 0:005), relationship difficulties (p = 0:030), and internet use/computer games (p = 0:015) than non-clinical graduate students. However, the magnitude of those differences was small. Practical implications: This paper adds to one’s knowledge of student health concerns, which may help to address health-related barriers to learning. Originality/value: This paper presents findings that further explicate the reciprocal relationship between student health and learning by suggesting methodology to identify priority health issues among a graduate student population. Findings from this study of over 20 different health concerns indicate that the priority health concerns of graduate health science students are primarily psychological and psychosocial health issues.

AB  - Background: While there is emerging research outlining the physiologic cost of the physically interactive Nintendo Wii, there are no evaluations of the relative reinforcing value (RRV) of the Wii versus a sedentary alternative. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the physiologic cost, RRV, and liking of playing Wii Sports Boxing (Wii) versus a traditional sedentary video game (SVG) in 11 lean and 13 overweight/obese 8- to 12-yearold children. Methods: Heart rate (HR) and VO₂ were assessed during rest, treadmill walking, and playing an SVG and Wii using a counterbalance design. Liking was assessed during treadmill walking and video game play. RRV was assessed for Wii versus SVG. Results: Average HR, VO₂, and liking were significantly greater for Nintendo Wii (p ≤ 0.001 for all) than all other conditions. Lean children displayed a greater (p < 0.001) peak responding for access to Wii relative to the SVG while overweight/obese children did not (p ≥ 0.16). Conclusion: Wii was a well-liked activity of greater physiologic intensity than both the SVG and treadmill walking. Lean children were more motivated while overweight/ obese children were equally as motivated to play Wii relative to the SVG. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In this paper we present Turk-2, a hybrid multi-modal chess player with a robot arm and a screen-based talking head. Turk-2 can not only play chess, but can see and hear the opponent, can talk to him and display emotions. We were interested to find out if a simple embodiment with human-like communication capabilities enhances the experience of playing chess against a computer. First, give an overview of the development road to multi-modal communication with computers. Then we motivate our research with a hybrid system, we introduce the architecture of Turk-2, we describe the human experiments and its evaluation. The results justify that multi-modal interaction makes game playing more engaging, enjoyable—and even more effective. These findings for a specific game situation provide yet another evidence of the power of human-like interaction in turning computer systems more attractive and easier to use.

AB  - This study examined (a) gender differences in time spent on Internet, using internet for social support, coping, loneliness, and problematic Internet use; (b) variables that could effectively predict problematic Internet use for both genders; and(c) gender difference in the mediating effects of problematic Internet use. Participants were 752 undergraduate students (393 males and 359 females) who have used the Internet. Result: (a) Males yielded higher scores than females on total number of hours spent on the Internet per week, amount of time playing games online, problematic Internet use, loneliness, and problem-focused coping. In contrast, females produced higher scores on avoidance coping, seeking social support and online social-support, (b) Loneliness, time spent on playing video games, number of hours in interpersonal interact, emotion-focused coping and avoidance coping all effectively predicted problematic Internet use for both male and female students. (c) For both male and female students, results of the SEM analysis indicated that loneliness mediated the relationship between (both emotion-focused and avoidance) coping and problematic Internet use. For female students, there is a direct effect of (both emotion-focused and avoidance) coping on problematic Internet use. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Energy expenditure studies have shown that playing Active Video Games (AVGs) is positively associated with increases in heart rate and oxygen consumption. It is proposed that playing AVGs may be a useful means of addressing inactivity and obesity in children. This study explored children’s and parents’ perceptions of AVGs and the likely facilitators and barriers to sustained use of AVGs. Data were gathered using focus group interviews: seven with children, four with adults. Both children and parents reported that AVGs offered a way to increase activity and improve fitness. Barriers to sustained engagement, according to parents, were the cost of AVGs and lack of space in the home to play the games. According to children, the likelihood of long-term engagement with AVGs depended on game content and child age, with AVGs being seen as more appropriate for younger children than teenagers. It would appear that there is potential for AVGs to reduce inactivity in young people. However, barriers to widespread, sustainable adoption would need to be addressed if this potential is to be realized. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) are in need of effective and motivating physical fitness training programs. The aim was to test the effectiveness of a virtual reality (VR)-based exercise program in improving the physical fitness of adults with severe IDD when implemented by on-site caregivers. A research group (N = 20; mean age ± standard deviation = 47.9 ± 8.6 years; severe IDD level) was matched for age, IDD level and functional abilities with a comparison group (N = 24, mean age = 46.2 ± 9.3 years; severe IDD level). An 8-week fitness program consisting of 2–3 30-min sessions per week included game-like exercises provided by the IREX/GX video capture VR system. Changes in physical fitness were monitored by changes in heart rate at rest. A significant (P < 0.005) reduction in heart rate was demonstrated for the research group. No change in heart rate was monitored in the comparison group. Despite statistically significant improvements in heart rate, the results are not strong enough functionally to claim that this program improved physical fitness of individuals with severe intellectual disability.

AB  - Social exclusion increases aggressive behaviour, and the possible neuroendocrine underpinnings of the effect are largely unknown. Here, we examined the extent to which testosterone and cortisol responses to social exclusion would predict subsequent reactive aggression. Men were randomly assigned to a social exclusion (SE) or inclusion (SI) condition of ‘Cyberball’, a computer ball-toss game. Aggression was then measured using the Point Subtraction Aggression Paradigm (PSAP). Saliva was collected at three points for the measurement of testosterone and cortisol. Regression analyses indicated that testosterone concentrations 10-min into the PSAP (controlling for pre- and post-Cyberball testosterone) were positively correlated with aggressive behaviour, irrespective of SI/SE. Post hoc analyses for the conditions separately, however, suggested the relationship was stronger for SI men (R²change = 13.3%, F1, ₂₉ = 5.28, p = 0.03) than for SE men (R²change = 1.8%, F1, ₂₆ = 0.49, p = 0.49). Aggressive behaviour was also positively correlated with cortisol concentrations 10-min into the PSAP (controlling for pre- and post-Cyberball cortisol) irrespective of SE/SI. When both hormones were included in the regression model, the interaction of baseline ‘Cortisol’ × ‘Testosterone’ × ‘Experimental Group’ approached significance (R²change = 5.4%, F1, ₅₅ = 3.53, p = 0.07), but no significant effects were observed in either group alone. The findings add to evidence that individual differences in state neuroendocrine function map onto variability in human social behaviour. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - [Correction Notice: An erratum for this article was reported in Vol 52(2) of Human Factors (see record [rid]2010-19336-020[/rid]). In the February 2010 print issue of Human Factors, Figures 1 (page 19) and 2 (page 20) were erroneously printed in black and white. The color images are included here.] Objective: This study examined the impact of increasing automation replanning rates on operator performance and workload when supervising a decentralized network of heterogeneous unmanned vehicles. Background: Futuristic unmanned vehicles systems will invert the operator-to-vehicle ratio so that one operator can control multiple dissimilar vehicles connected through a decentralized network. Significant human-automation collaboration will be needed because of automation brittleness, but such collaboration could cause high workload. Method: Three increasing levels of replanning were tested on an existing multiple unmanned vehicle simulation environment that leverages decentralized algorithms for vehicle routing and task allocation in conjunction with human supervision. Results: Rapid replanning can cause high operator workload, ultimately resulting in poorer overall system performance. Poor performance was associated with a lack of operator consensus for when to accept the automation’s suggested prompts for new plan consideration as well as negative attitudes toward unmanned aerial vehicles in general. Participants with video game experience tended to collaborate more with the automation, which resulted in better performance. Conclusion: In decentralized unmanned vehicle networks, operators who ignore the automation’s requests for new plan consideration and impose rapid replans both increase their own workload and reduce the ability of the vehicle network to operate at its maximum capacity. Application: These findings have implications for personnel selection and training for futuristic systems involving human collaboration with decentralized algorithms embedded in networks of autonomous systems.

AB  - Computer and videogames often require that users interact with other characters on the screen that represent other real people or characters that are controlled by computer code running within the game. The difference between game play with other avatars (player-controlled characters) or agents (characters controlled by the computer) may influence the engagement a game player experiences. This study investigated the effects of agency (avatar versus agent) and the type of gaming activity (competition versus cooperation) on physiological arousal and subjective evaluation of play. A 2 (avatar, agent)×2 (competition, cooperation) within-subject experiment was conducted (N=32). Players exhibited greater physiological arousal to otherwise identical interactions when other characters were introduced as an avatar rather than an agent. Furthermore, the co-player's source of agency interacted with the type of gaming activity. The results have implications for understanding how different forms of representation in virtual worlds and games will affect psychological responses in the contexts of entertainment, learning and the conduct of serious work.

AB  - We report two studies aimed at investigating the effects of distinct negative emotions on pairwise economic interactions. In the ultimatum game, a proposer offers a division of a sum of money to a responder who decides whether to accept the split, or reject and leave both players with nothing. In Experiment 1, we investigated whether induced disgust, as compared to sadness and neutral emotion, specifically influences responders' decisions to reject unfair proposals. In Experiment 2, we assessed whether the effects of disgust were selectively related to social contexts by contrasting interactions with a human partner with those involving a computer. Results showed that relative to being in a sad or neutral mood, induced feelings of disgust significantly increased rejection rates of unfair offers. Moreover, we found that when the partner was not responsible for the fairness violation, such as in the computer-offer condition, the disgust induction failed to affect participants' choices. We conclude by focusing on the hypothesis that disgust and social norm violations may share common computational components, both at a psychological and a neural level.

AB  - Portable media consoles are becoming extremely popular devices for viewing a number of different types of media content, both for entertainment and for educational purposes. Given the increasingly heavy use of portable consoles as an alternative to traditional television-style monitors, it is important to investigate how physiological and psychological effects of portable consoles may differ from those of television-based consoles, because such differences in physiological and psychological responses may precipitate differences in the delivered content’s effectiveness. Because portable consoles are popular as a delivery system for multiple types of media content, such as movies and video games, it is also important to investigate whether differences between the effects of portable and television-based consoles are consistent across multiple types of media. This article reports a 2 × 2 (console: portable or television-based × medium: video game or movie) mixed factorial design experiment with physiological arousal and self-reported flow experience as dependent variables, designed to explore whether console type affects media experiences and whether these effects are consistent across different media. Results indicate that portable media consoles evoke lower levels of physiological arousal and flow experience and that this effect is consistent for both video games and movies. These findings suggest that even though portable media consoles are often convenient compared to television-based consoles, the convenience may come at a cost in terms of the user experience.

AB  - In everyday life, one increasingly encounters virtual characters. Virtual (online) worlds, on the one hand, are populated by avatars, that is, mediated human interlocutors represented by a virtual body. Examples are Second Life or Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPG) like World of Warcraft. On the other hand, websites, pedagogical programs, or technological devices are increasingly being equipped with virtual characters programmed to act autonomously and to conduct basic verbal and nonverbal interaction with the human user. The present special issue focuses on the latter form of virtual characters that have been developed to facilitate human-technology interaction. These agents are developed for, and sometimes already employed in, various areas of application: commercial applications such as so-called chatbots on websites (e.g., Anna of the Ikea website), virtual trainers such as that of the Wii fit, or virtual agents in navigation systems (http://www.charamel.com/). Research groups are developing and testing virtual agents for information kiosks (Cassell et al., 2002; Jung & Kopp, 2003), as health advisors (Bickmore, Pfeifer, & Jack, 2009), as TV/VCR assistants (Krämer, Tietz, & Bente, 2003) or as virtual teachers and tutors (Graesser et al., 2008; Lester, Towns, Callaway, Voerman, & FitzGerald, 2000; Rickel & Johnson, 2000) (for an overview see Krämer, 2008a). Although the development of and research on virtual agents is first and foremost being advanced by researchers from computer science, psychological research now also plays an important role. In order to equip virtual agents with humanlike communication skills and to iteratively optimize the systems with the help of evaluation studies, psychological knowledge as well as psychological methods are needed. However, psychological research on embodied agents is fruitful not only with regard to applied research, but also with respect to fundamental research. In this regard, Krämer and Bente (2007; Krämer, Bente, Troitzsch, & Eschenburg, 2009) distinguished basic research and applied research (realization research and evaluation research).

AB  - The study focused on chronotype-related differences in subjective load assessment, sleepiness, and salivary cortisol pattern in subjects performing daylong simulated driving. Individual differences in work stress appraisal and psychobiological cost of prolonged load seem to be of importance in view of expanding compressed working time schedules. Twenty-one healthy, male volunteers (mean ± SD: 27.9 ± 4.9 yrs) were required to stay in semiconstant routine conditions. They performed four sessions (each lasting ∼2.5 h) of simulated driving, i.e., completed chosen tasks from computer driving games. Saliva samples were collected after each driving session, i.e., at 10:00–11:00, 14:00–15:00, 18:00–19:00, and 22:00–23:00 h as well as 10–30 min after waking (between 05:00 and 06:00 h) and at bedtime (after 00:00 h). Two subgroups of subjects were distinguished on the basis of the Chronotype Questionnaire: morning (M)- and evening (E)-oriented types. Subjective data on sleep need, sleeping time preferences, sleeping problems, and the details of the preceding night were investigated by questionnaire. Subjective measures of task load (NASA Task Load Index [NASA-TLX]), activation (Thayer's Activation-Deactivation Adjective Check List [AD ACL]), and sleepiness (Karolinska Sleepiness Scale [KSS]) were applied at times of saliva samples collection. M- and E-oriented types differed significantly as to their ideal sleep length (6 h 54 min ± 44 versus 8 h 13 min ± 50 min), preferred sleep timing (midpoint at 03:19 versus 04:26), and sleep index, i.e., ‘real-to-ideal’ sleep ratio, before the experimental day (0.88 versus 0.67). Sleep deficit proved to be integrated with eveningness. M and E types exhibited similar diurnal profiles of energy, tiredness, tension, and calmness assessed by AD ACL, but E types estimated higher their workload (NASA-TLX) and sleepiness (KSS). M types exhibited a trend of higher mean cortisol levels than E types (F = 4.192, p < .056) and distinct diurnal variation (F = 2.950, p < .019), whereas E types showed a flattened diurnal curve. Cortisol values did not correlate with subjective assessments of workload, arousal, or sleepiness at any time-of-day. Diurnal cortisol pattern parameters (i.e., morning level, mean level, and range of diurnal changes) showed significant positive correlations with sleep length before the experiment (r = .48, .54, and .53, respectively) and with sleep index (r = .63, .64, and .56, respectively). The conclusions of this study are: (i) E-oriented types showed lower salivary cortisol levels and a flattened diurnal curve in comparison with M types; (ii) sleep loss was associated with lower morning cortisol and mean diurnal level, whereas higher cortisol levels were observed in rested individuals. In the context of stress theory, it may be hypothesized that rested subjects perceived the driving task as a challenge, whereas those with reduced sleep were not challenged, but bored/exhausted with the experimental situation.

AB  - Objective: To determine whether an exercise intervention using an active video game (Dance Dance Revolution™ [DDR]) is effective in improving endothelial dysfunction (EDF) and other risk factors in overweight children. Design: Thirty-five children (Body mass index ≥85th percentile, mean age 10.21 ± 1.67 years, 17 females) with EDF were assessed for flow-mediated dilation (FMD), lipids, insulin, glucose, NO₂ + NO₃, asymmetric dimethylarginine, symmetric dimethylarginine, L-arginine, height, weight, aerobic fitness, and blood pressure. In a subsample, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, and adiponectin were also assessed. Subjects were randomly assigned to 12-weeks of aerobic exercise (EX) using DDR or to a non-exercising delayed-treatment control group (DTC). Results: EX had significant improvements in FMD (5.56 ± 5.04% compared with 0.263 ± 4.54%, p = 0.008), exercise time on the graded exercise test (53.59 ± 91.54 compared with −12.83 ± 68.10 seconds, p = 0.025), mean arterial pressure (MAP) (−5.62 ± 7.03 compared with −1.44 ± 2.16 mmHg, p = 0.05), weight (0.91 ± 1.53 compared with 2.43 ± 1.80 kg, p = 0.017) and peak VO₂ (2.38 ± 3.91 compared with −1.23 ± 3.18 mg/kg/min, p = 0.005) compared with the DTC. Thirteen EX subjects achieved normal EDF while ten did not. These groups differed at baseline with regard to total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Conclusion: Twelve weeks of DDR-use improved FMD, aerobic fitness, and MAP in overweight children. Improvements occurred without changes in inflammatory markers or nitric oxide production. The results document the need to explore relationships between obesity, endothelial function, inflammation, lipids, exercise intensity, and gender in a larger sample of overweight children.

AB  - Stress related medical disorders such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and depression are serious medical issues that can cause disability and death. Techniques to prevent their development and exacerbation are needed. Casual video games (CVGs) are fun, easy to play, spontaneous and are tremendously popular. In this randomized controlled study we tested the effects of CVGs on mood and stress by comparing people playing CVGs with control subjects under similar conditions. Electroencephalography (EEG) changes during game play were consistent with increased mood and corroborated findings on psychological reports. Moreover, heart rate variability (HRV) changes were consistent with autonomic nervous system relaxation or decreased physical stress. In some cases CVGs produced different brain wave, heart rate variability and psychological effects. These finding have broad implications which include the potential development of prescriptive interventions using casual video games to prevent and treat stress related medical disorders.

AB  - This study examined the desensitizing effect of active or passive exposures to violent video games on male college students’ physiological arousal when viewing a violent film. The study employed a 2 (active or passive exposure) × 2 (violent or nonviolent video game) factorial design. Half of the forty-four participants were randomly assigned to either playing a violent video game or watching the records of someone else playing the violent game for 15 minutes, and the other half assigned to playing or watching a nonviolent video game. Then all the participants were presented with a 10-minute long violent film segment while their heart rate (HR) and galvanic skin response (GSR) were being recorded. The result showed that participants who previously played or viewed a violent video game had lower GSR while viewing the violent film than those who previously played or watched a nonviolent video game. This result demonstrated a physiological desensitization effect of exposure to violent video games on physiological arousal toward violence. However, the way of exposure, active or passive, to violent video games failed to show any influence on the degree of desensitization, although actively-playing group reported more enjoyment and less frustration than did passively-viewing group. Results were interpreted and discussed using the General Aggression model. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study assesses the impact of violent video game content on players’ game performance. According to the desensitization hypothesis (Carnagey, Anderson, & Bushman, 2007), violent content may elicit negative affective responses and inhibitions, which in turn should interfere with performance. On the other hand, the players might understand virtual violent acts as a digital form of rough-and-tumble play, associated with positive emotions and mobilization, which in turn should raise performance. To test these competing hypotheses on game performance, N = 50 males with no prior violent gaming experience were exposed to three different versions of a custom-made video game in which the actions to be performed were identical, though they were audio-visually presented to appear either nonviolent, moderately, or extremely violent. The results show no indication of an initial inhibition of aggressive behavior, that is, performance is elevated and remains so if the action is presented audio-visually as being violent. This supports the notion that being involved in violent video game activity is perceived as an essentially harmless acting-out of playful fighting behavior.

AB  - Exercise games that employ video game technology are increasing in the marketplace but have received scant research attention despite their popularity. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of videobike gaming on the constructs of the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and adherence in comparison to a cycling condition where participants listen to self-selected music. Participants were 29 inactive young men assigned randomly to experimental (n = 16) or comparison (n = 13) conditions. The recommended training regime consisted of moderate intensity activity (60–75% heart rate reserve), 3 days/week for 30 min/day for 6 weeks. At the end of the first session, participants were asked to complete TPB measures and these were subsequently measured 6 weeks later. Attendance was used as the measure of adherence. Results showed that affective attitude and adherence across the 6 weeks significantly favored the videobike condition over the comparison condition. Regression analyses suggested partial mediation of the effect of the videobike condition on adherence via affective attitude. This is the first study to provide evidence that interactive videobikes may improve adherence over traditional cycling because the activity produces higher affective attitudes. The results are promising for expanding to community-based evaluation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: Examine if home environmental factors are associated with screen-viewing. Methods: Data are for 2670, 3rd and 9th grade participants in Denmark, Portugal, Estonia and Norway collected between 1997 and 2000. Outcomes were spending >2 h after-school watching television (TV) and >1 h per day playing computer games. Child Autonomy and the home TV Environment were exposures. Results: Each unit increase in Child Autonomy was associated with 9% increase in risk of watching more than 2 h of TV per day after school and a 19% increase in risk of spending more than an hour per day playing computer games. TV Environment was associated with a 31% per unit increase in risk of watching >2 h of TV after school and 11% increase in risk of spending >1 h playing computer games. Conclusions: A family environment in which after-school TV viewing is part of the home culture and homes where children have more autonomy over their own behavior are associated with an increased risk of watching >2 h of TV per day after school and spending more >1 h per day playing computer games. The home screen-viewing environment and Child Autonomy may be malleable targets for changing screen-viewing. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Throughout the community of game players, developers, and journalists, the term 'independent' is used in a number of ways to describe a type of development next to, or juxtaposed with, the mainstream process of creating, marketing, distributing, and playing digital games. Yet, this 'independence' is something quite different from what the literature on independent, alternative, oppositional, radical, or otherwise nonmainstream media tends to suggest or advocate. The contemporary context of game design and development practices throughout the industry forces us to rethink assumptions about independence and autonomy in creative labor, about the communicative practices between media companies across the entire business spectrum of the global media industry, and about diversity or homogeneity in the production of culture. In this article, we aim to articulate more precisely what it means to create, work in, and give meaning to independent computer and video game production.

AB  - The combination of psychophysiological and psychometric methods provides reliable measurements of affective user experience (UX). Understanding the nature of affective UX in interactive entertainment, especially with a focus on sonic stimuli, is an ongoing research challenge. In the empirical study reported here, participants played a fast-paced, immersive first-person shooter (FPS) game modification, in which sound (on/off) and music (on/off) were manipulated, while psychophysiological recordings of electrodermal activity (EDA) and facial muscle activity (EMG) were recorded in addition to a Game Experience Questionnaire (GEQ). Results indicate no main or interaction effects of sound or music on EMG and EDA. However, a significant main effect of sound on all GEQ dimensions (immersion, tension, competence, flow, negative affect, positive affect, and challenge) was found. In addition, an interaction effect of sound and music on GEQ dimension tension and flow indicates an important relationship of sound and music for gameplay experience. Additionally, we report the results of a correlation between GEQ dimensions and EMG/EDA activity. We conclude subjective measures could advance our understanding of sonic UX in digital games, while affective tonic (i.e., long-term psychophysiological) measures of sonic UX in digital games did not yield statistically significant results. One approach for future affective psychophysiological measures of sonic UX could be experiments investigating phasic (i.e., event-related) psychophysiological measures of sonic gameplay elements in digital games. This could improve our general understanding of sonic UX beyond affective gaming evaluation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of developmental neuropsychiatric disorders, comprised of three diagnostic entities—autistic disorder (AD), Asperger's disorder (AS), and Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (including atypical autism) (PDD-NOS). A number of intervention techniques are currently used to reduce some of the associated challenges, with techniques ranging from behavioral therapy to dietary interventions and traditional counseling. This positional paper proposes the use of video games which leverage affective computing technologies as intervention in autism spectrum disorders in the context of the use of traditional play therapy with adolescents, who may feel uncomfortable engaging in traditional play with toys they may be too old for. It aims to explore the potential for greater 'social physics' made possible by affective computing technologies. This involves computationally 'recognizing' emotions in a user, often through the use of multimodal affective sensors, including facial expressions, postural shifts, and physiological signals such as heart rate, skin conductivity, and EEG signals. However, it is suggested that this should be augmented by researching the effect of social game design mechanisms on social-emotional development, particularly for those who experience difficulty with social interaction.

AB  - It has been posited that excessive computer game playing behavior, referred to as computer game addiction, meets criteria that have been internationally established to define drug addiction. Nevertheless, there have been no psychophysiological investigations of the underlying mechanisms available to support the characterization of excessive computer gaming as behavioral addiction. To investigate whether excessive computer gaming parallels learning processes in development and maintenance (which are assumed to underlie drug addiction), the authors obtained a psychophysiological assessment of the (learned) emotional processing of computer game-relevant and -irrelevant cues. For this purpose, electroencephalographic recordings in excessive and casual computer game players were conducted. Significant between-group differences in event-related potentials evoked by computer game related-cues were found at parietal regions and point to an increased emotional processing of these cues in excessive pathological players compared with casual players. These results are in concordance with the suggestion that addiction is characterized and maintained through sensitization of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system along with incentive salience of specific addiction-associated cues.

AB  - To determine the degree to which emotional changes in speech reflect factors other than arousal, such as valence, the authors used a computer game to induce natural emotional speech. Voice samples were elicited following game events that were either conducive or obstructive to the goal of winning and were accompanied by either pleasant or unpleasant sounds. Acoustic analysis of the speech recordings of 30 adolescents revealed that mean energy, fundamental-frequency level, utterance duration, and the proportion of an utterance that was voiced varied with goal conduciveness; spectral energy distribution depended on manipulations of pleasantness; and pitch dynamics depended on the interaction of pleasantness and goal conduciveness. The results suggest that a single arousal dimension does not adequately characterize a number of emotion-related vocal changes, lending weight to multidimensional theories of emotional response patterning.

AB  - A recent development in video games is that players can design and personalize their own in-game characters. It was predicted that this innovation could lead to elevations in the intensity of the psychological effects of video games. The present study confirmed this hypothesis, revealing that participants who played an aggressive video game using their own, personalized character exhibited higher levels of aggressive behavior than participants who played an aggressive game with a non-personalized character. The aggressive behavior levels of the own-character players also exceeded those of individuals who played a non-aggressive game, regardless of whether or not they used a personalized character. Process analyses revealed that participants playing a violent video game with a personalized game character experienced more arousal and self-activation than they did when playing with an impersonal, default game character, which in turn increased aggressive responses.

AB  - Objective: Researchers have yet to explore the effect of physically interactive video game playing on energy expenditure, despite its potential for meeting current minimal daily activity and energy expenditure recommendations. Participants and Methods: Nineteen male college students—12 experienced Dance Dance Revolution (DDR) players and 7 inexperienced players—completed maximal oxygen uptake assessments and a 30-minute DDR gaming session. The authors recorded heart rate (HR), rating of perceived exertion (RPE), respiratory exchange rate (RER), oxygen consumption (VO₂), and total steps (TS₃₀). Results: Experienced participants showed higher exercise HR, RPE, RER, VO₂, total and relative energy expenditure, exercise intensity, TS₃₀, and average steps per minute, and less time and steps to expend 150 kilocalories (p < .05). Conclusions: Participants with greater playing experience can work at higher intensities, promoting greater energy expenditure. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Two studies assessed whether playing video games would significantly distract participants from painful stimulation via a cold pressor test. In Study 1, participants (8 men, 22 women, M age=18.5 yr., SD=1.3) in an action-oriented game condition tolerated pain for a longer time period and reported lower pain intensity ratings than those in a nonaction-oriented game or a nongame control condition. No differences were found on scores of aggressiveness, competitiveness, or prior video game experience, suggesting that these factors play little role. In Study 2, participants (14 men, 13 women, M age= 19.7 yr., SD = 1.3) engaged in six video game conditions (action, fighting, puzzle, sports, arcade, and boxing) and a nongame control condition. Video game play produced an increase in pulse, which was greatest during the action, fighting, sports, and boxing games. Pain tolerance was greatest during the sports and fighting games. Thus, certain games produce greater distraction, which may have implications for the medical field as an adjunct to pain management. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Previous research has suggested that the spontaneous display of positive emotion may be a reliable signal of cooperative tendency in humans. Consistent with this proposition, several studies have found that self-reported cooperators indeed display higher levels of positive emotions than non-cooperators. In this study, we defined cooperators and non-cooperators in terms of their behavior as the proposer in an ultimatum game, and video-taped their facial expressions as they faced unfair offers as a responder. A detailed analysis of the facial expressions displayed by participants revealed that cooperators displayed greater amounts of emotional expressions, not limited to positive emotional expression, when responding to unfair offers in the ultimatum game. These results suggest that cooperators may be more emotionally expressive than non-cooperators. We speculate that emotional expressivity can be a more reliable signal of cooperativeness than the display of positive emotion alone. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Testimonies of video games’ excessive players lead to questions about the human condition : how can forge an identity for oneself and build an itinerary within the 'societies of the instant', characterised by uncertainty and disinclination? The desire for recognition is carried out in new inter-subjective structures which control even the autonomy of individuals. Highlight of the culture of the image and of the interactiveness wherein the body occupies a particular position—missing in the flesh, but at the helm of the avatar, the pixelated body. Insofar as they offer the possibility of living experiences with others, video games appear to be a favourable place in which to fabricate an identity.

AB  - Six studies, two survey based and four experimental, explored the relations between violent content and people’s motivation and enjoyment of video game play. Based on self-determination theory, the authors hypothesized that violence adds little to enjoyment or motivation for typical players once autonomy and competence need satisfactions are considered. As predicted, results from all studies showed that enjoyment, value, and desire for future play were robustly associated with the experience of autonomy and competence in gameplay. Violent content added little unique variance in accounting for these outcomes and was also largely unrelated to need satisfactions. The studies also showed that players high in trait aggression were more likely to prefer or value games with violent contents, even though violent contents did not reliably enhance their game enjoyment or immersion. Discussion focuses on the significance of the current findings for individuals and the understanding of motivation in virtual environments.

AB  - Examined the relationship between Type A personality and arousal in computer-game play. Ss were 12 Type A individuals (mean age 24.3 yrs) and 12 Type B individuals (mean age 24.1 yrs). It was hypothesized that, during computer-game play, Type A and Type B Ss would have significantly higher heart rates as compared with baseline levels and that Type A Ss would experience a significantly greater increase in arousal when playing a computer game than Type B Ss. Both hypotheses were supported. Findings suggest that computer game players become aroused while playing, that through this arousal they may be more likely to play again, and that Type A individuals might be more susceptible to addiction because they experience greater arousal.

AB  - Music listening in everyday life tends to accompany the completion of other everyday activities in a highly personalised manner. However, music and task performance studies have tended to be experimenter-centred and contextually isolated, largely independent of the listener's music practices and preference. The present study adopted a listener-centred approach to compare the effects of self-selected and experimenter-selected music (high and low arousal), on concurrent activity performance and experience. 125 participants completed three laps of a driving game in either (i) silence (ii) car sounds alone; car sounds with the addition of (iii) self-selected music, (iv) High-Arousal music or (v) Low-Arousal music. Three performance measures (accuracy-collisions, time-ms, and speed-mph) and 5 experience measures (distraction, liking, appropriateness, enjoyment, and tension-anxiety) were taken. Participants exposed to their self-selected music were most efficient, perceived lowest distraction, highest enjoyment, liking and appropriateness, and experienced a reduction in tension-anxiety. In contrast, performance and experience were poorest when exposed to High-Arousal experimenter-selected music. Participants were most inaccurate, perceived highest distraction, lowest liking, enjoyment and appropriateness, and experienced an increase in tension-anxiety. Collectively, the findings highlight the efficacy of self-selected music as a tool to optimise response in the everyday activity context for which it is selected. Accordingly, the results are discussed in relation to potential implications for the performance and experience of concurrent tasks such as video games. Additionally, the discussion highlights theories of attention-distraction, arousal and affect modification, and subjective experiences of music listening.

AB  - Recent meta-analytic findings (Sherry, 2007) suggest that the effect of violent video games on aggression tends to decrease the longer participants play. Therefore, it is likely that different mechanisms may be at work depending on the length of play. In this study, we employed a 4 (length of game play) × 2 (sex) design to examine the effect of length of video game play on aggressive outcomes. Findings suggest that length of play may be curvilinearly related to verbal and physical aggression, and that arousal may mediate this response. Implications for our current understanding of the relationship between video games and aggression are discussed, along with directions for further research.

AB  - The objective was to investigate the effects of different rated violent computer games regarding to the types of personality on cardiovascular reactions among Iranian adolescents. 209 participants (108 girls, 101 boys) were selected by cluster sampling among the first grade students of secondary schools in Tehran. The mean age was 12,7 (ranged from 12 to 15 years). The subjects were divided into 9 groups including a control group and 8 experimental groups which played selected electronic games for 40 minutes. Each participant's blood pressure and heart rate was recorded 10 minutes before beginning and 5 minutes to the end of the game on sedentary position and from the left wrist by blood pressure monitor. All the subjects filled out Eysenck Personality Inventory before the experiment. Data analyzing by ANOVA method revealed that cardiovascular reactions were moderated by playing different rated violent electronic games but they were not affected by different personality traits. Cardiovascular arousal in some of the games was affected by the rate of game challenging. These findings provide modest support for the aggression catharsis hypothesis.

AB  - Investigated the relationship between violent video games and children's mood. A total of 71 children aged 8-12 yrs played a paper-and-pencil game, a nonviolent video game, and a violent video game. Results indicate that arousal, as measured by heart rate and self-reported arousal, increased significantly after playing the violent video game, as compared with the other 2 game conditions, with girls reporting more arousal than did boys. There was no significant increase in aggressive mood scores for either boys or girls after playing the violent game. Positive mood, as measured by positive affect, showed no significant increases or decreases after playing either video game. However, positive mood, as measured by general mood, showed a significant increase after playing the violent game for both boys and girls, but only as compared with the paper-and-pencil game. Results are interpreted in terms of social learning and cognitive information processing theories of aggression. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Notes that research on exposure to television and movie violence suggests that playing violent video games will increase aggressive behavior. In this study the authors examine the role that violent video games have on aggressive behavior. A literature search was conducted on PsychINFO for all entries through the year 2000. A meta-analytic review of the video-game research literature reveals that violent video games increase aggressive behavior in children and young adults. Experimental and non-experimental studies with males and females in laboratory and field settings support this conclusion. Analyses also reveal that exposure to violent video games increases physiological arousal and aggression-related thoughts and feelings. Playing violent video games also decreases prosocial behavior (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - During recent years, research on colour vision has used traditional visual colorimeters, cathode ray tubes (CRT), and personal-computer controlled LCD-TFT screens to generate chromatic stimuli. We here explore the possibilities offered by a particular family of electronic devices whose use has lately been expanding rapidly, and which have one or more TFT screens and all the hardware needed for portable and autonomous use: handheld game consoles. We considered the different consoles available on the market, and as a result conducted an initial comparative study of two models—Sony PSP and Nintendo DS. As a result of this study, we checked the potential of using the Nintendo DS console, of which more than 100 million units have been sold worldwide. The results of our tests clearly indicated that it can be used as a tool in colour vision and physiological optics at the same technical level as CRT or TFT screens.

AB  - Background: The ability to mentalize, i.e. develop a Theory of Mind (ToM), enables us to anticipate and build a model of the thoughts, emotions and intentions of others. It has long been hypothesised that women differ from men in their mentalizing abilities. In the present fMRI study we examined the impact of (1) gender (women vs. men) and (2) game partner (human vs. computer) on ToM associated neural activity in the medial prefrontal cortex. Groups of men (n=12) and women (n=12) interacted in an iterated classical prisoner's dilemma forced choice situation with alleged human and computer partners who were outside the scanner. Results: Both the conditions of playing against putative human as well as computer partners led to activity increases in mPFC, ACC and rTPJ, constituting the classic ToM network. However, mPFC/ACC activity was more pronounced when participants believed they were playing against the alleged human partner. Differences in the medial frontal lobe activation related to the sex of the participants could be demonstrated for the human partner>computer partner contrast. Conclusion: Our data demonstrate differences in medial prefrontal brain activation during a ToM task depending on both the gender of participants and the game partner.

AB  - This study investigated whether people could learn to control a computer using a biofeedback interface that integrated their galvanic skin response (GSR), heart rate, and temperature. Twenty participants played a computer game using the biofeedback device, both individually and in pairs. Results indicated that most people learned to control the game after a single training session. The GSR measure was the most sensitive means of control. Pairs of participants controlled the device more effectively than single individuals did. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - [Correction Notice: An erratum for this article was reported in Vol 43(4) of Journal of Experimental Social Psychology (see record [rid]2007-08759-020[/rid]). The publisher regrets that some of the authors' corrections were not incorporated. The legend to Fig. 2 should read: 'Heart rate at baseline, after playing a video game, and while watching filmed real-life violence for violent and nonviolent video game players. Mean heart rates for violent and nonviolent video game players during the viewing of filmed real-life violence were 70.7 and 68.5, respectively. All means are adjusted for gender. Capped vertical bars denote 1 SE.' Some of the means in Fig. 3 do not correspond to the means in the text, and the legend is missing some information. Fig. 3 should be replaced with the figure and legend given in the erratum. On page 494, in the first paragraph, two F-tests are misreported. The fourth to the last sentence should be replaced with: 'Furthermore, nonviolent game participants had a slight (nonsignificant) increase in GSR change while viewing the film, F(1,127)=.52, p>.05, d=.13, whereas violent game participants showed a decrease in GSR, F(1,113)=7.19, p<.05, d=.50.'] Past research shows that violent video game exposure increases aggressive thoughts, angry feelings, physiological arousal, aggressive behaviors, and decreases helpful behaviors. However, no research has experimentally examined violent video game effects on physiological desensitization, defined as showing less physiological arousal to violence in the real world after exposure to video game violence in the virtual world. This experiment attempts to fill this gap. Participants reported their media habits and then played one of eight violent or nonviolent video games for 20min. Next, participants watched a 10-min videotape containing scenes of real-life violence while heart rate (HR) and galvanic skin response (GSR) were monitored. Participants who previously played a violent video game had lower HR and GSR while viewing filmed real violence, demonstrating a physiological desensitization to violence. Results are interpreted using an expanded version of the General Aggression Model. Links between desensitization, antisocial, and prosocial behavior are discussed.

AB  - We present a probabilistic model of user affect designed to allow an intelligent agent to recognise multiple user emotions during the interaction with an educational computer game. Our model is based on a probabilistic framework that deals with the high level of uncertainty involved in recognizing a variety of user emotions by combining in a Dynamic Bayesian Network information on both the causes and effects of emotional reactions. The part of the framework that reasons from causes to emotions (diagnostic model) implements a theoretical model of affect, the OCC model, which accounts for how emotions are caused by one’s appraisal of the current context in terms of one’s goals and preferences. The advantage of using the OCC model is that it provides an affective agent with explicit information not only on which emotions a user feels but also why, thus increasing the agent’s capability to effectively respond to the users’ emotions. The challenge is that building the model requires having mechanisms to assess user goals and how the environment fits them, a form of plan recognition. In this paper, we illustrate how we built the predictive part of the affective model by combining general theories with empirical studies to adapt the theories to our target application domain. We then present results on the model’s accuracy, showing that the model achieves good accuracy on several of the target emotions. We also discuss the model’s limitations, to open the ground for the next stage of the work, i.e., complementing the model with diagnostic information.

AB  - In this paper,we present the robot programming and planning language READYLOG, a GOLOG dialect, which was developed to support the decision making of robots acting in dynamic real-time domains, such as robotic soccer. The formal framework of READYLOG, which is based on the situation calculus, features imperative control structures such as loops and procedures, allows for decision-theoretic planning, and accounts for a continuously changing world. We developed high-level controllers in READYLOG for our soccer robots in RoboCup's Middle-size league, but also for service robots and for autonomous agents in interactive computer games. For a successful deployment of READYLOG on a real robot it is also important to account for the control problem as a whole, integrating the low-level control of the robot (such as localization, navigation, and object recognition) with the logic-based high-level control. In doing so, our approach can be seen as a step towards bridging the gap between the fields of robotics and knowledge representation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Media consumption and video gameplay can contribute to a sedentary lifestyle. Nevertheless, video games may have the potential to actually enhance children's physical activity. Objective: To explore the potential of video games to contribute to children's health and physical activity. Study Group: Twelve British children (seven female, five male) aged 8-11 years. Methods: The children participated in daily video-game play during school lunch times for one week. Focus group interviews were employed, pre and post the game play week, to examine children's perceptions of video games in relation to physical activity and health. Physical activity was assessed during all game play periods using pedometry and heart rate monitoring. Results: Pre the game play period, all children reported that video games had a negative impact on health and physical activity. Post game play, children reported that active video gameplay was an attractive alternative to traditional forms of physical activity that might be more attractive to nonexercisers. The results during the gameplay period revealed that boys and girls accumulated 10% and 11% of the recommended number of steps/day for health and also engaged in an average of 11 minutes (or 46% of the monitoring period) sustained moderate to vigorous physical activity through active video gaming each day. Conclusions: Although video games have traditionally been regarded as a negative influence on children's physical activity, active video games may provide a viable alternative to traditional physical activity. Even a short duration of daily active video-game play can contribute significantly to children achieving the recommended daily volume of physical activity.

AB  - This study examined the gender-specific cardiovascular and performance responses to playing the violent video game 'DOOM' with and without the soundtrack. Men and women equally rated the game as more violent with the soundtrack. Men performed the game about twice as well with the soundtrack. Women's performance did not change at all. Only men's heart rates were significantly greater with the soundtrack, indicative of arousal. Only women's systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly greater with the soundtrack, indicative of stress. The game seemed to appeal more to men than to women. Moreover, women may possibly avoid violent video games, in part because they represent an undesirable stressor. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The 'Mozart effect' is the reported phenomenon of increased spatial abilities after listening to that composer's music. However, subsequent research suggests that the Mozart effect may be an artifactual consequence of heightened arousal and mood rather than the music of Mozart per se (e.g., Thompson, Schellenberg, & Husain, 2001). The present study considers if performance improvements in a scored computer game are consistent with the mood and arousal hypothesis. Indeed, the use of a computer game as the experimental vehicle makes this work notably the most ecologically valid study of the Mozart effect to date. Specifically, in this work, ratings of musical preference as well as the game performance of individuals listening to different types of music are compared. If arousal and mood are the real 'Mozart effect,' we hypothesized that the performance level of participants would increase when listening to the selections they most enjoy. Results supported this hypothesis. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - We analyzed heart rate (HR), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), oxygen consumption, and carbon dioxide production in 17 male adolescents during a racing simulation video game (VG) and compared to resting state (RS) and exercise testing (ET) measures. We were able to demonstrate a significant (p < .005) increase from RS to VG concerning HR (+13.1 bpm), SBP (+20.8 mmHg), and DBP (+12.1 mmHg) with SBP and DBP elevations exceeding 2 SD in all children and 14/17 children, respectively. The energy consumption during VG (max 1.71 kcal/min) was unaltered compared to RS and significantly lower compared to ET even at the starting strain of 25 W (1.94 kcal/min). Hemodynamic parameters tested demonstrated lower HR, unchanged SBP, and higher DBP during the VG compared with ET. Comparing all measured parameters it can be said that the relation of blood pressure and energy consumption during VG might not be favorable.

AB  - Decades of research have demonstrated that exposure to violence on television can cause increases in aggression. The recent emergence of violent video games has raised new questions regarding the effects of violent media. The General Aggression Model (GAM) predicts that exposure to violent media increases aggressive behavior through one of three primary pathways (arousal, cognitions, and affect). Past psychophysiological research has supported GAM but has been limited to examining arousal-related variables. Recent advances in social neuroscience have opened the door to investigations of exposure to violent media on cognitive and affective components and their neurocognitive underpinnings. Neuroscience tools have the potential to provide answers to the new questions posed by recent advances in media technology. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study was conducted to analyze the short-term effects of violent electronic games, played with or without a virtual reality (VR) device, on the instigation of aggressive behavior. Physiological arousal (heart rate (HR)), priming of aggressive thoughts, and state hostility were also measured to test their possible mediation on the relationship between playing the violent game (VG) and aggression. The participants—148 undergraduate students—were randomly assigned to four treatment conditions: two groups played a violent computer game (Unreal Tournament), and the other two a non-violent game (Motocross Madness), half with a VR device and the remaining participants on the computer screen. In order to assess the game effects the following instruments were used: a BIOPAC System MP100 to measure HR, an Emotional Stroop task to analyze the priming of aggressive and fear thoughts, a self-report State Hostility Scale to measure hostility, and a competitive reaction-time task to assess aggressive behavior. The main results indicated that the violent computer game had effects on state hostility and aggression. Although no significant mediation effect could be detected, regression analyses showed an indirect effect of state hostility between playing a VG and aggression.

AB  - EMOTLAB software creates a virtual social environment in which individuals interact via computer with a virtual interaction partner in a series of economic bargaining games. The virtual partner appears on the participant's computer screen as a digital image (e.g., video or picture file) during each trial. A key feature of EMOTLAB software is its ability to control both the strategic behavior and the emotion signaling behavior (e.g., anger vs. embarrassment) of the virtual interaction partner. By simply editing a series of text files that control the subroutines governing the different features of the experiment (payoff structure, number of trials, etc.), EMOTLAB can generate an essentially infinite number of different social bargaining situations in which participants earn monetary payoffs contingent upon their decisions. This paper provides an overview of this software and how one can edit various subroutines to generate a typical experimental session in which research participants encounter a virtual interaction partner who displays different emotional signals.

AB  - Previous research has shown that exposure to violent media increased aggression-related affect and thoughts, physiological arousal, and aggressive behavior as well as decreased prosocial tendencies. The present research examined the hypothesis that exposure to prosocial media promotes prosocial outcomes. Three studies revealed that listening to songs with prosocial (relative to neutral) lyrics increased the accessibility of prosocial thoughts, led to more interpersonal empathy, and fostered helping behavior. These results provide first evidence for the predictive validity of the General Learning Model [Buckley, K. E., & Anderson, C. A. (2006). A theoretical model of the effects and consequences of playing video games. In P. Vorderer, & J. Bryant, (Eds.), Playing video games: Motives responses and consequences (pp. 363-378). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates] for the effects of media with prosocial content on prosocial thought, feeling, and behavior. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Few longitudinal studies have examined ethnic and sex differences, predictors and tracking stabilities of heart rate variability (HRV) at rest and in response to stress in youths and young adults. Methods: Two evaluations were performed approximately 1.5 years apart on 399 youths and young adults (189 European Americans [EAs] and 210 African Americans [AAs]; 190 males and 209 females). HRV was measured at rest and during a video game challenge. Results: AAs showed significantly higher resting root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) of normal R–R intervals and high-frequency (HF) power than EAs (ps < 0.01). Females displayed larger decrease of RMSSD and HF during video game challenge than males (ps < 0.05). These ethnic and sex differences were consistent across 1.5 years. No significant sex difference of resting HRV or ethnic difference of HRV response to stress was observed. In addition to age, ethnicity or sex, baseline resting HRV or HRV response to stress are predictors of the corresponding variables 1.5 years later (ps < 0.01). Furthermore, weight gain indexed by either body mass index or waist circumference predicts declined resting HRV levels during follow up (ps < 0.05). Tracking stabilities were high (> 0.5) for resting HRV, but relatively low (< 0.3) for HRV in response to stress. Conclusion: AAs show higher resting HRV than EAs, and females display greater HRV response to stress than males; and these ethnic and sex differences are consistent across 1.5 years. Resting HRV declines with weight gain. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In this study, the relations among political ideology, exploratory behavior, and the formation of attitudes toward novel stimuli were explored. Participants played a computer game that required learning whether these stimuli produced positive or negative outcomes. Learning was dependent on participants’ decisions to sample novel stimuli and discover the associated valence. Political ideology correlated with exploration during the game, with conservatives sampling fewer targets than liberals. Moreover, more conservative individuals exhibited a stronger learning asymmetry, such that they learned negative stimuli better than positive. Mediational analyses revealed that the differences in learning were due to the extent of exploratory behavior during the game. Relative to liberals, politically conservative individuals pursued a more avoidant strategy to the game, which led to their development of a more pronounced valence asymmetry in learning and attitude formation.

AB  - Effects of a task complexity system and goal setting on performance of a computer-based game were investigated in 2 studies using a 3 × 2 × 2 design. In the 1st trial, college students (90 in Study 1 and 72 in Study 2) played the game under low, balanced, or high task complexity system conditions. In the 2nd trial, the same Ss either set performance goals or were told to do their best as they played the game. Balanced task complexity systems elicited active coping with task demands, and goal setting altered the Ss' patterns of autonomic (heart rate, respiratory rate, respiratory sinus arrhythmia) and behavioral responses. Across goal and task complexity system conditions, performance outcomes were consistent with patterns of autonomic response. When parasympathetic withdrawal was accompanied by sympathetic overbalance, performance was lower; when parasympathetic dominance was evident, performance was higher.

AB  - This editorial introduces the current issue of Journal of Media Psychology: Theories, Methods, and Applications. Readers will find reports on three original empirical studies, followed by one methods paper. Studies cover a range of topics, including: the effects of exposure to a computer game on arousal and subsequent task performance, the concern about offensive messages in hip hop/rap and rock, the concept of parasocial relationships and the affective disposition theory of drama in order to empirically examine suspense in watching sports events on television, and a German-language instrument for esthetic perception assessment in the visual arts together with some first results on the psychometric properties of the questionnaire.

AB  - In order to show the utility and validity of frontal midline theta rhythm (Fm-theta) and spontaneous blinking as new assessment tools for human factors from the standpoint of psychophysiology in ergonomics, 2 experiments were undertaken. In Exp 1, Fm-theta and eyeblink rates were measured in 10 Japanese abacus experts (AEs) and 10 normal students (NSs) during a visual search task with a video display terminal (VDT). Memory load affected all measures. The amount of Fm-theta appeared more in AEs than NSs, but blink rate was lower in AEs than in NSs. Exp 2 was done with 10 children (aged 8–12 yrs) during 3 visual tasks: video game, mental test, and watching animation. Amounts of Fm-theta and the degree of blink inhibition were maximum when playing the video game, which all Ss reported they most preferred, and the minimum while watching animation, which 8 Ss reported to be most boring. From these 2 experiments, Fm-theta and eyeblink rate appear to be good indices of attention concentration and task pleasantness of a mental task using VDT.

AB  - We adapted the computer game TETRIS to investigate the process of affective-motivational counter-regulation, that is, attentional biases for emotional stimuli that are in opposition to the momentary motivational focus. Counter-regulation is seen as a mechanism which should prevent escalation and impulsivity, and it should help to avoid becoming 'locked up' in affective-motivational states. Accordingly, for a negative outcome focus condition (i.e., risk of losing a current high score), we hypothesized greater interference by positive distractors that were included in the game, whereas for a positive outcome focus (i.e., chance to improve one’s current high score), we hypothesized greater interference by negative distractors. Supporting our hypotheses, we found the predicted interactions between distractor valence and type of outcome focus. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Attitude generalization was explored as a function of object similarity and attitude valence and extremity. Participants in a computer game formed attitudes toward positive and negative, mild or extreme stimuli. How well these attitudes generalized to similar, novel stimuli was then examined. Visual similarity to game targets affected categorization of novel stimuli, such that greater resemblance resulted in more similar classification. However, generalization varied by valence and extremity. Negative attitudes generalized more than positive attitudes, requiring less resemblance for a novel target to be classified as negative. This pattern was more obvious with extreme attitudes than mild attitudes. That is, extreme attitudes were more influential and given more weight than mild attitudes. Also, specific conditions were identified under which positive attitudes proved more influential than negative attitudes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study compared the skill and physiological demands of open- and closed-skill drills commonly used in Australian football. Junior male players (n=30, age 16.7 ± 0.5 y, height 1.88 ± 0.07 m, mass 79.7 ± 6.5 kg; mean ± SD) completed two different training sessions involving a series of three open and closed training drills. Movement demands were quantified with global positioning system (GPS) technology, while physiological responses were assessed with heart rate, blood lactate concentration and self-reported ratings of physical exertion. Skill demands were quantified by video analysis and self-reported ratings of perceived cognitive complexity. Two of the three open drills were substantially more demanding in terms of distance (metres) covered (p < .05), rating of perceived physical exertion (p < .05), and relative intensity (p < .05). All open drills had significantly more moderate velocity efforts (p < .05) than their closed counterparts. There were no differences in post-session lactate concentration between the drills or formats, but heart rate was higher in the open format for the third drill. Analysis of skill demands revealed that while the number of ball disposals were equivalent in two of the three open and closed drill formats, there was a significantly larger volume of game-like decisions required of the participants in all open drills. Higher cognitive complexity scores were reported in the open drills (p < .05). In conclusion, the open drills were generally more physically and cognitively demanding than the closed drills commonly used in Australian Football. Coaches and conditioning staff should prescribe open drills to elicit higher physical and cognitive training loads in a game-specific context.

AB  - This quasi-experimental study examined the effects of exposure to a computer game on arousal and subsequent task performance. After inducing a state of low arousal, participants were assigned to experimental or control conditions via self-selection. Members of the experimental group played a computer game for five minutes; subjects in the control group spent the same amount of time awaiting further instructions. Participants who were exposed to the computer game showed significantly higher levels of arousal and performed significantly better on a subsequent cognitive task. The pattern of results was not influenced by the participants' prior experience with the game. The findings indicate that mood-management processes associated with personal media use at the workplace go beyond the alteration of arousal and affect subsequent cognitive performance.

AB  - The popularity of computer games has exploded in recent years, yet methods of evaluating user emotional state during play experiences lag far behind. There are few methods of assessing emotional state, and even fewer methods of quantifying emotion during play. This paper presents a novel method for continuously modeling emotion using physiological data. A fuzzy logic model transformed four physiological signals into arousal and valence. A second fuzzy logic model transformed arousal and valence into five emotional states relevant to computer game play: boredom, challenge, excitement, frustration, and fun. Modeled emotions compared favorably with a manual approach, and the means were also evaluated with subjective self-reports, exhibiting the same trends as reported emotions for fun, boredom, and excitement. This approach provides a method for quantifying emotional states continuously during a play experience. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The main goal of this study was to evaluate immersion, along with presence and cybersickness, in a virtual test examination scenario. Sample consisted of 46 students (M = 22.96 years; SD = 5.04), with 12 men and 34 women that were exposed to a test anxiety virtual situation. The experimental setup consisted in 2 PCs, one for psychophysiological recording and the other for VR presentation with a Cybermind HiRes800 HMD. The virtual environment was a test situation in a classroom with a teacher and some students. During the virtual exam the participant had to mark the right answer to each question. Besides psychophysiological recordings, data was assessed by ITQ-F (Bouchard et al, 2002), PQ-F (Bouchard et al, 2002), SSQ-F (Robillard et al, 2003), RT (Sarason, 1984), STAI (Spielberger et al, 1983). The statistical analysis was performed through one sample t test, one way ANOVA's and multivariate ANOVA's. The descriptive analysis with the normative data of previous studies revealed an increase in the level of cybersickness and a lower level of presence. However, for immersion higher values were registered when compared to normative data reported in literature. Between genders was observed significant statistical differences for BPM (F(1;41) = 11.05; p < .01), with higher levels of psychophysiological activation for women. The same analysis revealed significant statistical differences for Immersion (F(1;44) = 8.99; p < .01) and Presence (F(1;39) = 6.45; p < .05), indicating higher scores for men. The psychophysiological parameter (BPM) was influenced also by the subject's computer experience (F(3;39) - 4.19; p < .05) indicating more activation for subjects with less experience. A comparison between frequency of playing computer games also results in a significant increase in Immersion (F(3;40) = 4.55; p < .01). (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study investigated the effects of video game play on aggression. Using the General Aggression Model, as applied to video games by Anderson and Bushman, (2002) this study measured physiological arousal, state hostility, and how aggressively participants would respond to three hypothetical scenarios. In addition, this study measured each of these variables multiple times to gauge how aggression would change with increased video game play. Results showed a significant increase from baseline in hostility and aggression (based on two of the three story stems), which is consistent with the General Aggression Model. This study adds to the existing literature on video games and aggression by showing that increased play of a violent first person shooter video game can significantly increase aggression from baseline.

AB  - Determined the relationship between heightened reactivity of blood pressure (BP) and 5-yr changes in BP and hypertensive status using the CARDIA study. 910 white men, 909 white women, 68 black men, and 867 black women, initially 20 to 32 yrs old, served as Ss. Cardiovascular reactivity to psychological stressors (video game and star-tracing tasks for 3 min, cold pressor test for 1 min) were measured. The authors then examined reactivity as a preditor of significant BP change over the next 5 yrs. Significant BP change and the development of hypertension over the 5-yr follow-up were examines in separate analyses. Increased systolic BP reactivity to the video game was associated with a significant 5-yr systolic BP increase among the entire cohort. This relationship held for men but not for women. Among black men only, new hypertensives had greater diastolic BP reactivity to the video game. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Noting that the social and emotional experiences of American children today often heavily involve electronic media, Barbara Wilson takes a close look at how exposure to screen media affects children’s well-being and development. She concludes that media influence on children depends more on the type of content that children find attractive than on the sheer amount of time they spend in front of the screen. Wilson begins by reviewing evidence on the link between media and children’s emotions. She points out that children can learn about the nature and causes of different emotions from watching the emotional experiences of media characters and that they often experience empathy with those characters. Although research on the long-term effects of media exposure on children’s emotional skill development is limited, a good deal of evidence shows that media exposure can contribute to children’s fears and anxieties. Both fictional and news programming can cause lasting emotional upset, though the themes that upset children differ according to a child’s age. Wilson also explores how media exposure affects children’s social development. Strong evidence shows that violent television programming contributes to children’s aggressive behavior. And a growing body of work indicates that playing violent video games can have the same harmful effect. Yet if children spend time with educational programs and situation comedies targeted to youth, media exposure can have more prosocial effects by increasing children’s altruism, cooperation, and even tolerance for others. Wilson also shows that children’s susceptibility to media influence can vary according to their gender, their age, how realistic they perceive the media to be, and how much they identify with characters and people on the screen. She concludes with guidelines to help parents enhance the positive effects of the media while minimizing the risks associated with certain types of content.

AB  - Autonomous synthetic characters have the potential to promote the social engagement of users in virtual environments, thus enhancing their interaction experience. This effect is supported by the interactions between users and synthetic characters perform together, which are often in group scenarios. However, for these group interactions to be successful, it is not enough to assure that the characters behave in a coherent manner from an individual perspective, but it is also necessary that they exhibit behaviours that are coherent with the group's composition, context and structure. Therefore, we have developed a model to support group dynamics of autonomous synthetic characters (SGD Model), inspired in theories developed in human social psychological sciences, that define the knowledge that each individual should build about the others and the group, and how this knowledge drives their interactions. This model was used to drive the behaviour of characters in a collaborative computer game that was used in an experiment that showed that the SGD Model had a positive effect on the users' social engagement, namely on their trust and identification with the group.

AB  - Reports an error in 'The role of human-automation consensus in multiple unmanned vehicle scheduling' by M.L. Cummings, Andrew Clare and Christin Hart (Human Factors, 2010[Feb], Vol 52[1], 17-27). In the February 2010 print issue of Human Factors, Figures 1 (page 19) and 2 (page 20) were erroneously printed in black and white. The color images are included here. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2010-13780-002[/rid].) Objective: This study examined the impact of increasing automation replanning rates on operator performance and workload when supervising a decentralized network of heterogeneous unmanned vehicles. Background: Futuristic unmanned vehicles systems will invert the operator-to-vehicle ratio so that one operator can control multiple dissimilar vehicles connected through a decentralized network. Significant human-automation collaboration will be needed because of automation brittleness, but such collaboration could cause high workload. Method: Three increasing levels of replanning were tested on an existing multiple unmanned vehicle simulation environment that leverages decentralized algorithms for vehicle routing and task allocation in conjunction with human supervision. Results: Rapid replanning can cause high operator workload, ultimately resulting in poorer overall system performance. Poor performance was associated with a lack of operator consensus for when to accept the automation’s suggested prompts for new plan consideration as well as negative attitudes toward unmanned aerial vehicles in general. Participants with video game experience tended to collaborate more with the automation, which resulted in better performance. Conclusion: In decentralized unmanned vehicle networks, operators who ignore the automation’s requests for new plan consideration and impose rapid replans both increase their own workload and reduce the ability of the vehicle network to operate at its maximum capacity. Application: These findings have implications for personnel selection and training for futuristic systems involving human collaboration with decentralized algorithms embedded in networks of autonomous systems.

AB  - These two studies investigated the influence of dispositional locus of control (LOC) on subjective and physiological responses to a novel laboratory stressor task. Across two studies, 64 healthy undergraduate students, ages 18-22, completed Levenson's (LOC) scales for internal, powerful others, and chance prior to performing a video-game task. Participants rated pretask and posttask stressfulness and coping ability (i.e., measures of primary and secondary appraisal). Cardiovascular measures (heart period, HP; preejection period, PEP; respiratory sinus arrhythmia, RSA; cardiac output, CO; systolic blood pressure, SBP; diastolic blood pressure, DBP & total peripheral resistance, TPR) were recorded during 4-minute baseline and 4-minute stressor task periods. The internal LOC factor predicted pretask reports of coping ability as well as posttask reports of stressfulness. In contrast, the powerful-others LOC factor predicted cardiac changes (HP, PEP, and RSA) during the task but not cardiac output or any other vascular change measure. These results underscore the importance of using the three subscales of the Levenson LOC to assess relationships between dispositional LOC and the response to stressors because self-reported appraisals of a task are predicted by a different component of dispositional LOC than are task-related cardiovascular functions.

AB  - This pilot study explores the use of combining multiple data sources (subjective, physical, physiological, and eye tracking) in understanding user cost and behavior. Specifically, we show the efficacy of such objective measurements as heart rate variability (HRV), and pupillary response in evaluating user cost in game environments, along with subjective techniques, and investigate eye and hand behavior at various levels of user cost. In addition, a method for evaluating task performance at the micro-level is developed by combining eye and hand data. Four findings indicate the great potential value of combining multiple data sources to evaluate interaction: first, spectral analysis of HRV in the low frequency band shows significant sensitivity to changes in user cost, modulated by game difficulty--the result is consistent with subjective ratings, but pupillary response fails to accord with user cost in this game environment; second, eye saccades seem to be more sensitive to user cost changes than eye fixation number and duration, or scanpath length; third, a composite index based on eye and hand movements is developed, and it shows more sensitivity to user cost changes than a single eye or hand measurement; finally, timeline analysis of the ratio of eye fixations to mouse clicks demonstrates task performance changes and learning effects over time. We conclude that combining multiple data sources has a valuable role in human-computer interaction (HCI) evaluation and design. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - An approach for capturing and modeling individual entertainment ('fun') preferences is applied to users of the innovative Playware playground, an interactive physical playground inspired by computer games, in this study. The goal is to construct, using representative statistics computed from children's physiological signals, an estimator of the degree to which games provided by the playground engage the players. For this purpose children's heart rate (HR) signals, and their expressed preferences of how much 'fun' particular game variants are, are obtained from experiments using games implemented on the Playware playground. A comprehensive statistical analysis shows that children's reported entertainment preferences correlate well with specific features of the HR signal. Neuro-evolution techniques combined with feature set selection methods permit the construction of user models that predict reported entertainment preferences given HR features. These models are expressed as artificial neural networks and are demonstrated and evaluated on two Playware games and two control tasks requiring physical activity. The best network is able to correctly match expressed preferences in 64% of cases on previously unseen data (p-value 6 • 10-5). The generality of the methodology, its limitations, its usability as a real-time feedback mechanism for entertainment augmentation and as a validation tool are discussed.

AB  - The ability to work with new information and communication technologies and apply new clinical interventions arising from systems neuroscience may enable psychiatry to take a position of leadership in future medical practices. Replacing home telephone lines and television cable connections with optical fiber, a strategy that is currently being vigorously pursued for commercial purposes, will solve the 'last mile' problem of giving people convenient ultra-high-speed Internet connections for entertainment, online games, home offices, distance education, video communication with friends and family, and medical care. Psychiatry is poised to expand its purview to embrace the gamut of communication functions in medical care, while deepening its involvement with neurophysiology aspects of mental health care. The movement of psychiatry from the periphery to the center of medical practice will be effected in part by adoption of technology, particularly methodology that promotes communication and assists in interpreting psychophysiological states. A clinic that specializes in the treatment of aging patients may be the optimal setting in which to explore and develop practice structures that can ultimately be extended to health care in general.

AB  - The autonomic characteristics of hostility and defensiveness were assessed in 55 male undergraduates based on composite Cook Medley Hostility (Chost) and Marlowe Crowne Social Desirability (MC) scores to create 4 groups: Defensive Hostile (DH; high MC, high Chost), High Hostile (HH; low MC, high Chost), Defensive (Def; high MC, low Chost) and Low Hostile (LH; low MC, low Chost). All subjects engaged in a video game (VG) and hand cold pressor (CP) task. Cardiovascular responses in DH subjects were predicted to show enhanced sympathetic α and β-adrenergic activity and the least vagal control compared to others across tasks. DH and LH men showed significant heart rate reactivity to the CP task compared to HH men. LH men showed significant reductions in high frequency power (vagal assessment) to the tasks compared to HH men. Future studies may employ harassment techniques and include the factors of gender and ethnicity in their assessments. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Comments on an article by John W. Burns et al (see record [rid]2009-21474-014[/rid]). The study by Burns and colleagues in this issue of PAIN examines the role of opioids in the relationship between negative emotion and pain. Anger was experimentally induced in healthy participants by means of a frustrating video game that involved the 'help' of an antagonizing study confederate that harassed the participant during game play. I concur with Burns and colleagues that it will be important for future research to determine whether their results are due to anger specifically, or negative affect generally. Most experimental procedures intended to induce specific emotions often evoke a wide range of negative affect. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - [Correction Notice: An erratum for this article was reported in Vol 49(8) of Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry (see record [rid]2008-10839-014[/rid]). The following errors occured in the article: On Page 743, line 9: (ASDs) has been published incorrectly as (Asbs). On Page 744, line 32: 'hypotheses' has been published incorrectly has 'hypothesis'. In line 52: 'skill generalization' has been published incorrectly as 'skills generalization'. On Page 752, line 44: Appendix A: Session 6, Teacher handout recommendations: 'pro-social' has been published incorrectly as 'pre-social'.] Background: The study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a new multi-component social skills intervention for children with Asperger syndrome (AS): The Junior Detective Training Program. This 7-week program included a computer game, small group sessions, parent training sessions and teacher handouts. Method: Forty-nine children with AS were recruited to participate and randomly assigned to intervention (n = 26) or wait-list control (n = 23) conditions. Results: Relative to children in the waitlist group, program participants showed greater improvements in social skills over the course of the intervention, as indicated by parent-report measures. Teacher-report data also confirmed that children receiving the intervention made significant improvements in social functioning from pre- to posttreatment. Treatment group participants were better able to suggest appropriate emotion-management strategies for story characters at post-intervention than at pre-intervention, whereas control participants were not. However, there was no difference in the improvements made by children in the intervention and control conditions on facial expression and body-posture recognition measures. Follow-up data suggested that treatment gains were maintained by children at 5-months post-intervention. Conclusions: The Junior Detective Training Program appeared to be effective in enhancing the social skills and emotional understanding of children with AS. Limitations and suggestions for future research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Studied psychophysiological responses to breathing control or progressive muscular relaxation techniques. Human Ss: 18 normal male and female Spanish adults (university students). Psychophysiological measurements were obtained prior to training, during training sessions, and at 5 wks after training. Training sessions consisted of specific instructions about either breathing control or progressive muscular relaxation. Ss also participated in mental arithmetic and video games during training sessions. The results were evaluated according to changes in frontal EMG, peripheral temperature of right ring finger, electrodermogram of index and middle fingers, heart rate, pulse volume, and respiration rate. A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and other statistical tests were used. (English abstract) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study examined children's spontaneous use of behavioral emotion regulation (ER) strategies and their effects on subsequent mood change in response to an in vivo peer rejection manipulation. Participants (N = 186), ranging between 10 and 13 years of age, played a computer game based on the television show Survivor and were randomized to either peer rejection (being voted out of the game) or nonrejection control. In response to rejection, more than one third of the participants (38%) displayed a marked worsening (i.e., reliable change) in state mood. After receiving feedback, time spent on several behavioral ER strategies during a 5-minute postfeedback period was assessed. At the end of the postfeedback period, children's cognitive activity was also assessed. More time spent on behavioral distraction was positively linked to subsequent increases in positive affect, whereas the reverse pattern was found for disengagement/passive behavior. Moreover, higher endorsement ratings for the strategy of 'cognitive analysis' were associated with stronger increases in negative affect. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The incident of visually induced motion sickness (VIMS) occurred with a 20-min video movie during class in a local junior high school in Japan in 2003. To investigate possibly contributing factors of VIMS, we collected the incident data in three ways: interviewing school officials, measuring the visual environment on site, and surveying by questionnaires to the students. Analyzing the collected data showed that the students' severities of the sickness related with their viewing distance to the video image, their concentrations on the video movie, their getting a cold, and their daily playing hours of video games. The results indicated that individual differences are determined not only by one factor, like autonomic nervous activity often focused in the literature, but also by combinations of other personal factors, such as health conditions, watching attitudes, and daily play activities.

AB  - There is continuing debate on the extent of the effects of media violence on children and young people, and how to investigate these effects. The aim of this review is to consider the research evidence from a public-health perspective. A search of published work revealed five meta-analytic reviews and one quasi-systematic review, all of which were from North America. There is consistent evidence that violent imagery in television, film and video, and computer games has substantial short-term effects on arousal, thoughts, and emotions, increasing the likelihood of aggressive or fearful behaviour in younger children, especially in boys. The evidence becomes inconsistent when considering older children and teenagers, and long-term outcomes for all ages. The multifactorial nature of aggression is emphasised, together with the methodological difficulties of showing causation. Nevertheless, a small but significant association is shown in the research, with an effect size that has a substantial effect on public health. By contrast, only weak evidence from correlation studies links media violence directly to crime. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded while the subjects played a video game where the player had to steer a monkey into a goal while collecting bananas for extra points and had to avoid falling off the edge of the game board. Each of these three studied events evoked differential EEG oscillatory changes. Picking up bananas evoked decreased theta activation on central electrodes, decreased high alpha activation on frontal electrodes, and increased beta activation on frontal electrodes. Falling off the game board evoked decreased central theta activation and increased fronto-central beta activation. Reaching the goal evoked increased theta activation on parietal electrodes, increased low alpha activation on frontal electrodes, increased high alpha activation on frontal, central, and parietal electrodes, and increased beta activation on frontal and central electrodes. It is suggested that the EEG oscillations evoked by picking up bananas reflect increased cortical activation and arousal; the oscillations evoked by falling off the edge of the game board reflect motor functions; and the oscillations evoked by reaching the goal reflect a relaxed state. Thus, EEG may turn out to be a valuable tool when examining psychological responses to video game events. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - At present, little is known about why subjective time loss occurs whilst playing video games other than that it may relate to features of escape, immersion and arousal—all of which have been implicated in the development of addictive behaviours. This study examined subjective time loss of 40 undergraduate students (26 males and 14 females with a mean age of 21.4 years) whilst playing one of two video games in an experimental setting. Mood state before and after game playing was also examined using the Profile of Mood States—Short Form (POMS-SF, Grove & Prapavessis, 1992). Results found that, females significantly underestimated the time that they were playing compared to males. Total Mood Disturbance increased after playing one of the games, but only for participants who reported that they would liked to have continued playing for longer. There were no gender differences in relation to mood state. It is concluded that time loss is not (in itself) a precipitating or facilitating factor relating to addictive behaviour patterns.

AB  - As the products of modern science, the effects of video games on children and adolescents drew the attention of psychologists. Anderson and Bushman proposed the General Aggressive Model, which could explain both the development of aggressive behavior and the difference of individual vulnerability to the effects of violent video games, and they advocated the effects, including short-term effects and long-term effects. Many researches about the relation of violent video games and aggression reported five consistent results: exposure to violent video games increased aggressive behavior, cognition, affect and physiological arousal, and decreased helping behavior. The positive intervention of parents can decrease negative effects of video games. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Research on the reliability of cardiovascular reactivity has focused on temporal stability and intertask consistency with only modest results. The present study evaluated the internal consistency reliability of cardiovascular reactivity in three large samples of adolescents and young adults (N = 326, 136, and 142). Impedance cardiographic and blood pressure measures were recorded at rest and during standard laboratory stress tasks (math, video game, cold pressor). The reliability of cardiovascular reactivity within tasks, as assessed by Cronbach's α coefficient of internal consistency, ranged from α = .83 to .96 for 4-min to 5-min math tasks, and α = .65 to .94 for 3-min video game and cold pressor tasks. Although highly reliable within tasks, cardiovascular reactivity was less reliable across tasks, even within a single testing session. Possible reasons for the discrepancy between internal consistency and intertask consistency are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Recent studies on video game playing have uncovered a wide range of measurable physiological effects on the organism, such as increases in cardiovascular activity and breathing responses. However, the exact source of these effects remains unclear. Given the well-known effects of sound on physiological activity, especially those of noise and of music, and on the secretion of the stress hormone cortisol in particular, we hypothesized that music may be a major source of stress during video game playing. We thus examined the effect of built-in music on cortisol secretion as a consequence of video game playing. Players were assigned quasi-randomly to either a Music or a Silence condition. Four saliva samples were taken, that is, after practice (T1), immediately after having played for 10 minutes (T2), 15 minutes after the end of the experiment (T3), and 30 minutes after the end of the experiment (T4). The results show that the Music group had significantly higher cortisol levels at T3, that is, when cortisol levels are assumed to reflect the stress induced by the game. These findings suggest for the first time that the auditory input contributes significantly to the stress response found during video game playing.

AB  - Compared blood pressure, heart rate, stroke volume, vascular resistance, and cardiac output responses to a video game challenge and forehead cold stressor in 195 boys (aged 6–15 yrs) who varied in ethnicity and family history of essential hypertension. Controlling for age, significant baseline differences were obtained with Black Ss exhibiting higher systolic and diastolic pressures than their White cohorts. Positive family history Ss were found to have higher cardiac outputs and stroke volumes indexed by body surface area during baseline. The positive family history Ss exhibited greater decreases in cardiac index during both the video game and cold stressor phases. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Wearable biosensors allow for the non-invasive collection of a range of biometric data. A better understanding of the physiologic corollaries of emotional and behavioral response patterns is promoting keen insight into the way the mind and body work in synchrony. Empirical research has already established significant findings related to psychophysiologic characteristics and individual performance. Similarly, groups may express unique biologic patterns or, a collective flow that is indicative of optimal group performance. Groups continuously modify based on the perpetual sharing and streaming of mutually relevant information. A group's idea formation, leadership, affect, cohesion, flow, motivation, efficacy and problem solving change in an ongoing system of reciprocity. This project establishes research into how group biometrics capture dynamic group processes, and identify psychophysiologic patterns associated with group performance. We hypothesize that there are patterns of group physiological change that can be detected through biometric data analysis; further, that these group rhythms reflect a dynamic interchange associated with group performance and group dynamics including cohesion, flow, and group efficacy. Using a nested mixed-model design, this study aims to evaluate group performance in a collaborative gaming environment within groups with variant performance levels. Thirty-three experienced computer game players were randomly assigned into 11 groups of three. Each team engaged in four one-hour sessions of collaborative, multi-player computer video game play (CounterStrike). Participants wore non-invasive sensors during game play, which allowed for the continuous collection of low-level physiological data. Follow-up questionnaires assessed individuals' perceptions of several characteristics associated with group dynamics. This article will provide descriptions of initial project outcomes and discuss implications of anticipated results related to leadership orientation, situational motivation, group efficacy, perceived cohesion, self-efficacy, and flow. Long-term plans include the application of findings to develop new strategies and intervention tools for better communications, dynamic interrelatedness, empathic performance, and transformative learning.

AB  - The present study examined the predictive validity of the Social Anxiety Scale for Children-Revised (SASC-R) by investigating associations between children's social anxiety symptoms and their cognitive and behavioral reactions in response to an in vivo peer evaluation manipulation. Participants (N = 115) ages 10-13, played a computer game based on the television show Survivor and were randomized to either a peer rejection (i.e., receiving the lowest total 'likeability' score from a group of peer-judges), a peer success (i.e., receiving the highest score), or a neutral peer feedback condition. Children reporting higher levels of social anxiety displayed more negative game-relevant performance expectations as well as more negative cognitive evaluations of both success and failure feedback. Moreover, regardless of feedback valence, children scoring higher on social anxiety reported greater reluctance to engage in game-related social activities. These findings provide support for the predictive validity of the SASC-R. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Experiments on the effects of video games on breathing patterns have led to contradictory results. Several studies have reported that video games increased breathing frequency (e.g., J. R. Turner and D. Carroll, 1985), whereas others reported the opposite (e.g., S. B. Miller and B. Ditto, 1988). It was postulated that video games contain different psychophysiological components which may have opposite effects on breathing. On one hand, arousal and emotion may tend to stimulate breathing. On the other, focusing attention on the game may prompt Ss to inhibit any movement, including breathing. The aim of this study was to assess the specific effects of the attentional load in an experimental environment characterized by its low emotional impact. Breathing variables, cardiac frequency, and cortisol levels were measured in 10 healthy children (mean age 9.2 yrs) who were familiar with the environment, the experimenter, and the video game. Breath duration rose significantly as a function of game difficulty. Cortisol levels, heart rate, and the thoracic contribution to breathing displayed no changes. Findings suggest that focusing attention on the game tended to inhibit breathing and that previous contradictory reports were due to the confounding effects of emotion.

AB  - Research on multiparty negotiation has investigated how parties form coalitions to secure payoffs but has not addressed how emotions may affect such coalition decisions. Extending research on bilateral negotiations which has generally argued that it is beneficial to communicate anger, we argue that it constitutes a considerable risk when there are more than two people present at the negotiation table. Using a computer-mediated coalition game we show that communicating anger is a risky strategy in multiparty bargaining. The main findings of three studies were that participants: (1) form negative impressions of players who communicate anger and therefore (2) exclude such players from coalitions and from obtaining a payoff share, but (3) make considerable concessions on those rare occasions that they choose to form a coalition with an angry player, or (4) when they had to form a coalition with an angry player. We discuss the implications of these results for theorizing on emotions, negotiations, and coalition formation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The possibilities of biofeedback training for improvement of the self-control of the functional state (relaxation) were studied in 9- to 10-year-old children. At the first stage, under conditions of electrophysiological experiment, relaxation shifts were assessed in the cycle quiet wakefulness-relaxation-recovery of the initial state by autonomic (skin resistance) and EEG (spectra and coherence) indices. The children were then trained to control their functional state with a computer game including a feedback loop by skin temperature. After the training cycle, children were repeatedly examined in electrophysiological experiment with the instruction to control their state. A correlation was found between the efficiency of self-regulation training and some individual psychophysiological characteristics (simple motor reaction time, autonomic coefficient, resting EEG). Low efficiency of self-control training was observed in younger schoolchildren with a sharply deviant (from the mean group values) reaction time and autonomic coefficient, as well as with EEG manifestations of functional immaturity of the upper brain regulatory structures. The dependence of the EEG changes on the self-regulation strategy is discussed on the basis of obtained evidence and data in the literature.

AB  - The first aim for this paper was to examine gender and age differences in the intensity of usage of information and communication technology (ICT: computer for digital playing, writing and e-mailing and communication, and Internet surfing, and mobile phone). Second, we modelled the possible mediating role of sleeping habits and waking-time tiredness in the association between ICT usage and perceived health (health complaints, musculoskeletal symptoms, health status). The participants were 7292 Finns aged 12, 14, 16 and 18 years responding to a postal enquiry (response rate 70%). The results showed that boys played digital games and used Internet more often than girls, whose mobile phone usage was more intensive. Structural equation model analyses substantiated the mediating hypothesis: intensive ICT-usage was associated with poor perceived health particularly or only when it negatively affected sleeping habits, which in turn was associated with increased waking-time tiredness. The associations were gender-specific especially among older adolescents (16- and 18-year olds). Intensive computer usage forms a risk for boys', and intensive mobile phone usage for girls' perceived health through the mediating links. Girls were vulnerable to the negative consequences of intensive mobile phone usage, as it associated with perceived health complaints and musculoskeletal symptoms both directly and through deteriorated sleep and increased waking-time tiredness. The results of gender-specific ICT usage and vulnerability are discussed as reflecting gendered psychophysiological, psychological and social developmental demands.

AB  - War veterans with neuromuscularskeletal injury often require significant treatment and rehabilitation, straining health care resources. In a study funded by the Office of Naval Research and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Virtual Reality Medical Center is applying virtual reality (VR) therapy to injured military personnel at the Naval Medical Center San Diego. The goal of this study is to investigate whether augmenting traditional rehabilitation with VR (in this case, off-the-shelf interactive video games) will enable a more rapid and complete rehabilitation. Because VR is interactive and encourages patients to use the entire body to reach goals in the game, VR may make the rehabilitation sessions more comfortable and entertaining. The participants consist of 20 veterans with upper arm and shoulder injuries (rotator cuff tear, shoulder impingement, bursitis). The participants were divided into two groups (n = 10): an experimental group, which would receive traditional rehabilitation augmented by virtual reality therapy, and a control group, which would undergo traditional rehabilitation. The participants will complete ten treatment sessions in their respective condition. Although the study has not yet been completed, preliminary results based on subjective questionnaires and functional capacity indicate that the experimental condition can elicit increased heart rate and respiration. The participants in this group also seem to enjoy the music and interaction made possible through VR. The results suggest that VR can enhance the rehabilitation process, creating a more effective form of treatment. The long-term benefits of this form of treatment may include improved treatment time and reduced drop-out rates, therefore reducing the costs of rehabilitation.

AB  - Four studies apply self-determination theory (SDT; Ryan & Deci, 2000) in investigating motivation for computer game play, and the effects of game play on wellbeing. Studies 1-3 examine individuals playing 1, 2 and 4 games, respectively and show that perceived in-game autonomy and competence are associated with game enjoyment, preferences, and changes in well-being pre- to post-play. Competence and autonomy perceptions are also related to the intuitive nature of game controls, and the sense of presence or immersion in participants' game play experiences. Study 4 surveys an on-line community with experience in multiplayer games. Results show that SDT's theorized needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness independently predict enjoyment and future game play. The SDT model is also compared with Yee's (2005) motivation taxonomy of game play motivations. Results are discussed in terms of the relatively unexplored landscape of human motivation within virtual worlds. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Based on neuroscience research, the PETTLEP model was developed by Holmes and Collins (2001). The model provides imagery guidelines which identify seven key factors (physical, environment, task, timing, learning, emotion, perspective) that should be included when developing interventions to maximise functional equivalence. This study explored the effect of a short-term PETTLEP imagery intervention, compared to ‘traditional’ imagery, on a computer game: Need for Speed Underground 2 (EA games). Eighty participants were randomly assigned to one of four groups: PETTLEP imagery group, ‘traditional’ imagery group, physical practice group and control group. After three practice attempts, pre-tests consisted of five attempts at the game. The game involved completing timed laps by manoeuvring a vehicle around a track using the computer’s arrow keys. The PETTLEP group completed individualised response training, and then performed imagery sitting in front of the computer screen and repeatedly imaging themselves completing the task. The ‘traditional’ imagery group was sat in a separate room, given individualised stimulus training and instructed to relax and close their eyes during imagery. The physical practice group performed the actual task. Each intervention lasted for forty-five minutes, immediately followed by the post-test, which again consisted of five attempts at the game. A group x test ANOVA showed that the PETTLEP imagery group and physical practice group both improved significantly from pre-test to post-test (p<0.05). However, there was no significant difference in the magnitude of their improvements. The traditional imagery and control groups showed no increase in performance from pre-test to post-test (p>0.05). The results strongly support the use of PETTLEP in enhancing performance on a cognitive task. Contrary to previous studies, PETTLEP was as effective as physical practice. This finding could have important implications for athletes returning from injury, suffering from over-training and for use in pre-performance routines. Therefore, sports psychologists should maximise the functional equivalence of their imagery interventions to have the greatest positive effect on performance on such cognitive tasks, at least in the short term. Future research needs to focus on applying short-term PETTLEP interventions to different tasks, varying in cognitive complexity. Assessing the effectiveness of PETTLEP imagery used in various combinations with physical practice would also be a useful addition to the literature.

AB  - Artificial intelligence and intelligent agents are sources of synergy for simulation and computer-based games. They support striking realism of the physical environment and provide unique opportunities for learning and complex operations. This article's purpose is to explore the relationship of software agents to simulation and games. This includes agents with advanced cognitive abilities (introspection, perception, anticipation, and understanding) as well as those representing personality, emotion, and cultural aspects of individuals and societies including issues. A recent special issue of Simulation: Transactions of the Society for Modeling and Simulation International on agent-directed simulation (ADS) is introduced. As a prelude to its presentation, the promising synergy of artificial intelligence, simulation, and gaming is elaborated on. A unifying paradigm for the synergy of agents and simulation and gaming--namely, ADS--is presented. It includes agent simulation, agent-supported simulation, and agent-based simulation. Also, two different usages of the term agent-based simulation are clarified. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The PackBots being used by the U.S. military in Afghanistan and the urban search and rescue (USAR) robots that worked the World Trade Center site are just two recent examples of mobile robots moving from the laboratory to the field. What is significant about these new applications is that they invariably involve some form of human-robot interaction (HRI) rather than the full robot autonomy that has motivated most prior research. Conducting HRI research can be extremely difficult because experimentation with physical robots is expensive and time consuming. Few roboticists have experience or interest in conducting human experimentation, and researchers in human factors or human-computer interaction often lack experience in programming robots or access to robotic platforms. In this paper, we describe a high-fidelity, open-source simulation intended for HRI researchers of varying backgrounds and provide reference tasks and environments to facilitate collaboration in order to share the results. The architecture and capabilities of the game engine–based USARSim simulation are described. Its use for HRI research is illustrated through case studies describing experiments in camera control for remote viewing and integrated display of attitude information.

AB  - Investigated the effects of background color and sound level on perceptions of computer games excitement and arousal levels. 96 individuals, primarily undergraduate students, completed questionnaires following playing a computer game with either a red or blue background color and loud or quiet musical sounds. Other collected data included game performance scores, errors, and heart rate. Results show that Ss using a blue screen improved gradually over the session, while players using a red screen peaked midway, then deteriorated. A similar pattern for heart rate was found, suggesting that arousal was implicated in the effect. Ss using a blue screen made more errors than those using a red screen. Sound alone had little impact, but the red–loud combination was associated with perceptions of excitement and playing well. Results suggest that background stimuli within a computer game affect cognitive and physiological responses, performance, and perceptions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The first generation of children to grow up with electronic toys and games saw computers as their 'nearest neighbors.' They spoke of computers as rational machines and of people as emotional machines, a fragile formulation destined to be challenged. By the mid-1990s, computational creatures, including robots, were presenting themselves as 'relational artifacts,' beings with feelings and needs. One consequence of this development is a crisis in authenticity in many quarters. In an increasing number of situations, people behave as though they no longer privilege authentic emotion. This paper examines watershed moments in the history of human-machine interaction, focusing on the implications of relational artifacts for our collective perception of aliveness and for human-to-human relationships. For now, the exploration of human-robot encounters leads us to questions about the human purposes of believable digital companions that are evocative but not authentic.

AB  - The purpose of the research was to examine the prevalence and interrelationships between sedentary and physical activity behaviors, and psychological determinants of physical activity among Singaporean school children. A sample of 1,935 children aged 10 to 14 years, took part in the study. In Study 1 (N = 780), physical activity and sedentary behaviors were assessed using a seven-day physical activity recall method. Three distinct clusters were found for each sex using cluster analysis. Thirty six percent of the boys spent much of their sedentary time in technology-based entertainment (e.g., computer/internet), and 38% of them reported substantial amount of time spent studying and doing homework. The rest of the boys spent their time being physically active but they were also substantially engaged in playing video games. Among the girls, time spent socializing with friends, studying, and engaging in physical activity amounted to 57.3%. Fifteen percent of the girls reported spending much of their time studying and doing homework. A group of girls (27.8%) reported little study time, little socialization, and low engagement in physical activity compared to their peers. In Study 2 (N = 1,155), three clusters were found using sport ability beliefs, perceived autonomy, and perceived competence as clustering variables. The amount of physical activity that the children took part in was influenced by their perceptions of competence, sport ability, and autonomy. The findings of the research showed that physical activity and sedentary behaviors were not inversely related. In addition, the studies confirmed that certain psychological determinants were important for examining the physical activity behaviors of Singaporean school children.

AB  - Using a deliberately slow computer game interface to induce a state of hypothesized frustration in users, the present study collected physiological, video and behavioral data, and developed a strategy for coupling these data with real-world events. The effectiveness of the strategy was tested in a study with 36 graduate and undergraduate students, where the system was shown to reliably synchronize and gather data for affect analysis. A pattern-recognition strategy known as Hidden Markov Models was applied to each subject's physiological signals of skin conductivity and blood volume pressure in an effort to see if regimes of likely frustration could be automatically discriminated from regimes when frustration was much less likely. This pattern-recognition approach performed significantly better than random guessing at classifying the 2 regimes. Mouse-clicking behavior was also synchronized to frustration-eliciting events and analyzed, revealing 4 distinct patterns of clicking responses. Recommendations and guidelines for using physiology as a dependent measure for human computer interface (HCI) experiments are provided, especially when considering human emotions in the HCI equation.

AB  - In this special issue, we focus on psychophysiological examinations of the interaction between the human and the machine. This special issue consists of two parts, although the boundary between the two parts is fluid. Some of the authors studied cardiac control during auditory or visual monitoring with visual-manual tracking. The goal of their study was to investigate the relationship between attention resource allocation and the activities of the sympathetic nervous system. Some of the other authors assess cognitive effects as reflected in brain activity. Some papers in this issue are related to ergonomics in the workplace. In this issue, computer simulation games and game-like tasks were assigned to the subjects in some papers. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Investigated the influences of both perceived control and physical effort on cardiovascular reactivity. 32 undergraduates (21 women) played a video game task interrupted by aversive noise. Perceived control of the noise was manipulated by instructions indicating the presence or absence of a contingency between performance and noise presentations. Physical effort was manipulated by controlling the physical force required to perform the task. There was a significant main effect of control on systolic blood pressure (SBP) and total peripheral resistance (TPR), with both increasing more during low than high control conditions. The results suggest that high perceived control over aversive noise in an effortful task reduces SBP and TPR reactivity relative to low perceived control. The results are consistent with the idea that control buffers the reactivity associated with task performance under aversive conditions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - We interpret early age-related developments in intentions and socially responsive behaviour with data from home videos of infants who later develop autism or Rett syndrome. Detailed evidence is given from a micro-analytic study of videos of monozygotic twin girls at 11 months, one of whom became autistic in the second year. Changes in this twin's attention, motor tonus, initiative and emotion reduce her prospective control of movements and her anticipations in awareness compared to her sister. These changes were reflected in the child's asynchronous social behaviour, which frustrated the father's attempts to support her attempts to walk, share toys, or play a game, confusing his anticipations, and this further reduced mutual attention and joint activity. Observations of the development of girls with Rett syndrome in the first year reveal changes in motor coordination, attention and communicative initiative, indicative of a failure of intrinsic core brain regulations of neural development and conscious activity. Notwithstanding that the two conditions show clear differences in both brain growth and early development of skills and sociability, the first signs of autism and Rett syndrome have important similarities. We conclude with recommendations for an approach to early diagnosis and treatment, applicable for the whole range of developmental brain disorders, including Rett syndrome and autism, that attempts to identify residual capacities for sympathetic motivation and collaborative learning--an approach that deliberately tries to support weakened rhythmic impulses for motor, perceptual and communicative functions in the growing infant brain.

AB  - This article presents a brief overview of existing research on the effects of exposure to violent video games. An updated meta-analysis reveals that exposure to violent video games is significantly linked to increases in aggressive behaviour, aggressive cognition, aggressive affect, and cardiovascular arousal, and to decreases in helping behaviour. Experimental studies reveal this linkage to be causal. Correlational studies reveal a linkage to serious, real-world types of aggression. Methodologically weaker studies yielded smaller effect sizes than methodologically stronger studies, suggesting that previous meta-analytic studies of violent video games underestimate the true magnitude of observed deleterious effects on behaviour, cognition, and affect.

AB  - Sensory stimuli become easier to detect or distinguish with practice. It is generally assumed that the task-relevant stimulus dimension becomes increasingly more salient as a result of attentively performing the task at a level that is neither too easy nor too difficult. However, here we show improved auditory frequency discrimination following training with physically identical tones that were impossible to discriminate. We also show that learning transfers across tone frequencies and across modalities: training on a silent visuospatial computer game improved thresholds on the auditory discrimination task. We suggest that three processes are necessary for optimal perceptual learning: sensitization through exposure to the stimulus, modality- and dimension-specific attention, and general arousal.

AB  - The increase in childhood obesity is partly attributable to an increasingly sedentary lifestyle and poor nutrition. Sedentary behaviors such as television viewing, computer use, and video game playing often replace vigorous physical activity in children. At the same time, more fast foods, convenience store snacks, and sweetened beverages are available now than in past generations. As parents, caregivers, teachers, mentors, public health leaders, and other concerned citizens, it is our responsibility to take immediate action to mitigate this serious and growing public health epidemic. We can and must work collaboratively, using available science and evidence of effective programs to ensure that our children receive encouragement and guidance to make healthful choices for physical activity and good nutrition. Optimally, we act as role models, with our own health behaviors promoting a healthful lifestyle by example. This will result in a public health movement that will not only help reduce the burden of childhood overweight and obesity, but also lessen the occurrence of other chronic diseases such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol.

AB  - Examined the influence of hypnotizability and absorption on psychological and autonomic responses to an experimental stressor and a relaxation procedure. 13 individuals (aged 20–38 yrs) completed the Harvard Group Scale of Hypnotic Susceptibility (R. E. Shor and E. C. Orne, 1962, HGSHS), the Brief Symptom Inventory (L. R. Derogatis and N. Melisaratos, 1983), and the Perceived Stress Scale (S. Cohen et al, 1983). Ss were classified as displaying high or low susceptibility to hypnosis based on HGSHS scores. Ss completed either a stress inducing task consisting of playing a computer game with mild electrical shocks for inaccurate performance or a relaxation task. Low-frequency and high-frequency heart rate components, representing sympathetic and parasympathetic reactivity, were measured during activities. Results show that absorption was found to be the only significant predictor of autonomic reactivity in both experimental conditions. Expectation and previous relaxation training, but not absorption or hypnotizability, predicted perceived relaxation in the relaxation condition. Findings suggest that in a nonhypnotic context the influence of hypnotizability on responses to experimental conditions may be less prominent than the influence of absorption.

AB  - Recent research suggests antitobacco advertising that elicits strong emotional arousal may be effective in prompting cessation. We examined response to a new graphic emotive advertisement about the smoking-related disease emphysema. We aimed to investigate the influence of the ad-induced interpersonal communication and the effect of television program viewing context. In a preexposure interview daily smokers (n = 205) were asked to watch a particular television program they usually watched. Post-exposure interviews examining recall and responses were conducted within two days of exposure. Over a quarter (26%) discussed the ad and these participants were more likely to be motivated to quit. Those who saw the television ad within a comedy program were less likely to believe the ad, whereas those who saw it during a reality TV/game show were more likely to discuss the ad and be motivated to quit smoking. These findings indicate that discussion of the ad with family and friends is associated with intentions to quit, our results also suggest there might be some value in placing graphic emotional ads within reality television or game show programs and in avoiding comedy programs.

AB  - Negativity biases, i.e., tendencies for negative features and interpretations to predominate over positive, are known to play a role in the etiology and maintenance of emotional disorders. Both depression and anxiety have been associated with such negative cognitive styles. Recently, Fazio, R.H., Eiser, J.R., and Shook, N.J. [(2004). Attitude formation through exploration: Valence asymmetries. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 87, 293-311] have observed similar valence asymmetries in the domain of attitude formation and generalization. The present research examined the possibility that the extent to which individuals display a learning bias in attitude formation is related to negative cognitive style and emotional disorder symptoms. Participants played a computer game that required learning whether novel stimuli produced positive or negative outcomes. Poorer learning was associated with more negative cognitive style, greater depression, and a tendency toward greater anxiety. Interestingly, these relations were most evident with respect to the learning of the positive stimuli, suggesting that an under-appreciation of positive objects and events may underlie vulnerability to emotional disorders. The potential value of various indices of negativity bias that can be assessed when examining attitude formation and generalization is discussed.

AB  - We present the self-paced 3-class Graz brain-computer interface (BCI) which is based on the detection of sensorimotor electroencephalogram (EEG) rhythms induced by motor imagery. Self-paced operation means that the BCI is able to determine whether the ongoing brain activity is intended as control signal (intentional control) or not (non-control state). The presented system is able to automatically reduce electrooculogram (EOG) artifacts, to detect electromyographic (EMG) activity, and uses only three bipolar EEG channels. Two applications are presented: the freeSpace virtual environment (VE) and the Brainloop interface. The freeSpace is a computer-game-like application where subjects have to navigate through the environment and collect coins by autonomously selecting navigation commands. Three subjects participated in these feedback experiments and each learned to navigate through the VE and collect coins. Two out of the three succeeded in collecting all three coins. The Brainloop interface provides an interface between the Graz-BCI and Google Earth. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Heart rate (HR), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP), and respiratory and metabolic activity were recorded prior to and during mental arithmetic and a video game task in 20 young men with mildly elevated casual systolic BPs. 25 unambiguously normotensive young men were tested under the same protocol. Ss with mildly elevated BP displayed significantly greater discrepancies between actual and predicted HR values than normotensives during the psychological tasks in general and mental arithmetic in particular. Group differences in physiological activity during exercise largely reflected the pattern seen at rest. Systolic BP levels were higher throughout the exercise phase for mildly elevated BP Ss and evidenced more of an increase from rest to exercise than the normotensives.

AB  - Objectives: The purpose of this study was to examine how variation in the beta-2 adrenergic receptor gene (ADRB2), in combination with the moderating influences of race, body mass index (BMI), and anger expression style (anger-in, anger-out), affects blood pressure (BP) at rest and in response to acute laboratory stress. Methods: Four hundred fifty adolescents (mean age = 18.5 ± 2.7 years; 228 [124 males] whites and 222 [110 males] blacks completed two stressors (video game challenge, forehead cold pressor). Hemodynamic measures were taken before, during, and after each stressor. Stressors were separated by a 20-minute rest period. Results: Frequency of detrimental haplotype (Gly16/Glu27) carrier status was greater among whites than blacks (p < .05). A significant three-way interaction among haplotype, BMI, and race for resting systolic blood pressure (SBP) found the highest BP level to be among high BMI carriers, but only for whites. A separate three-way interaction was found to be significant for haplotype, anger-in and race such that high anger-in carriers showed the highest level of resting SBP (p < .05) and total peripheral resistance (TPR) (p < .05) and the greatest TPR reactivity to the cold pressor task (p < .01). Post hoc analyses revealed these interactions with anger-in were only present among blacks. No significant interactions with anger-out for either ethnic group were observed. Conclusions: This study demonstrates modulating influences of BMI and anger expression styles on ADRB2 gene associations with hemodynamic function at rest and in response to laboratory stress. These findings support the hypothesis that consideration of gene-environment interactions may better characterize the role of ADRB2 variation in the development of stress-induced essential hypertension.

AB  - Examined the relationship between electrodermal activity (EDA) and anxiety in a failure and frustrative nonreward situation in 16 low trait anxiety (ANX) and 17 high ANX female college students. The game was presented as easy and as allowing a monetary gain. In fact, the game was faked and Ss never reached the criterion of success. High ANX Ss were in a higher state anxiety than low ANX Ss during the experiment. Though nonanxious Ss' skin conductance response amplitude was constant, this parameter decreased in anxious Ss as the game proceeded, suggesting EDA inhibition in the latter.

AB  - Aim: This paper reports a literature review examining factors that enhance retention of knowledge and skills during and after resuscitation training, in order to identify educational strategies that will optimize survival for victims of cardiopulmonary arrest. Background: Poor knowledge and skill retention following cardiopulmonary resuscitation training for nursing and medical staff has been documented over the past 20 years. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation training is mandatory for nursing staff and is important as nurses often discover the victims of in-hospital cardiac arrest. Many different methods of improving this retention have been devised and evaluated. However, the content and style of this training lack standardization. Method: A literature review was undertaken using the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, MEDLINE and British Nursing Index databases and the keywords 'cardiopulmonary resuscitation', 'basic life support', 'advanced life support' and 'training'. Papers published between 1992 and 2002 were obtained and their reference lists scrutinized to identify secondary references, of these the ones published within the same 10-year period were also included. Those published in the English language that identified strategies to enhance the acquisition or retention of Cardiopulmonary resuscitation skills and knowledge were included in the review. Results: One hundred and five primary and 157 secondary references were identified. Of these, 24 met the criteria and were included in the final literature sample. Four studies were found pertaining to cardiac arrest simulation, three to peer tuition, four to video self-instruction, three to the use of different resuscitation guidelines, three to computer-based learning programmes, two to voice-activated manikins, two to automated external defibrillators, one to self-instruction, one to gaming and the one to the use of action cards. Conclusions: Resuscitation training should be based on in-hospital scenarios and current evidence-based guidelines, including recognition of sick patients, and should be taught using simulations of a variety of cardiac arrest scenarios. This will ensure that the training reflects the potential situations that nurses may face in practice. Nurses in clinical areas, who rarely see cardiac arrests, should receive automated external defibrillation training and have access to defibrillators to prevent delays in resuscitation. Staff should be formally assessed using a manikin with a feedback mechanism or an expert instructor to ensure that chest compressions and ventilations are adequate at the time of training. Remedial training must be provided as often as required. Resuscitation training equipment should be made available at ward/unit level to allow self-study and practice to prevent deterioration between updates. Video self-instruction has been shown to improve competence in resuscitation. An in-hospital scenario-based video should be devised and tested to assess the efficacy of this medium in resuscitation training for nurses.

AB  - Three experiments examined the effects of rewarding and punishing violent actions in video games on later aggression-related variables. Participants played one of three versions of the same race-car video game: (a) a version in which all violence was rewarded, (b) a version in which all violence was punished, and (c) a nonviolent version. Participants were then measured for aggressive affect (Experiment 1), aggressive cognition (Experiment 2), and aggressive behavior (Experiment 3). Rewarding violent game actions increased hostile emotion, aggressive thinking, and aggressive behavior. Punishing violent actions increased hostile emotion, but did not increase aggressive thinking or aggressive behavior. Results suggest that games that reward violent actions can increase aggressive behavior by increasing aggressive thinking. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Reviews the book, The Advertised Mind: Ground-Breaking Insights into How Our Brains Respond to Advertising by Erik du Plessis and Millward Brown (2005). This book is a comprehensive, yet cohesive and coherent history of the understanding of the human brain, the human mind, and how it all relates to advertising and marketing. Du Plessis focuses on the processes of incidental learning, the type that occurs, for example, while watching a television advertisement. The book provides compelling cases and experiments that illustrate that learning has a lot to do with repetition, and that emotion is the starting point, not the end point. This is a radical 'game changer' for many advertising practitioners, and likely to be debated and (quite possibly) ignored for a time, as is often the case with paradigm shifts. Emotion in advertising is important in getting our attention. And what we pay attention to gets remembered. And what we have paid attention to and remembered in the past, makes us more likely to pay attention to in the future. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - 24 Ss, half of whom were PH+ (1 hypertensive parent), were exposed to 4 stressor tasks administered in counterbalanced order. Stressors were a cold pack to the forehead, isometric hand grip, a noxious film, and a shock-avoidance video game task. Physiological measures included heart rate (HR), respiration rate (RR), and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). RSA values were corrected for corresponding RR by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Familial differences in HR were observed in response to the hand grip and video game tasks. However, in both cases analyses suggest that familial differences in reactivity were a function of primarily sympathetic as opposed to parasympathetic influences. Familial differences in RSA were not observed for rest or tasks. This study found no evidence for parasympathetic mediation of familial differences in the HR response to the stressors employed.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to describe two social simulations created to assess leadership potential and train leaders to make effective decisions in turbulent environments. One is set in the novel environment of a lunar moon colony and the other is a military combat command. The research generated from these simulations for assessing the decision effectiveness of potential leaders with different personality traits and decision styles under varying degrees of information quantity, uncertainty and complexity is summarized. Opportunities and limitations of applying current computer assisted technology to social simulations for assessing and developing leaders' decision effectiveness in turbulent environments is discussed. Design/methodology/approach: College undergraduates and officer candidates in university ROTC programs made a series of decisions while being subjected to varying degrees of environmental turbulence in social simulations. The decision effectiveness of subjects with different personality characteristics under varying degrees of environmental turbulence was assessed through researcher observations, self-reports, and peer ratings. Findings: Social simulations are a cost effective way to assess and train leaders to make effective decisions in turbulent environments. The results of controlled experiments in social simulations have suggested that leaders with high levels of cognitive complexity and incongruity adaptation are more likely to be successful in highly turbulent environments than leaders with lower levels of incongruity adaptation ability and cognitive complexity who are more effective in more stable and structured situations. Research limitations/implications: The ease of modifying computer games renders them effective as low-cost virtual worlds that have relevance in military leadership experimentation. However, the use of computer simulations alone fails to capture the impact that relationships and emotions have on leader decision making, highlighting the continuing need for social simulations that include these interpersonal aspects of decision making. Practical implications: By participating in realistic social simulations, leaders can experiment with new decision styles without the risk of making real world mistakes that could jeopardize their own and their organization's future. The leaders who are most successful in adapting their decision style to the more complex requirements can be identified for promotion or assignment to appropriate settings. Originality/value: Both military and civilian organizations are in need of cost effective way to assess and train leaders to make effective decisions in turbulent environments. Social simulations provide a unique approach to meeting these needs and can simultaneously provide a venue for research in associated areas.

AB  - Epidemiological studies have shown that playing a computer game at night delays bedtime and shortens sleeping hours, but the effects on sleep architecture and quality have remained unclear. In the present study, the effects of playing a computer game and using a bright display on nocturnal sleep were examined in a laboratory. Seven male adults (24.7±5.6 years old) played exciting computer games with a bright display (game-BD) and a dark display (game-DD) and performed simple tasks with low mental load as a control condition in front of a BD (control-BD) and DD (control-DD) between 23:00 and 1:45 hours in randomized order and then went to bed at 2:00 hours and slept until 8:00 hours. Rectal temperature, electroencephalogram (EEG), heart rate and subjective sleepiness were recorded before sleep and a polysomnogram was recorded during sleep. Heart rate was significantly higher after playing games than after the control conditions, and it was also significantly higher after using the BD than after using the DD. Subjective sleepiness and relative theta power of EEG were significantly lower after playing games than after the control conditions. Sleep latency was significantly longer after playing games than after the control conditions. REM sleep was significantly shorter after the playing games than after the control conditions. No significant effects of either computer games or BD were found on slow-wave sleep. These results suggest that playing an exciting computer game affects sleep latency and REM sleep but that a bright display does not affect sleep variables.

AB  - To examine whether transfer of heart rate (HR) feedback training to tasks not used during training could be improved by using multiple tasks during training, a modified multiple baseline across tasks, single subject design study was conducted using six high HR-reactive young adults. Participants received HR feedback training during the presentation of a video game, and transfer of training was assessed to a mental arithmetic challenge and handgrip task. Transfer of training was next assessed following training with the mental arithmetic challenge and handgrip task. HR responses to each training task with no HR feedback were assessed during a pre-treatment session, an immediate post-training period following training on each task, a short delay (1-2 days) post-training session, and a long delay (1-2 weeks) post-training session. HR response to a novel speech task was assessed at pre-treatment and during short delay and long delay post-training sessions. Results revealed that participants reduced HR during training and generally maintained this reduction in HR during the immediate post-training assessment when HR feedback was not present. Participants were not able to reduce HR responses to tasks during short delay and long delay post-training sessions, and they were unable to transfer HR reduction skills to the speech task. Transfer of HR feedback training to new tasks was limited in nature and efforts to train across multiple stressors did not appear to improve transfer of training.

AB  - Examined environmental conditions for the psychophysiological assessment of the Cardiac Defense Response (CDR). 48 male students were divided into 4 groups in which the Adaptation Period and the Light Situation were manipulated. Ss took a test of the CDR to intense auditory stimulation under 1 of the 4 experimental conditions; they then completed a mental arithmetic task and played a competitive video game where only the light situation was manipulated. The experimental conditions of presence of light and short adaptation period negatively affected the CDR, but no effects were observed in the mental arithmetic or the competitive video game tasks. Results suggest that the effects of environmental light and adaptation period are not generalized to all tasks in such assessments, but that they do affect CDR.

AB  - Objective: To explore the personality traits, emotions, and cognitive factors related to the trends of computer game addiction and cyber-relationship addiction. Methods: 184 college students in Beijing filled up the following questionnaires, including Computer Game Addiction Inventory (CGAI). Internet Relationship Addiction Inventory (IRDI), Sensation Seeking Scale (SSS), Achievement Motivation Scale, Self-Esteem Scale (SES). Shame Scale, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-R Short Scale (EPQ-RSC), and cognition questionnaire developed by the authors. Results: (1) The trend of computer game addiction was positively correlated with sensation seeking, achievement motivation, the negative evaluation on oneself and environment in inter-personal relationships, and the positive evaluation on one's intelligence (P < 0.001). The correlation between the trend of computer game addiction and shame had also reached a statistics level of P < 0.05. (2) The trend of cyber-relationship addiction was found positively correlated with self-esteem, shame, and extroversion(P < 0.01), and negatively correlated with neurotism (P < 0.01). Conclusion: The causal factors and influences of these two addiction trends are different. The trend of computer game addiction showed more pathological and harmful effects on the functions of college students. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

Results: (1)The proportion of addicted undergraduate students is 14%, and the prevalence rate in males is higher than in females;(2) Among personal factors, the levels of emotion stability, toleration and duty of the addicted undergraduates were lower than non-addicted ones, and the difference of cognition and evaluation of the computer games between these two groups was significant;(3) Among environmental factors, the convenient conditions for playing computer games and the perception of study pressure were highly correlated with computer game addiction. Conclusion: Personality traits, cognition and evaluation of the computer games, convenient conditions for playing, and perception of study pressure are possible influential factors of the computer game addiction of undergraduates.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to evaluate the short-term effects on several physiological (arterial pressure and heart rate) and psychological (anxiety and aggressiveness) indexes of playing violent and non-violent videogames in young adults. The study was carried out on a sample of 22 male participants. Subjects invited to participate in the study were recruited from a videogame leisure club. Before and during playing either a violent or non-violent computer game, blood pressure and heart rate were measured. Before and after the game session, the subjects completed the State- Anxiety Inventory-Y (STAI-Y) and the Buss-Durkee Hostility Inventory. The results of the study showed a range of short-term effects of playing violent and non-violent videogames on arterial pressure and on the state anxiety of subjects, but not on hostility measurements. More specifically, the group that played the violent videogames showed a significant increase in the state anxiety score at the end of the game, as compared to the pre-game self-evaluation, and an increase in the systolic blood pressure while the subjects were playing as compared to pre- and post-game values. A decrease in diastolic blood pressure after playing any game was also found. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Computer modeling of personality and behavior is becoming increasingly important in many fields of computer science and psychology. Personality and emotion-driven Believable Agents are needed in areas like human-machine interfaces, electronic advertising and, most notably, electronic entertainment. Computer models of personality can help explain personality by illustrating its underlying structure and dynamics. This work presents a neural network model of personality and personality change. The goals are to help understand personality and create more realistic and believable characters for interactive video games. The model is based largely on trait theories of personality. Behavior in the model results from the interaction of three components: (1) personality--based predispositions for behaviour, (2) moods/emotions and (3) environmental situations. Personality develops gradually over time depending on the situations encountered. Modeling personality change produces interesting and believable virtual characters whose behaviors change in psychologically plausible ways.

AB  - Explored the potential effects of societal modernization on Samoan children's blood pressure (BP) and heart rate reactivity to a standardized TV video game procedure. 72 children (mean age 12.3 yrs) were sampled from Western Samoa, a relatively underdeveloped country with a largely agricultural economy, and 70 Ss (mean age 13.2 yrs) were sampled from American Samoa, a territory of the US that has undergone substantial modernization due to recent economic aid. Western Samoans demonstrated significantly greater systolic BP, diastolic BP, and heart rate reactivity than American Samoans. Data suggest that the hemodynamic effects of an acute stressor are inversely associated with societal modernization and an individual's adoption of a lifestyle reflecting integration into a modernized society.

AB  - Discusses the influence of media violence (MV) in youth. Research on violent (VT) television and films, video games, and music reveals unequivocal evidence that MV increases the likelihood of aggressive and VT behavior in both immediate and long-term contexts. The effects appear larger for milder than for more severe forms of aggression, but the effects on severe forms of VT are also substantial when compared with effects of other VT risk factors or medical effects deemed important by the medical community. The research is consistent in overall findings. The evidence is clearest within the most extensively researched domain, television and film VT. The growing body of video-game research yields essentially the same conclusions. Short-term exposure increases the likelihood of physically and verbally aggressive behavior, aggressive thoughts, and aggressive emotions. Recent large-scale longitudinal studies provide converging evidence linking frequent exposure to VT media in childhood with aggression later in life, including physical assaults and spouse abuse. Because extremely violent criminal behaviors are rare, new longitudinal studies with larger samples are needed to estimate accurately how much habitual childhood exposure to MV increases the risk for extreme violence.

AB  - Examined the effects of video lottery players' expectancies of winning on physiological and subjective arousal. Physiological measures were recorded as 34 occasional or regular video lottery players (aged 19-76 yrs) having either high or low winning expectancies played 100 video lottery games in a laboratory setting. Level of risk-taking was controlled. Low-expectancy Ss played for fun, therefore expecting to win worthless credits, while high-expectancy Ss played for real money. Ss' experience, demographic variables, and subjective arousal were assessed. Severity of problem gambling was measured with the South Oaks Gambling Screen. In order to measure arousal, the average heart rate was recorded across 8 periods. Results show that Ss exposed to high as compared to low expectations experienced faster heart rates prior to and during the gambling session. According to self-reports, it was the expectancy of winning money that was exciting, not playing the game. It is concluded that regardless of the level of risk-taking, expectancy of winning is a cognitive factor influencing levels of arousal. When playing for fun, gambling becomes significantly less stimulating than when playing for money. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In vivo exposure is a well-tested and effective treatment for anxious and phobic disorders. However, it is not viable to expose patients with War PTSD to real war environments. As virtual reality exposure (VRE) is currently the most approximate representation of a real war situation, we hypothesized that a treatments of War PTSD that included VRE along with Drug Treatment (DT) would be better than DT alone. The clinical population of this ongoing research consists of male subjects with the diagnostic of War PTSD according to DSM-IV-TR (APA, 2001) who looked for treatment at Hospital Julio de Matos in Lisbon, Portugal. The patients were distributed into 3 treatments groups (VRE; Drug treatment; VRE + Drug Treatment). The adequate therapeutic dosage of Sertraline (Zoloft, Pfeizer) will be administrated during 16 weeks to the Drug Treatment groups. VRE groups will use a Head Mounted Device that enables fully immersive experience in the following war virtual scenarios: mine deflagration, mine deflagration + ambush, ambush and assisting casualties and waiting for a rescue helicopter. These scenarios were developed using the most up-to-date video game graphics engine. It is also a goal of this study to compare different measurement procedures. In this way, CAPS, BDI, STAI, SCL-90, MCM-II for psychometric measures and TAS, DES, PQ, SUDS, heart rate and blood pressure, ECG, EEG and ACTH for physiological measures are the evaluation procedures selected for assessing the results.

AB  - Investigated the effects of manipulated arousal and the trait of Sensation Seeking on willingness to taste novel foods as assessed by a choice task. Arousal was manipulated by having Ss (aged 18–46 yrs) play an exciting, neutral, or boring video game. In line with predictions from optimal level of arousal theories, Ss chose more novel foods when manipulated arousal was low (vs neutral) and fewer novel foods when manipulated arousal was high (vs neutral). There was no main effect of individual differences in optimal level of arousal as assessed by the Sensation Seeking Scale; however, an interaction between the 2 independent variables revealed high-sensation seekers to try more novel foods than lows under conditions of low arousal.

AB  - Measured blood pressure (BP) and heart rate at rest and during a psychological stimulus (a video game procedure) in 477 children enrolled in 3rd grade; 62 Black and 370 White Ss had these measurements repeated a year later. Black Ss demonstrated greater BP and heart rate reactivity than did White Ss in both years and showed an increase in heart rate reactivity from 3rd to 4th grade. Systolic and diastolic BPs during the video game were more highly correlated from year-to-year than were the resting measures. Regression analysis indicate that systolic reactivity was significantly related to subsequent systolic BP at rest, particularly among Black girls. Diastolic reactivity was associated with subsequent resting diastolic BP only among White Ss. Associations between reactivity and future BP were independent of initial resting BP.

AB  - Autonomic and affective responses to children were assessed as a function of adult perceptions of interpersonal control. Women (N = 160) interacted with and provided feedback to computer-simulated children who behaved responsively or unresponsively on a computer game. Women were categorized as low in perceived control (PC) if they attributed high control to children but low control to self over negative events on the Parent Attribution Test. As predicted, low-PC women were maximally reactive to child characteristics, manifesting peak levels of defensive arousal (increased level of heart rate and electrodermal activity) and negative affect with unresponsive children and minimal levels of arousal and negative affect with responsive children. Intermediate response levels were shown by high-PC Ss. We interpreted results as suggesting mediating factors that may operate in dysfunctional interaction patterns previously found for low-PC caregivers.

AB  - This article proposes a theoretical explanation for the popularity of violent video games among adolescent male gamers. The author uses theories about media and emotion as well as theories about emotion as a process to develop a model for the unfolding of emotion in violent video games. It is argued that violent video games provide a gratifying context for the experience of emotions. The fact that gamers are largely in control of the game implies that they can voluntarily select the emotional situations they confront. This freedom is attractive for adolescents who are in the midst of constructing an identity. For them, the violent game is a safe, private laboratory where they can experience different emotions, including those that are controversial in ordinary life. Gamers may deliberately select emotions that sustain dominant masculine identity (e.g., anger), as well as emotions that are at odds with dominant masculinity (e.g., fear).

AB  - There is evidence that a stable physiological, cognitive, and behavioral pattern of responses can be identified when humans are under stress. The purpose of this paper was to identify a physiological response pattern when stress was induced by a video game. In the 1st condition Ss adapted to the laboratory situation and became familiar with the apparatus. During the 2nd condition Ss were instructed to relax. Finally, during the stress-inducing condition, Ss were asked to play a video game, which consisted of a car race. The electrography response, the heart rate, and the temperature of the Ss recorded during the 3 experimental phases. As expected, the electromyography response increased, heart rate increased, and temperature decreased during the stress-inducing condition, in comparison with these responses during adaptation and relaxation.

AB  - The effects of incentive on sustained attention and autonomic regulation among boys exposed in utero to opiates were studied. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), an indicator of autonomic regulation, was quantified during sustained attention in 3 groups of 7- to 12-year-old boys. RSA is a component of heart rate variability controlled by cortical influences and affected by changes in demand for attention. The Gordon Diagnostic System–Distractibility Task was performed with and without monetary reward. A cartoon task and a video game were used as measures of interest. Although opiate-exposed boys did not differ in performance as a function of incentive or interest, they had a tendency to perform more poorly overall across tasks. Alcohol exposure rather than opiate exposure covaried with autonomic regulation, with greater RSA decreases being associated with more alcohol exposure. Post hoc analyses revealed that the alcohol- and opiate-exposed boys responded with these hyperreactive RSA changes along with poorer performance.

AB  - Body-build peculiarities (49 body measurements) and psychophysiological properties (21 computerized tests) of 32 adolescent female volleyballers were studied to assess their significance in performance at competitions. Games were recorded by the original computer program Game, and an index of proficiency representative elements of the game was calculated for each player. Regression analysis was applied to predict the best psychophysiological and anthropometric models for serve, reception, block, feint, and attack. Seven tests of psychophysiological indices and 14 anthropometric variables explained 38-98% and 32-83% of skill performance, respectively. Consequently, to improve young volleyball players' performance, everyday coaching should be complemented by detailed assessment of their body build and psychophysiological characteristics.

AB  - What is the influence of the presentation of a model person on the recipient's domain-specific self-knowledge? In our experiment a model person engaged in an activity (playing a car-race computer game) that our participants had either engaged in before themselves (participants with domain specific self-knowledge) or not (participants without domain specific self-knowledge). We analysed the assimilation of participants' self-descriptions towards personal characteristics of the model. Results show that the degree of assimilation differed depending on if the person had acquired domain-specific self-knowledge before or not. Participants without relevant self-knowledge were more strongly influenced by the model person than participants with relevant self-knowledge. While model-sympathy did not have any influence on the assimilation-effect in the group of unexperienced participants, those who had developed a domain-specific self-concept before were more strongly influenced by a sympathetic model in comparison to a non-sympathetic model. This difference indicates different processing of information provided by a model person, depending on if the target person has already developed a relevant domain specific self-concept or not.

AB  - Reviews the book, Understanding the brain: The birth of a learning science (2007). Part 1 chapter describes basics of the brain and its various cognitive functions. How the brain learns throughout life is described is detailed. This part also describes how environmental factors, such as the emotions, physical exercise, attention, playing video games and sleep, can influence learning. This part also dispels neuromyths. In Part 2, there are a number of more detailed chapters on specific questions. These are tailored to the reader who wants to learn more about brain development and learning in different stages of life (early childhood, adolescence and adulthood). Throughout the book the latest research in each field is combined with the fundamental science. The writing is generally clear and entertaining and aimed at the interested non-specialist. There is a useful Glossary at end, and throughout there are diagrams to help the non-specialist reader to navigate the brain and its functions.

AB  - Background: Ineffective anger expression has been associated with essential hypertension (EH) and with blood pressure (BP) reactivity to stress. The ET-1/Lys198Asn polymorphism has been associated with increased resting BP and exaggerated vasoconstrictive mediated BP reactivity. African Americans (AAs) are at particular risk for development of EH, report greater anger difficulties, and exhibit greater vasoconstrictive reactivity than their European American (EA) counterparts. Purpose: The objective is to investigate a gene-environment model of stress reactivity in which anger expression, particularly in combination with ET-1 T allele carrier status and AA ethnicity, would be associated with the greatest vasoconstrictive reactivity in response to a behavioral stressor. Methods: One hundred ninety-one AA and 197 EA normotensive young adults (M age = 18.8 ± 2.5 years) participated in the study. Total peripheral resistance index (TPRI) reactivity was assessed during a 10-min video game challenge. Anger expression was measured using Spielberger's Anger Expression Scale. Results: A multiple regression model with TPRI reactivity as the dependent variable revealed a three-way interaction effect for anger management (i.e., AM = anger control minus anger out scores), ethnicity, and ET-1 polymorphism. Specifically, AA carriers of the ET-1 polymorphism with poor AM skills exhibited the greatest TPRI reactivity. Conclusions: Individuals with a genetic predisposition for exaggerated vasoconstriction who also display low AM skills may be at particular risk for development of stress-induced EH. Such individuals may particularly benefit from anger management training. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Parents were interviewed about the media habits of their 6-month to 6-year-old children. For children who had used computers, linear increases in computer usage occurred across this age range with a shift from using a computer on a parent's lap at about age 2 1/2 to autonomous computer and mouse use at about age 3 1/2. There were almost no gender differences in early computer patterns. Families with higher incomes and higher education levels were more likely to own computers and to have Internet access from home. Latino families were least likely to own a computer; Latino and African American families were less likely than Caucasian families to have Internet access at home. Parents perceived computers favorably for children's learning. No relationship was found between the frequency with which children play computer games and the likelihood that they can read, but increased nongame computer use was associated with increased likelihood of reading.

AB  - There is a small but growing body of research supporting the effectiveness of computer-generated environments in exposure therapy for driving phobia. However, research also suggests that difficulties can readily arise whereby patients do not immerse in simulated driving scenes. The simulated driving environments are not 'real enough' to undertake exposure therapy. This sets a limitation to the use of virtual reality (VR) exposure therapy as a treatment modality for driving phobia. The aim of this study was to investigate if a clinically acceptable immersion/presence rate of >80% could be achieved for driving phobia subjects in computer generated environments by modifying external factors in the driving environment. Eleven patients referred from the Accident and Emergency Department of a general hospital or from their General Practitioner following a motor vehicle accident, who met DSM-IV criteria for Specific Phobia-driving were exposed to a computer-generated driving environment using computer driving games (London Racer/Midtown Madness). In an attempt to make the driving environments 'real enough,' external factors were modified by (a) projection of images onto a large screen, (b) viewing the scene through a windscreen, (c) using car seats for both driver and passenger, and (d) increasing vibration sense through use of more powerful subwoofers. Patients undertook a trial session involving driving through computer environments with graded risk of an accident. 'Immersion/presence' was operationally defined as a subjective rating by the subject that the environment 'feels real,' together with an increase in subjective units of distress (SUD) ratings of >3 and/or an increase of heart rate of >15 beats per minute (BPM). Ten of 11 (91%) of the driving phobic subjects met the criteria for immersion/ presence in the driving environment enabling progression to VR exposure therapy. These provisional findings suggest that the paradigm adopted in this study might be an effective and relatively inexpensive means of developing driving environments 'real enough/to make VR exposure therapy a viable treatment modality for driving phobia following a motor vehicle accident (MVA).

AB  - Based on the greater incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) among males than among females, the investigation tested the hypothesis that in young adults (aged 17–29 yrs), males would show more cardiovascular reactivity than females to 2 stressors, a video game and cigarette smoking. Ss were 47 male and 61 female college students. Five of the 6 comparisons did not support the hypothesis: females were higher on heart rate and diastolic blood pressure reactivity to both stressors; males were higher on systolic blood pressure reactivity to the video game only. Results suggest that females may be particularly physiologically reactive to cigarette smoking. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Examined the role of gender in hemodynamic response patterns to stress. 64 male and 55 female undergraduates were administered a protocol of rest, mental arithmetic, video game, and anger recall interview while blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac impedance measures were obtained. Men had higher levels of systolic blood pressure and cardiac output and greater reactivity to tasks. Extreme groups of myocardial and vascular reactors were formed from cardiac output and total peripheral resistance change scores during mental arithmetic. The myocardial reactors exhibited greater sensitivity to task demands, whereas vascular reactors exhibited comparable total peripheral resistance increases to all tasks. Vascular reactors exhibited greater diastolic blood pressure reactivity than myocardial reactors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Throughout his revolutionary scholarly career, Leonard B. Meyer argued that music is a subjective, cognitive experience. Musical structure to Meyer was not an abstract and timeless object frozen on the notated page, but rather a very real, dynamic process in the listener's mind. Thus, what was once the domain solely of musicologists became fair game for psychologists. Conversely, Meyer made subjects such as emotion, expectation, and memory reasonable ones for musicologists, allowing them to shift attention from composers' processes to listeners' perceptions, and to demand more rigor and evidence for claims about the nature of musical structure. At the same time, he showed those in the sciences and in the humanities the value of crossing disciplinary boundaries. By using the methods of cognitive psychology, anthropology, linguistics, computer science, and other fields, one gains invaluable knowledge about musical experience. Even more important, by studying music, one learns about the totality of human experience: the arts, language, culture, and history. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study investigates how game playing experience changes when a story is added to a first-person shooter game. Dependent variables include identification, presence, emotional experiences and motivations. When story was present, game players felt greater identification, sense of presence, and physiological arousal. The presence of story did not affect self-reported arousal or dominance. This study clearly demonstrates that story is something that video game players enjoy; it helps involve them in the game play, makes them feel more immersed in the virtual environment, and keeps them aroused. The greater character identification may be especially worrisome, as past research has shown that justified media violence disinhibits actual aggression on the part of the audience.

AB  - Examined the longitudinal association between BP reactivity to a video game and resting BP 3–4 yrs later in 83 Samoan adolescents from American and Western Samoa as part of a multidisciplinary study of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in modern Samoans. Ss ranged in age from 11–14 yrs at baseline (in 1992–1993), and 14–18 yrs at follow-up in 1996. The predictive effect of baseline video game BP reactivity on follow-up resting BP was tested using regression models with baseline resting BP, baseline body mass index, and age as covariates. Systolic BP reactivity to the video game at baseline was significantly and independently associated with resting systolic BP 3–4 yrs later. Ss who had higher systolic BP reactivity scores at baseline had significantly higher resting systolic BP at follow-up. There were no interactions between sex and reactivity or between residence (American or Western Samoa) and reactivity in the models. The authors conclude that video game cardiovascular reactivity seems to assess aspects of psychophysiological arousal and prospective CVD risk in Samoan adolescents of both sexes, and may be useful for understanding the role of psychosocial stress and health in modernizing societies.

AB  - The aim of the experimental study described in this article is to investigate the effect of a lifelike character with subtle expressivity on the affective state of users. The character acts as a quizmaster in the context of a mathematical game. This application was chosen as a simple, and for the sake of the experiment, highly controllable, instance of human-computer interfaces and software. Subtle expressivity refers to the character's affective response to the user's performance by emulating multimodal human-human communicative behavior such as different body gestures and varying linguistic style. The impact of em-pathic behavior, which is a special form of affective response, is examined by deliberately frustrating the user during the game progress. There are two novel aspects in this investigation. First, we employ an animated interface agent to address the affective state of users rather than a text-based interface, which has been used in related research. Second, while previous empirical studies rely on questionnaires to evaluate the effect of life-like characters, we utilize physiological information of users (in addition to questionnaire data) in order to precisely associate the occurrence of interface events with users' autonomic nervous system activity. The results of our study indicate that empathic character response can significantly decrease user stress and that affective behavior may have a positive effect on users' perception of the difficulty of a task.

AB  - Assessed the effects of environmental stimuli that differentially influence subjective and autonomic arousal on dishabituation of salivation. 30 female undergraduates were preloaded on a lemon yogurt milkshake and habituated to 7 presentations of lemon juice. Prior to the 8th presentation of juice, Ss were presented an engaging video game designed to produce subjective but no autonomic arousal (LO), a video game plus mental arithmetic stressor designed to produce both subjective and physiological arousal (HI), or no stimuli (REST) control. Significant dishabituating effects of HI vs REST were shown for salivation. Heart rate was significantly higher during the dishabituator for HI than for LO or REST conditions, which were equal. Finally, significant differences in arousal were shown between each of the 3 conditions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Replicated a study by J. R. Turner and D. Carroll (see record [rid]1986-13875-001[/rid]). Heart rate, oxygen consumption, and respiratory activity were recorded for 18 male undergraduates performing mental arithmetic task and playing a video game. Measurements were also taken while Ss undertook a graded static leg lifting exercise. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed physiological activity increasing as an orderly function of exercise workload. Overall predicted heart rate values were significantly less than the values recorded during the tasks. Whereas mental arithmetic was associated with an increase over expected heart rates of the same order as those observed in the earlier study using graded dynamic exercise, the video game elicited decidedly less 'additional' heart rate in the present case.

AB  - Human-computer interaction (HCI), as a field, has made great strides toward understanding and improving our interactions with computer-based technologies. From the early explorations of direct interaction with computers, we have reached the point where usability, usefulness, and an appreciation of technology's social impact, including its risks, are widely accepted goals in computing. HCI researchers, designers, and usability engineers work in a variety of settings on many kinds of technologies. Topics include not only the office systems where HCI work began, but also tiny mobile devices, Web and Internet services, games, and large networked systems. This special issue introduces a rapidly emerging technology and new focus for HCI-autonomous robots and the human-robot interactions required by these robots. HCI, and its sister discipline, human factors, offers a rich resource for research and design in human-robot interaction. Much has been learned in the last 3 decades about how people perceive and think about computer-based technologies, about human constraints on interaction with machines, about the factors that improve usability, and about the primary and secondary effects of technology on people and organizations. Much of this work will be applicable to robots. Nonetheless, autonomous robots are a distinctive case for several reasons. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Recent acts of extreme violence involving teens and associated links to violent video games have led to an increased interest in video game violence. Research suggests that violent video games influence aggressive behavior, aggressive affect, aggressive cognition, and physiological arousal. C. A. Anderson and B. J. Bushman [Annu. Rev. Psychol. 53 (2002) 27.] have posited a General Aggression Model (GAM) to explain the mechanism behind the link between violent video games and aggressive behavior. However, the influence of violent video games as a function of developmental changes across adolescence has yet to be addressed. The purpose of this review is to integrate the GAM with developmental changes that occur across adolescence. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Compared the effects of measuring resting blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) immediately before or after a reactivity assessment in 451 8th-graders. The reactivity task was a 3-game sequence of a television video game. The order of resting and reactivity measurements was randomized by examination day (a total of 19 days). Results show an absence of significant order effects on BP and HR reactivity. This indicates that measurement order is not always a necessary consideration in studies of reactivity.

AB  - Evaluated hemodynamic responses to 3 standard laboratory stressors (i.e., postural change, video game, forehead cold) in 341 children (mean age 11.2 yrs). Evidence of consistency in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output, and total peripheral resistance responses to all 3 stressors was observed. The highest and most consistent correlations across stressors were observed for cardiac output and total peripheral resistance responses. The need for clarification in the categorization of lab stressors used to measure reactivity is discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Monitored heart rate (HR) and various metabolic and ventilatory indices in 20 male Ss (aged 18–30 yrs) during a video game, a stressful mental arithmetic task, and graded isotonic exercise. Data show that all measures changed as a function of psychological challenge and that during exercise physiological activity increased as an orderly function of workload. HR was then plotted against oxygen consumption over the various exercise loads. It was found that, for most Ss, the analogous data points for the video game and mental arithmetic lay reliably above the exercise HR/oxygen consumption regression lines. When these regression lines were used to predict HR values during psychological challenge, the predicted values were significantly less than the values actually recorded for both tasks; although the discrepancy between predicted and actual values was on average greater with mental arithmetic, the difference was not statistically reliable. Prestressor baseline conditions were also associated with HR levels greater than predicted, but to a lesser extent. (22 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The paper explores the temporal nature of an evolving leisure experience. A model is proposed that investigates the antecedents and consequences of attribution- dependent emotions in the performance context of a live sporting event. Attribution-dependent emotions are those arising in response to the praiseworthy and blameworthy actions of the performers charged with delivering a performance. Antecedents of attribution-dependent affect include goal relevance and affective expectations. Consequences of attribution-dependent affect include spectators' satisfaction with the quality of the performance and their perceptions of its entertainment value. Performance satisfaction and goal relevance predict optimism about the team's chances in future games. The model is applied to data collected from 228 student participants watching conference basketball games involving their school's men's team on television, who reported their affective expectations and emotions during the game.

AB  - The formation of attitudes toward novel objects was examined as a function of exploratory behavior. An initial experiment, in which participants played a computer game that required them to learn which stimuli, when sampled, produced favorable or unfavorable outcomes, demonstrated learning, attitude formation, and generalization to novel objects. The findings also revealed 2 interesting valence asymmetries: a learning asymmetry involving better learning for negatively valenced than positively valenced objects and a generalization asymmetry involving stronger generalization as a function of negative than of positive attitudes. Findings from 4 experiments led to an explanation of the learning asymmetry in terms of information gain being contingent on approach behavior and related the generalization asymmetry to a negativity bias that weighs resemblance to a known negative more heavily than resemblance to a positive.

AB  - This study sought to investigate if virtual reality technology enhances the psychological benefits of aerobic exercise in a laboratory setting. In this study, 88 university faculty and staff (44 females, 44 males) were randomly assigned to one of three 30-min conditions including: (1) bicycling at a moderate intensity (60-70% maximum heart rate) on a stationary bicycle, (2) playing a virtual reality computer bicycle game, or (3) an interactive virtual reality bicycle experience on a computer while exercising on a stationary bike at moderate intensity (60-70% maximum heart rate). The Activation-Deactivation Adjective Check List (AD-ACL) was administered immediately before and after the laboratory session. Results suggest that virtual reality enhances some of the mood benefits when paired with exercise. Virtual reality when paired with exercise enhances enjoyment, energy, and reduces tiredness. Virtual reality without exercise was discovered to increase participants' tension, tiredness, and lower their energy level. Results suggest that the combination of virtual reality and exercise might improve some of the beneficial psychological effects of exercise compared with virtual reality or exercise alone.

AB  - The institutional context for gerontechnology development in France is improving. Still a number of obstacles remain before rapid mainstreaming of products and services in mass markets can take place. Some service providers are working on Telehealth service platforms with a 24/24 medical service. Many innovative products and services are proposed to local authorities who support autonomy and care for the home dwelling frail or disabled elderly persons: wearable geo-localizers, transmission of vital signs, emergency situations detecting devices for support, video interactive communication connected to touch-screen computers or TV-video games are used successfully in nursing homes for entertainment and cognitive stimulation. A catalogue assessing the use, reliability and availability of the gerontechnological devices is required. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Virtual reality can be used to provide phobic clients with therapeutic exposure to phobogenic stimuli. However, purpose-built therapeutic VR hardware and software can be expensive and difficult to adapt to individual client needs. In this study, inexpensive and readily adaptable PC computer games were used to provide exposure therapy to 13 phobic participants and 13 non-phobic control participants. It was found that anxiety could be induced in phobic participants by exposing them to phobogenic stimuli in therapeutic virtual environments derived from computer games (TVEDG). Assessments were made of the impact of simulator sickness and of sense of presence on the phobogenic effectiveness of TVEDGs. Participants reported low levels of simulator sickness, and the results indicate that simulator sickness had no significant impact on either anxiety or sense of presence. Group differences, correlations, and regression analyses indicate a synergistic relationship between presence and anxiety. These results do not support Slater's¹ contention that presence and emotion are orthogonal. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - We describe the design and implementation of SenToy, a tangible doll with sensors that allows a user to influence the emotions of a synthetic character in a game. SenToy is an input device that allows the user to perform gestures or movements that the sensors inside the doll pick up. The gestures are interpreted according to a scheme found through two different user studies: one Wizard of Oz study and one study with a fully functioning SenToy. Different gestures express one of the following emotions: anger, fear, surprise, sadness, gloating and happiness. Depending upon the expressed emotion, the synthetic character in the game will, in turn, perform different actions (trading, duelling, etc.). The evaluation of SenToy acting as the interface to the computer game FantasyA has shown that the users were able to express the desired emotions to influence the synthetic characters, and that overall players liked the doll as an interface.

AB  - The 3 most common leisure time activities reported by 2,200 3rd and 4th grade children (aged 7–12 yrs) and the association of the intensity levels of those activities with demographic variables and risk factors for cardiovascular disease are presented. Activities reported most often by boys were playing video games (33%), playing football (32%), bicycling (31%), watching television (28%), and playing basketball (26%). The girls reported doing homework (39%), bicycling (31%), watching television (30%), dancing (27%), and reading (23%). The average metabolic equivalent was 4.2 for girls and 4.8 for boys. Among boys, African Americans reported more vigorous activities whereas White girls reported somewhat more vigorous activities than those reported by non-White girls. A higher socioeconomic status, was associated with a greater proportion of sedentary activities. The risk factors of cholesterol, blood pressure, skinfold thickness, and body mass index were not significantly associated with total activity score. However, significantly more nonobese than obese children reported a vigorous (high-intensity) activity as one of their top 3 activities. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Examines self-reported hostility and cardiac reactivity of Type A and Type B Ss. Forty male students (median age 22.4 yrs) from 4 groups (Type A, high hostility; Type A, low hostility; Type B, high hostility; Type B, low hostility) underwent 3 tests: mental arithmetic, competitive video game and cardiac defense response to high intense auditory stimulation. Results showed no differences in heart rate reactivity between Type A and Type B Ss with high self-reported hostility but differences between Type A and Type B Ss with low hostility. Type A Ss increased heart rate during habituation of the cardiac defense response and competitive video game. Denial or suppression of hostility in Type A Ss may be associated with increased cardiovascular reactivity. (Spanish abstract) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Examined whether elevated cardiovascular response to stressful stimuli for individuals who are defensive in their reporting of anger might be moderated by the demands of the stressor task. 40 male undergraduates were exposed to 4 tasks: shock avoidance video game, handgrip, film, and cold pressor. Defensive/low anger Ss exhibited elevated heart rate and systolic blood pressure responses as compared with other Ss, but only to the shock avoidance task. Defensive/low anger Ss also reported less state anger to all tasks. It is proposed that an anger defensive style results in elevated cardiovascular activity only in interaction with stressors that elicit a sympathetic nervous system response and/or involve evaluation threat.

AB  - The ultimatum game describes a social bargaining situation in which considerations of fairness become relevant. At first sight, experimental research seems to contradict game theoretical predictions: The majority of proposals are aimed at equal division, and responders are willing to refuse offers that are perceived as too low. In order to explain fair behavior (and morality in general), non-material incentives are also important. In this article, a new evolutionary model of fairness is presented that explains the rejection of positive offers. I follow Frank's (1992) approach, in which emotions, if perceived, are recognized as rendering the threat of sanctions creditable. Furthermore, the idea of inspection costs is combined with the noise level suggested by Binmore and Samuelson (1994). Computer simulations demonstrate the evolution of norms of fairness: It is beneficial for responders to refuse low offers because this raises the share offered. As a result, this model explains orientations toward fairness as an outcome of evolutionary forces which themselves are due to individual self-interest.

AB  - Examined whether gender differences in health behavior can be explained by gender differences in avoidant emotion regulation. For 248 primary school students avoidant emotion regulation, health behavior, and Body Mass Index were assessed. Children's self report data were validated with their mother's ratings. Additionally, the number of days the children missed school because of illness was assessed (mother's perspective). The results indicate that girls take better care of their oral hygiene, act more carefully in traffic situations, eat healthier food, and are less interested in sports as well as in watching TV and in playing computer games. Furthermore, they sleep longer and avoid dangerous games. While gender differences in physical exercise and in playing dangerous games are due to boys' higher scores in avoidant regulation, boys who score low in avoidant regulation play computer games more frequently. These non defensive boys were highest in relative body weight but missed school less often. Considering the results, the costs and benefits of avoidant emotion regulation for health behavior are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Tested the hypothesis that aggressive boys' tendency to attribute hostile intentions to peers is exacerbated in a negative emotional state. 29 highly aggressive boys in special education for aggressive behavior problems, 12 moderately aggressive boys in regular education, and 16 nonaggressive boys in regular education (all subjects aged 9-13 yrs) inferred peers' intentions in 8 vignettes concerning ambiguous provocation by peers. Mild negative emotions were induced by unjust loss of a manipulated computer game. Half the vignettes were completed in this negative emotional state. After completion of all vignettes, the game was played again and won to reinduce positive feelings. Self-ratings of feelings obtained throughout the study show that the manipulations consecutively induced negative and positive feelings. Negative feelings increased hostile attribution of intent in the highly aggressive group. Highly and moderately aggressive boys responded more aggressively than nonaggressive boys.

AB  - The present study was designed to compare respiratory changes during the detection of guilty knowledge test in a mock crime situation with respiratory changes during laboratory stressors. Sixteen male and fourteen female undergraduates participated in the following five sessions: pre-trial rest (PR), mental arithmetic (MA), a video game(VG), detection of deception (DD), and post-trial rest (PO). Of the respiratory control indices, respiratory drive (mean inspiratory flow rate) significantly increased during MA and VG, whereas respiratory timing (inspiratory time / breath time) did not show any consistent changes during either stressors. In contrast, the index of respiratory drive did not show any significant increments in response to critical items in the guilty knowledge test in the DD condition, in which each subjects were required to commit a mock theft. Decrements in expiratory volume and minute ventilation in response to critical items were significantly greater than those in response to non-critical items. These results suggested that respiration during stress tends to be hyperventilated, and also suggested that respiration during deception is characterized by inhibitory breathing.

AB  - An excessive blood pressure (BP) response to mental stress is a widely reported characteristic of young normotensive offspring of hypertensive parents. At odds with these reports are data from a large biracial study (C. K. Ewart et al; see record [rid]1988-04840-001[/rid]) showing that high risk adolescent offspring had diminished pulse pressure under mental stress and no evidence of greater BP reactivity. This apparent contradiction was examined in a similar but larger sample of 186 Black and 86 White normotensive adolescents (aged 14–15 yrs) comparing BP and heart rate responses to video game, mirror drawing, mental arithmetic, interview, and physical exercise in high- and low-risk offspring. Results replicated the diminished pulse pressure finding, suggesting that it is characteristic of African Americans and is evoked by behavioral tasks that entail skeletal-motor inhibition.

AB  - Notes that the inverse relation between socioeconomic status (SES) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk has been posited to be partially due to exaggerated cardiovascular reactivity (CVR) to stress. Stress elicits hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation (e.g., increased cortisol secretion), which may contribute to subsequent blood pressure (BP) elevation. The present study assessed univariate associations among SES, cortisol secretion, and aggregated change scores to stressors (i.e., video game and forehead cold) for systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) in a sample of 24 African American males (aged 16-25 yrs). Circadian variability of cortisol level was taken into account by partialling out collection time. Family SES was inversely related to initial cortisol level. Neighborhood SES was inversely related to DBP reactivity. The change in cortisol level during the stressor protocol was related to SBP reactivity. These results suggest that SES may be linked to CVD via BP and cortisol reactivity to stress, but prospective studies are needed to clarify whether such is the case.

AB  - Examined the effects of mild psychological stress on selective attention, as assessed by the negative priming (NP) paradigm. Salivary measures of the stress hormone cortisol (CORT) and α-amylase (a correlate of norepinephrine [NE]) were assayed to probe the relationship between the stress response and attentional inhibition. 20 healthy Ss (aged 18–24 yrs) engaged in the attention task, which was then followed by 15 min of a stressful video game before a return to the attentional task. Baseline saliva samples were obtained before the experiment began, 1 min after the video-game stressor, and 20 min post-stress. Ss showed a significant reduction in NP and a decrease in reaction time (RT) after the video game. Moreover, α-amylase levels increased significantly after the stressor, indicating the role of NE in the acute stress response. While CORT levels remained unchanged after stress, CORT correlated significantly with both NP scores and RT after the stressor. These results imply that mild psychological stress can significantly alter attentional processes. Given the increase in α-amylase and the correlation between attention and CORT after stress, it seems likely that attentional processes are under tight control by brain systems which mediate the fight-or-flight response.

AB  - Every cultural community provides developmental pathways for children within some ecological-cultural (ecocultural) context. Cultural pathways are made up of everyday routines of life, and routines are made up of cultural activities children engage. Activities (bedtime, playing video games, homework, watching TV, cooking dinner, soccer practice, visiting grandma, babysitting for money, algebra class) are useful units for cultural analysis because they are meaningful units for parents and children, and they are amenable to ethnographic fieldwork, systemic observation, and interviewing. Activities crystallize culture directly in everyday experience, because they include values and goals, resources needed to make the activity happen, people in relationships, the tasks the activity is there to accomplish, emotions and motives of those engaged in the activity, and a script defining the appropriate, normative way to engage in that activity. The Ecocultural Family Interview provides a window into children's and families' daily routines and activities. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Used a general model of affective aggression to generate predictions concerning hot temperatures (HTs). Exp 1 examined HT effects on hostile affect, hostile cognition, perceived arousal, and physiological arousal with 107 undergraduates who played video games while room temperature was controlled. Exp 2 examined HT effects on hostile affect, perceived and physiological arousal, and general positive and negative affect with 43 undergraduates who performed brief aerobic exercise. HTs increased hostile affect, hostile cognition, and physiological arousal, and decreased perceived arousal and general positive affect. Results suggest that HTs may increase aggressive tendencies by 3 separate routes. Hostile affect, hostile cognitions, and excitation transfer processes may increase the likelihood of biased appraisals of ambiguous social events, biased in a hostile direction. The usefulness of the general model was supported. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Examined racial differences in cardiovascular (CV) reactivity in 128 healthy Black and White siblings (average age 13 yrs). Ss included 15 pairs of Black siblings and their age- and sex-matched unrelated controls and 17 pairs of White siblings and their age- and sex-matched unrelated controls. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and heart rate (HR) measurements were obtained at rest and during a stress task (competitive video game). Black Ss demonstrated a significantly higher intraclass correlation for DBP reactivity than Black controls or White Ss. Black Ss demonstrated a steeper rise and then a plateau in DBP and HR reactivity to the video game task, while White Ss showed a more gradual increase in these measures over the course of playing 3 video games. Results suggest a stronger genetic influence of CV reactivity in Black than in White children. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Examined the relationship between endogenous estradiol and progesterone levels and cardiovascular activity at rest and during stress in 44 female undergraduates. Ss were tested in both the follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle. During the luteal phase, higher levels of estradiol were associated with lower levels of cardiac output responses to the combined video game and speech tasks, and lower levels of heart rate and systolic BP responses to the cold pressor. Also, higher levels of progesterone were associated with higher total peripheral resistance and lower stroke volume responses to the cold pressor. During the follicular phase, higher levels of progesterone were associated with lower vascular resistance responses to the cold pressor. Results suggest that estradiol may contribute to a lowering of cardiovascular responses to stress. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Explored the construct validity of learning style as operationalised in the Learning Styles Inventory (LSI) and its relationship with cognitive style as measured using the Cognitive Styles Analysis (CSA). In addition, the relationship between styles and learning preferences were examined. Ss were 107 male and female university students (aged 19–55 yrs) who completed the LSI and CSA. Ss also completed learning preferences measures which consisted of a list of teaching and learning methods to which Ss had been exposed during the normal course of their studies. The 3 groups of methods that were distinguished included autonomous methods (open/distance/flexible learning and computer-assisted learning), collaborative methods (role play, group work, and games and simulations), and dependent methods (tutorial/surgery and lecture). The results suggest that the LSI assesses 2 dimensions (comprehension and transformation). Further, learning style and cognitive style appear to be independent. The relationship between style and preference is mediated by gender. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Cardiovascular responsivity to and recovery from acute laboratory stressors, as derived from aggregate scores of cardiovascular functioning during and after postural change, video game challenge, social competence interview, and parent–child conflict discussion, were evaluated in 272 Black and White youths (mean age 13.5 yrs) with a positive family history of essential hypertension. Results show that Blacks demonstrated greater systolic and diastolic BP and lower heart rate responsivity vs Whites. A race by neighborhood SES interaction for systolic BP responsivity was also observed where low SES Whites and high SES Blacks had the greatest responsivity vs their same race cohorts. Upper SES Whites had the lowest total peripheral resistance responsivity. For recovery, Blacks and males exhibited higher systolic BP during recovery vs Whites and females, respectively. These findings extend previous studies and provide further support for the hypothesis that recovery from stress is a potentially informative component of the contribution of stress responsivity to cardiovascular disease.

AB  - Affective and cognitive responses to a product trial are examined in an experiment containing 2 cells representing 2 product types: hedonic and functional. The stimulus products were a computer game and grammar-checking software. Ss were 42 college students. The specific affective responses studied were pleasure and arousal, and brand cognitions are represented as the expectancy value from brand attributes. The relative level and influence of affective and cognitive responses to a product trial were shown to differ significantly, depending on whether the product was hedonic or functional in nature. Specifically, for the hedonic product, felt arousal during the trial was higher than for the functional product, and emotional responses were significant antecedents of Ss' evaluations of the trial experience. Brand cognitions, however, were not significantly related to trial evaluations for the hedonic product. In contrast, for the functional product, brand cognitions and pleasure were significant antecedents of trial evaluations, but arousal was not. Findings of this study demonstrate the importance of considering both the cognitive structure created by a product trial and the consumer's emotional reactions to the trial.

AB  - To evaluate the possible negative association between risk for hypertension and pain sensitivity in women, 24 healthy young adult women with a parental history of hypertension and 24 without a parental history of hypertension participated in 2 laboratory sessions in which electric shock and the cold-pressor test were administered. To assess the possible role of stress-induced analgesia in blood pressure-related hypoalgesia, the sessions were identical with the exception of the fact that participants were exposed to a stressful 20-min video game before the pain stimuli on one occasion and a nonstressful control task on the other. Women with a parental history of hypertension and high blood pressure reactivity to the video game displayed a reduced sensitivity to electric shock on both days, suggesting that risk for hypertension is associated with reduced sensitivity to at least some pain stimuli in women. Blood pressure reactivity to stress-associated baroreceptor stimulation was not implicated as a mediator of decreased pain perception. However, other analyses revealed an effect of family history on shock pain only among women who reported relatively high anxiety, suggesting that other aspects of the stress response may be involved in this phenomenon.

AB  - Reviewed the English-language literature in MEDLINE and PsycINFO from 1966 to 1996 regarding the effects of playing video games on the well-being of children. Results show that playing video games is associated with a variety of physical effects including increased metabolic and heart rate, seizures, and tendinitis. Aggressive behavior may result from playing video games, especially among younger children. There is no direct relationship between psychopathology or academic performance and playing video games. Overall findings indicate that although video games have some adverse effects, they are also valuable learning tools. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Past estimates of the magnitude of Type A-B differences in cardiovascular reactivity are probably overly conservative. In addition, it is unclear which situations are more likely to elicit excessive reactivity in Type As. The present meta-analysis found that, overall, Type As had greater heart rate (mean d = .22), diastolic blood pressure (d = .22), and especially systolic blood pressure responses (d = .33) than Type Bs; these effect sizes were small but relatively consistent. However, Type As showed especially greater cardiovascular reactivity in situations characterized as having (1) positive or negative feedback evaluation, (2) socially aversive elements such as verbal harassment or criticism, and (3) elements inherent in playing video games. Measures of time urgency, Type A assessment method, and gender were not found to be strongly related to A-B differences in cardiovascular reactivity. Future studies that use more 'Type A-relevant' situations will probably find greater effects. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Attempted to manipulate an athlete's facilitative or debilitative appraisal of competitive anxiety through imagery-based interventions in order to study the effects on subsequent anxiety intensity and direction. In a within-Ss design, 24 experienced soccer players were relaxed via progressive relaxation audiotape and then randomly underwent an imagery-based video and audiotaped manipulation of their appraisal of taking a hypothetical game winning penalty kick under either a 'pressure' or 'challenge' appraisal emphasis. There was no significant effect for heart rate. For both intensity and direction scores the challenge condition produced less cognitive anxiety, less somatic anxiety, and more self-confidence than the pressure situation. This finding suggests that a challenge appraisal manipulation taught by applied sport psychologists might benefit athletes' performance. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Blood pressure and heart rate were measured at rest and during a TV video game in 399 healthy 3rd grade children and at 2-yr follow-up. Ss were classified according to race (60 Black, 337 White), gender (201 girls), body mass index (light/heavy), and video game performance (low score/high score). Irrespective of classification variable, absolute reactivity values (e.g., a heart rate of 110 bpm) tended to be more stable than change reactivity values (e.g., a heart rate change of 10 bpm). The greater stability of absolute values was most pronounced with systolic blood pressure. Absolute values were at least as stable as resting values and frequently demonstrated greater stability. Mean and maximal reactivities were correlated comparably. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Notes that new approaches to artificial intelligence, particularly those using autonomous software agents encapsulated in software robots (softbots), have the potential to make an enormous impact on game-based artificial intelligence systems. Softbot-based autonomous software agents provide a framework capable of supporting psychologically based models of human behavior in a game environment. Used in this manner, softbots provide a new set of tools to explore the synthesis of human-like reasoning in complex and dynamic environments. This article explores some initial attempts to develop an exploratory, game-based, experimental environment capable of hosting softbot-based, psychological models of human behavior. Preliminary work in the design and implementation of a simple, extensible, softbot-based, computer-modeled opponent is also discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Reports an error in The effect of video game violence on physiological desensitization to real-life violence by Nicholas L. Carnagey, Craig A. Anderson and Brad J. Bushman (Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 2007[May], Vol 43[3], 489-496). The publisher regrets that some of the authors' corrections were not incorporated. The legend to Fig. 2 should read: 'Heart rate at baseline, after playing a video game, and while watching filmed real-life violence for violent and nonviolent video game players. Mean heart rates for violent and nonviolent video game players during the viewing of filmed real-life violence were 70.7 and 68.5, respectively. All means are adjusted for gender. Capped vertical bars denote 1 SE.' Some of the means in Fig. 3 do not correspond to the means in the text, and the legend is missing some information. Fig. 3 should be replaced with the figure and legend given in the erratum. On page 494, in the first paragraph, two F-tests are misreported. The fourth to the last sentence should be replaced with: 'Furthermore, nonviolent game participants had a slight (nonsignificant) increase in GSR change while viewing the film, F(1,127)=.52, p>.05, d=.13, whereas violent game participants showed a decrease in GSR, F(1,113)=7.19, p<.05, d=.50.' (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2007-05686-020[/rid].) Past research shows that violent video game exposure increases aggressive thoughts, angry feelings, physiological arousal, aggressive behaviors, and decreases helpful behaviors. However, no research has experimentally examined violent video game effects on physiological desensitization, defined as showing less physiological arousal to violence in the real world after exposure to video game violence in the virtual world. This experiment attempts to fill this gap. Participants reported their media habits and then played one of eight violent or nonviolent video games for 20min. Next, participants watched a 10-min videotape containing scenes of real-life violence while heart rate (HR) and galvanic skin response (GSR) were monitored. Participants who previously played a violent video game had lower HR and GSR while viewing filmed real violence, demonstrating a physiological desensitization to violence. Results are interpreted using an expanded version of the General Aggression Model. Links between desensitization, antisocial, and prosocial behavior are discussed.

AB  - Tested the association between (1) components of the Type A behavior pattern measured by structured interview (SI) and (2) sympatho-adrenal activation indexed by urinary catecholamines, pituitary-adrenal responsiveness measured by salivary cortisol, cardiovascular activation measured by heart rate and pulse transit time, and renal sodium excretion. 16 university students completed the Jenkins Activity Survey and a laboratory session that included the performance of a video game. The highest levels of significance for univariate F-tests were obtained from cardiovascular reactivity and recovery measures and for dopamine and adrenaline measures when groups were formed by a median criterion to global Type A assessed by the SI: Hostility plus Time Urgency. High and low Dysphoria groups were identified by a model incorporating catecholamines, cardiovascular, and cortisol recovery measures. Results suggest a psychoendocrine influence on the adrenal cortex. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Tested whether increased self-efficacy in active coping would increase cardiovascular response when effort is left unconstrained. 40 female college students (aged 18–21 yrs) were randomly assigned to low or high self-efficacy conditions. They completed 50 questions which helped the experimenter to manipulate self-efficacy by giving them false feedback that conformed to the efficacy condition they were assigned to. Ss then engaged in a video game shape-matching task, while their BP and heart rate were monitored. Results reveal that Ss in the high self-efficacy condition group had greater increases in BP than the Ss in the low self-efficacy group. No differences were observed in heart rate. It is concluded that self-efficacy for a task may be an integral part of the active coping process, indirectly affecting the BP response. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - For his research on computer games as vehicles of instruction, the author developed a workstation that Ss may use to self-collect and record data while interacting with software. The advantage of this type of data-gathering/observational device is that it preserves and support a S's sense of autonomy and control in the experimental environment. This article discusses the rationale and general requirements for such an apparatus, as well as some limitations of building and using this type of research tool.

AB  - Examined the impact of context on advertising effectiveness. 86 university students viewed a televised soccer game where the timing of commercials varied according to 2 experimental conditions. Half of the Ss viewed the game without commercial interruptions (commercials were shown at half time and before the post-game show), and the other 43 Ss were assigned to an intrusive condition where the commercials interrupted the game. Results show an inverted-U relationship between involvement with the television program and ad memory and attitude toward the ad. An increase in involvement from low to moderate levels of program involvement resulted in higher advertising effectiveness. However, further increases in program involvement beyond moderate to high levels lead to decreases in ad memory and attitude toward the ad. Results are interpreted in terms of arousal theory, and implications for the slotting and design of commercials are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Examined the generalizability of the spacing effect to an alternating task module (ATM) protocol for 3 complex tasks, each requiring multiple hours of practice. 43 18–30 yr olds were exposed to either the ATM protocol, which alternated sessions on algebra word problems and video-game-like tasks of Space Fortress and Phoenix, or a massed protocol which blocked sessions on the task. Spacing practice in the ATM protocol gave the Ss an advantage in learning and retention on Space Fortress and algebra word problems, and caused no decrement in performance on Phoenix. Arousal, not confidence or motivation, was implicated in the ATM advantage. Practical and theoretical implications of the relative speed of the ATM protocol are discussed.

AB  - Explored associations between components of Type A behavior and cardiovascular reactivity (CDR) during solitary and interpersonal competition. The influence of the opponent's gender was also examined. Type A behavior was assessed with the student version of the Jenkins Activity Survey in 135 male and 61 female undergraduates. Ss competed on a video game task against the machine or against men or women. CDR differed little between the genders and was generally higher during competition against a man than during competition against the machine, regardless of Type A component scores. CDR was greater in men who scored higher on the hard-driving/competitive component when the opponent was a woman. Findings are explained in terms of arousal associated with competitive engagement and attitudes about competition against men and women. Neither the speed/impatience scale nor the total Type A measure was consistently related to CDR. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Examined the effects of gender and emotional social support on cardiovascular reactivity in 46 Black adolescents (aged 13–16 yrs). Ss completed a familial social support scale and were assessed as to body mass and physical activity. Systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were measured at rest and during a competitive video game. Male Ss who reported receiving high levels of emotional support from family had significantly higher SBP and DBP reactivity than did female Ss who reported receiving high levels of emotional support. Male Ss who reported receiving high levels of emotional support showed higher SBP and DBP reactivity relative to male Ss who report having low levels of emotional support. Social and cultural factors may explain these differential findings across gender. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Examined the effect of sodium loading on the peripheral vascular responses to stress of offspring of hypertensives (HTs). 18 normotensive (NT) offspring of HTs and 18 NT offspring of NTs were exposed to a 1-hr shock-avoidance video-game procedure after 14 days of sodium loading and again after 14 days of placebo tablets. Order of sessions was counterbalanced between Ss in a double-blind design. In offspring of HTs, sodium loading elevated total peripheral resistance and norepinephrine responses to stress relative to placebo conditions and compared with offspring of NTs. These increases were accompanied by decreases in stroke volume and cardiac output. Sodium loading had no effect on offspring of NTs. Results suggest that the elevated resistance in offspring of HTs may suggest the initiation of pathological processes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - A video-game paradigm is introduced for the manipulation of appraisals in an ongoing active-coping task. Differences in current appraisal conceptions and their implications for experimental approaches to the manipulation of appraisals are discussed. Furthermore, the advantages of using concurrent physiological measures are outlined. The features of the game aMAZE and a shell program called PLAYGAME are described.

AB  - Assessed blood pressure (BP) responses of 64 Black and 56 White boys (aged 7–16 yrs) with family histories of essential hypertension. BP was assessed during 4 laboratory conditions: orthostatis, a video game, dynamic exercise, and a cold forehead condition. Ambulatory BP measures were obtained during the 24 hrs following each condition. Black Ss exhibited higher 24-hr ambulatory systolic and diastolic BP than did White Ss. Regardless of ethnicity, systolic BP responses during orthostatis, video game, and cold forehead conditions were significantly related to ambulatory systolic BP. Associations between diastolic BP responses and ambulatory measurements were somewhat dependent upon ethnicity and lab task. 13 Ss who were retested after 1 yr showed stable ambulatory BP measures over the 1-yr period. Results suggest that absolute systolic BP responses are generalizable across lab and field conditions, regardless of ethnicity. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Studied stereotypes of male and female target figures who could write computer programs, use a word processor, or play computer games. 42 male and 108 female undergraduates were asked to rate the described target figure on the 16 personality attributes previously used by G. Siann et al (see record [rid]1989-11698-001[/rid]). There was no evidence of negative stereotyping; few differences were found between the male and female target figures, and the pattern of ratings was similar for the 3 computer uses. Results indicate that irrespective of the sex of the target figure, stereotyping of the 3 uses differed according to the sex of the respondent. Females gave higher ratings on attributes reflecting autonomy and congeniality to the figures who could write a computer program, while males gave these figures the lowest ratings on the same attributes.

AB  - Determined whether social support operated as a moderator of cardiovascular reactivity in women. Two models of social support operation were examined: the direct-effects and buffering models. 26 women (aged 17–21 yrs) were exposed to 4 conditions while playing a video game: 2 levels of stress (low or high) and 2 levels of social support (alone or with a partner). BP and heart rate were monitored continuously. Ratings of stress were obtained for each condition. The support manipulation produced significant main effects for diastolic BP and stress ratings, with lower diastolic BP and ratings observed in the partnered condition. The interaction between support and stress produced lower reactivity for the cardiovascular measures in the high stress (but not the low stress) condition. Results support both the buffering and direct effects models. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Examined whether inconsistent findings for elevated cardiovascular response to stress in female offspring of hypertensives might be a function of lack of control for menstrual cycle phase, and stressor type employed. 30 healthy women (aged 18–35 yrs), half of whom were offspring of hypertensives, were tested in both the luteal and follicular phases of the menstrual cycle. In each session, Ss were exposed to 4 tasks: the cold pressor test, interpersonal speech, shock-avoidance video-game, and reading. The most consistent menstrual cycle effect was for offspring of normotensives who exhibited higher diastolic blood pressure and state-anger responses to the speech task in the follicular compared with the luteal phase. Though menstrual cycle had no consistent effect on offspring of hypertensives, their luteal phase diastolic blood pressure and state-anger responses to the speech task were elevated compared with controls.

In Exp 1 Ss participated in 2 trials of a high-involved mental task (video game) or a low-involved task (simple arithmetic). No odors were presented in Trial 1. Ss were presented with 1 of 3 natural scents (peppermint, lavender, or jasmine) in Trial 2. In Exp 2 ammonia as an example of a bad odor was presented to Ss in the same experimental design as in Exp 1. (English abstract) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Investigated relationships between laboratory task-related heart rate (HR) reactivity and HR responses in 2 daily life settings to demonstrate that the expression of HR reactivity during daily life depends on the nature of the daily life situation (DLS), or on subjective or behavioral responses in the DLS. 26 healthy, male medical students completed 1 laboratory session (consisting of pretask rest, reaction time (RT), video game, and mental arithmetic conditions) and 2 day-long field study periods, during which Ss either worked as student physicians in a medical clinic or attended classroom lectures. HR levels were significantly higher during clinic work periods, compared to classroom work periods and evenings of both days. HR responses to laboratory tasks correlated significantly with minimum, mean, and maximum HR responses from the clinic work period. Results replicate the findings of M. H.

AB  - Investigated the spontaneous generation of upward counterfactuals (CTFs) which improve reality, and downward CTFs which worsen reality, with 88 undergraduates playing a computer-simulated blackjack game. The outcome was framed to be perceived as either a win, a neutral, or a loss event. Loss frames produced more upward and fewer downward CTFs than win or neutral frames, but the overall prevalence of CTF thinking did not vary with outcome valence. Ss who expected to play the game again made more upward CTFs and were less satisfied with the outcome than Ss who did not expect to play again. However, once Ss saw the cards from which they could have selected had they 'hit' again (2 winning cards and 2 losing cards), all Ss generated primarily upward CTFs and showed a corresponding decrease in satisfaction. These results implicate cognitive and motivational factors in the generation of CTF thinking. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Compared effects of an active coping task (computerized stressors involving arithmetic, anagrams, and Atari games) and a passive coping task (cold pressor) on gastrointestinal transit time and glycemic response to an oral glucose load. 11 male undergraduates participated in 3 counterbalanced sessions, each including a 45-min baseline, 20-min experimental period, and 2.5-hr recovery period. The stressors produced different cardiovascular and catecholamine responses; systolic and diastolic blood pressure were highest during cold pressor, heart rate was highest during computer stressor, and norepinephrine excretion was greatest during cold pressor. However, both stressors delayed gastrointestinal transit time and both delayed the time of peak glucose response. Implications of these findings for patients with diabetes and for effects of stress on eating behavior are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Examined relations among aerobic fitness (AF), psychological characteristics, and cardiovascular reactivity, using 62 men (mean age 42 yrs) divided into highly fit and less fit groups based on a treadmill exercise test. Several psychological and physiological variables were measured, and Ss' cardiovascular reactivity was assessed during a mental arithmetic task and a video game task. Highly fit Ss showed a significantly smaller increase in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR) and reported themselves to be less anxious and less angry than did less fit Ss. Controlling for Ss' scores on a scale assessing angry temperament reduced the relationship between AF and DBP reactivity to nonsignificant levels. Degree of dispositional anger, which covaries with increased fitness, may contribute to the relationship between AF and DBP, but not HR, reactivity.

AB  - Examined relationships between the expressive and neurotic hostility components of the Buss-Durkee Hostility-Guilt Inventory and cardiovascular (CV) reactivity in 25 men and 18 women undergraduates. Ss competed against and were harassed by a male confederate during competition on a video game. Ss with expressive hostility scores above the median had higher systolic BP and heart rate reactivity than Ss with scores below the median. Neurotic hostility was not related to CV reactivity. Results support the hypothesis that CV reactivity may be a risk factor in the development of coronary heart disease and suggest that attempts to relate dimensions of hostility to CV reactivity may be more successful if dimensions of hostility unrelated to neuroticism are studied.

AB  - Evaluated a newly developed stress task, a social competence interview, and 3 nonsocial tasks (video game, mirror drawing, and mental arithmetic) for ability to predict ambulatory blood pressure (BP) in 237 Black and White adolescents (aged 13–16 yrs). Only the BP response to an interview enhanced prediction of classroom and transition systolic and diastolic pressures in the total sample. Mirror drawing improved prediction of transition systolic BP in the total sample. Racial subgroup analyses revealed that interview data predicted systolic pressure in Whites but predicted diastolic pressure in Blacks, indicating biological differences in BP regulation.

AB  - Examined the influence of trait anxiety on the cardiovascular responses of normotensive offspring of hypertensives and normotensives. 48 men, half of whom were offspring of hypertensives (PH+), were exposed to an extended active coping stressor. This was a 1-hr shock avoidance procedure with avoidance contingent on video-game performance. PH+ Ss who scored high on trait anxiety exhibited greater elevations of heart rate and forearm blood flow, and decreases in forearm vascular resistance than did PH+/low trait anxiety Ss or offspring of normotensives (PH–). Cardiovascular responses of PH+/low trait anxiety Ss did not differ from those of PH– Ss. Results suggest affective factors may moderate cardiovascular responses of indviduals at risk for hypertension. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Compared the Social Competence Interview (SCI), which measures physiological changes elicited by re-experiencing a life situation, to video game, mirror drawing (MD), and mental arithmetic (MA) in 260 Ss (aged 14–15 yrs). Blood pressure (BP) changes during SCI exceeded those during the other tasks, and were unaffected by race or gender. Test–retest correlations over 6 mo in a random subsample of 27 Ss showed that BP reactivity to SCI and other tasks was reproducible. The SCI was rated by Ss as less frustrating or demanding than MD or MA. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Tested an extension of I. Ajzen's (1985) theory of planned behavior that includes an emotional component. Human Ss: 64 normal male and female West German adults (university students). Ss played 2 video games (a speed-oriented and a problem-oriented game) in an achievement-motivation situation. Half of the Ss played easy versions of both games; and the other half played difficult versions. Ss' attitudes toward playing the games, their emotional reactions while playing the games, and their feelings of competence were analyzed in relation to the difficulty levels of the games. In addition, the predictive validity of activity- and security-oriented emotions in the theory of planned behavior was analyzed.

AB  - Examined whether oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production were themselves intimately related, so as to make carbon-dioxide-production measures appropriate in the additional-heart-rate methodology. Data from the study by J. R. Turner et al (see record [rid]1989-21622-001[/rid]) were reexamined. Additional heart rates during mental arithmetic and a video game were separately calculated for 24 healthy young men by first using oxygen consumption and then by using carbon dioxide production. The values obtained were highly correlated, and the coefficients for the task periods themselves were 0.99 and 0.96, respectively. Use of carbon-dioxide-production data in this manner would, therefore, seem to be appropriate. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

Results support the hypothesis that individual differences in HR responses to lab tasks reflect similar differences in HR responses and variability during daily life. Results are compared in their degree of support for 2 theoretical models by S. B. Manuck and D. S. Krantz (1984) describing the generalization of individual differences in lab reactivity to reactivity during daily life. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Developed a training protocol to investigate the effect of contingent reinforcement in reducing heart rate (HR) response to stress in 48 healthy male adults. Ss were given both HR feedback (FB) and a behavioral stressor, a computerized videogame. The videogame was used during assessment and training, and a mental arithmetic challenge was given only during the pre- and posttraining assessment. Ss were divided into training groups that (1) received FB/no-FB while playing the videogame and (2) played the videogame either with a combined reinforcement score contingency or with reinforcement based solely on game performance. Results confirm that regulation of HR response during behavioral challenges could be readily learned. There was an absence of any observable HR change for any experimental group across training trials. Ss trained using the combined score contingency showed greater reductions in HR response to the mental arithmetic challenge. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Reports an error in 'A multi-component social skills intervention for children with Asperger syndrome: The Junior Detective Training Program' by Renae Beaumont and Kate Sofronoff (Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 2008[Jul], Vol 49[7], 743-753). The following errors occurred in the article: On Page 743, line 9: (ASDs) has been published incorrectly as (Asbs). On Page 744, line 32: 'hypotheses' has been published incorrectly has 'hypothesis'. In line 52: 'skill generalization' has been published incorrectly as 'skills generalization'. On Page 752, line 44: Appendix A: Session 6, Teacher handout recommendations: 'pro-social' has been published incorrectly as 'pre-social'. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2008-08376-008[/rid]). Background: The study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a new multi-component social skills intervention for children with Asperger syndrome (AS): The Junior Detective Training Program. This 7-week program included a computer game, small group sessions, parent training sessions and teacher handouts. Method: Forty-nine children with AS were recruited to participate and randomly assigned to intervention (n = 26) or wait-list control (n = 23) conditions. Results: Relative to children in the waitlist group, program participants showed greater improvements in social skills over the course of the intervention, as indicated by parent-report measures. Teacher-report data also confirmed that children receiving the intervention made significant improvements in social functioning from pre- to posttreatment. Treatment group participants were better able to suggest appropriate emotion-management strategies for story characters at post-intervention than at pre-intervention, whereas control participants were not. However, there was no difference in the improvements made by children in the intervention and control conditions on facial expression and body-posture recognition measures. Follow-up data suggested that treatment gains were maintained by children at 5-months post-intervention. Conclusions: The Junior Detective Training Program appeared to be effective in enhancing the social skills and emotional understanding of children with AS. Limitations and suggestions for future research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Heart rate (HR) reactions to 2 behavioral stressors (videogame [VG] and mental arithmetic [MAR]) were measured in 8 experimental (EXP) Ss who received biofeedback training and 8 matched control Ss (all Ss aged 18–24 yrs) during 3 assessment periods: pretraining, posttraining, and 1-wk follow-up. EXP Ss exhibited significant reductions in HR following a training session in which they received ongoing HR feedback while playing a VG. Controls, who played the same number of VGs without HR feedback, showed smaller HR reductions. Compared with controls, EXP Ss maintained lower HRs during VG presentations after a 1-wk period and generalized these HR reductions to the MAR challenge at follow-up.

AB  - 69 university students classified as Type A or not-A by structured interview performed physical exercise, a vigilance task, and a videogame with or without challenging instructions. For the (effort-salient) exercise, instructions produced a mean increase in arousal regardless of behavior pattern, while in the vigilance (low salience) task they produced no effect. Only in the videogame task did behavior pattern classification predict arousal in interaction with instructions. Effort, measured by performance, showed a trend to increase with challenging instructions. Ratings by Ss of physical feelings paralleled these results, but positive, negative, and emotional feelings did not show behavior pattern or instruction effects. Results support Type A as a generally available response to which individuals show a differential activation rather than a character trait.

AB  - Monitored heart rate (HR), respiration, and metabolic activity at rest and during a video game in 22 mild hypertensive (MHT) and 53 normotensive (NT) men. The MHT Ss had higher resting HRs than the NT Ss and larger magnitude HR increases to the video game. Correlational analyses within each group revealed that whereas systolic blood pressure was positively and significantly related to neuroticism (Eysenck Personality Questionnaire) in the MHT Ss, for the NT Ss the direction of correlation was reversed. Scores on the Jenkins Activity Survey correlated positively with HR reactivity to the video game for the MHT Ss. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Monitored heart rate plus various ventilatory and metabolic indices while 24 18–28 yr old males played a computer game (Space Invaders) and during a control condition in which analogous but ineffective actions were requested and the game proceeded automatically. Relative to baseline, Ss showed much larger increases in heart rate during the game than during the control condition. O₂ consumption, CO₂ production, and respiratory rate and volume also increased more. While the absolute magnitude of metabolic differences between conditions was modest relative to heart rate differences, the existence of highly significant differences in O₂ consumption and CO₂ production militated against assertions of overall cardiac-metabolic independence during the game; however, analysis of individual differences in heart rate reactivity provided some evidence of metabolically unjustified heart rate changes while playing the game.

AB  - 24 healthy male undergraduates participated in both 1-hr shock avoidance and separate counterbalanced baseline sessions. The S could avoid mild electric shocks depending on video game performance. The primary dependent measures were heart rate (HR), digital blood volume pulse (DBVP), and blood pressure (BP). Most Ss exhibited immediate pronounced increases in HR in response to the stressor, followed by some habituation. DBVP responses did not usually habituate. BP was more or less constantly elevated by the stressor. Individual differences in mean arterial BP response to the stressor were significantly related to individual differences in HR response to the 1st 15 min but increasingly unrelated to HR response and more related to DBVP response as the session progressed.

AB  - Conducted 3 experiments that examined the temporal stability of cardiac reactions to a videogame of the 'space invaders' genre. In Exp I, intertask consistency was also addressed. Along with the videogame, 42 male Ss (mostly undergraduates) were presented with an unsignalled RT task and led to believe that relatively quick reactions attracted financial reward, while slower ones brought either a burst of loud noise or withdrawal of money previously earned. Findings indicate that, of the 2 tasks, the videogame elicited the greater reactivity, and individual variations in reactivity showed striking temporal stability for both tasks. In Exp II, 3 extreme-high and 3 extreme-low cardiac reactors were selected from an initial sample of 23 male undergraduates on the basis of reactivity during an initial session with the videogame and subsequently studied during 4 further sessions. Once more, impressive stability of heart-rate reactivity was apparent over sessions. In Exp III, whether temporal stability is constrained by menstrual-cycle effects was investigated. 12 females aged 17 yrs and 12 females aged 24–38 yrs were tested on the videogame both preovulatory and postovulatory, with half being tested first during the preovulatory phase and half being tested first during the postovulatory phase. Results again reveal a marked stability of individual variations in cardiac reactivity over both time and menstrual cycle phase. (24 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - 20 healthy undergraduates played a video game with and without threat of shock for inferior performance. Results suggest that cardiac parasympathetic activity was diminished from rest to task, contributing to heart rate (HR) responses. Exaggerated HR responses were also associated with extreme parasympathetic withdrawal. Interaction effects showed that threat of shock during the 1st task condition was effective in elevating HR and reducing respiratory stress arrhythmia. A repeated-measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) of HR suggested that sympathetic influences on HR exceeded reciprocal vagal effects during the threat condition for Ss exposed to the threat task first. Findings indicate the importance of considering stress-related parasympathetic effects on HR as well as sympathetic-vagal interactions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Used an interactive adventure-type computer game to explore the constructive components of emotional experience, sympathetic nervous system arousal, and evaluative cognitions postulated by discrepancy/evaluation theory (G. Mandler; 1975, 1984, 1990). Ss were 12 undergraduates whose heart rate, galvanic skin response, and respiration were recorded continuously during each game in 20-sec sets. Subjective ratings of mood intensity were also collected. Manipulations of expectations produced significant and large heart rate changes for both positive and negative discrepancies. Autonomic response also reflected the degree of interruption/discrepancy produced by an event. Negatively toned (discrepant) events produced significant intensity and higher overall autonomic arousal. In addition, Ss' intensity of experience was related to their autonomic response.

AB  - Examined the reliability and validity of recordings from 3 portable blood pressure/pulse units compared with simultaneous recordings from a polygraph used as the standard for these comparisons. 30 healthy Ss (aged 14–65 yrs) were exposed to Pac-Man video game and mental arithmetic stressors. The blood pressure/pulse readings from the digital units by Sears and Industrial Biomedical Sensor corresponded more closely to simultaneous polygraph recordings than did the analog scale device by Sphygmostat. Results suggest that the digital blood pressure/pulse units employed in this investigation are reliable and valid measurement devices suitable for field research with clinical populations.

AB  - The cardiac reactivity of 40 monozygotic and 40 dizygotic pairs of young male twins, aged 16–24 yrs, was monitored during psychological challenge, as afforded by a video game. A simple genetic model that implicated additive genetic effects, along with those stemming from individual environments, best fitted the data. Data suggest individual differences in cardiac reactivity have a heritable component and that high reactivity may be a precursor of elevated blood pressure.

AB  - Examined psychophysiologic reactions to behavioral challenges in 36 men aged 55 or younger with no prior history of cardiovascular disorder. Three age-matched groups were recruited through factory screening: mild hypertensives, transient hypertensives, and normotensives. Clinical examination, a laboratory rest session, and period of blood pressure self-monitoring were followed by a laboratory stress session. The latter involved performance of 2 tasks demanding active behavioral coping (an interference task and video game) and 1 passive condition (a distressing movie). Mild hypertensives showed significantly greater pressor reactions (both in absolute and percentage terms) than normotensives to tasks requiring active behavioral coping, but not to the passive condition. The transient hypertension group produced heightened reactions in diastolic but not systolic pressure. Greater heart rate and pulse transit time reactions were also observed in the transient group, suggesting that exaggerated cardiac responsiveness to active challenges may be characteristic of the prehypertensive profile.

AB  - Presents normative percentile data on the hemodynamic responses (heart rate and blood pressure) of 310 healthy Black and White children (aged 6–18 yrs) to the stress of a TV video game. A series of 3 video games played under 3 increasing levels of stress elicited progressively higher values of blood pressure and heart rate. Both Ss' race and gender, as well as the experimenter's race, significantly affected reactivity. Ss demonstrated a range of interchild reactivity, allowing separation of individuals into high- and low-risk percentile groups. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Reports an error in the original article by D. B. Bugental et al (Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 1993, Vol 64[1], 94–203). On page 97, the sentence 'SCL was measured by bipolar silver-silver chloride electrodes placed on the thumb of the nonpreferred hand' should read as follows: 'SCL was measured by bipolar silver-silver chloride electrodes placed on the thenar and hypothenar eminences of the nonpreferred hand.' (The following abstract of this article originally appeared in record [rid]1993-21385-001[/rid].) Autonomic and affective responses to children were assessed as a function of adult perceptions of interpersonal control. Women (N = 160) interacted with and provided feedback to computer-simulated children who behaved responsively or unresponsively on a computer game. Women were categorized as low in perceived control (PC) if they attributed high control to children but low control to self over negative events on the Parent Attribution Test. As predicted, low-PC women were maximally reactive to child characteristics, manifesting peak levels of defensive arousal (increased level of heart rate and electrodermal activity) and negative affect with unresponsive children and minimal levels of arousal and negative affect with responsive children … (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - 14 healthy Ss (mean age 27 yrs) were simultaneously infused iv with tracer-labeled norepinephrine (NE) and isoproterenol to measure forearm and total body NE pharmacokinetics at rest and in response to mental challenge (video game or cognitive task). Mental challenge was associated with increased heart rate, systolic blood pressure, cardiac output, forearm blood flow, and the rate of release of endogenous NE into arterial blood. Results indicate that mental challenge is associated with generally increased sympathetically-mediated NE release that determines the hemodynamic responses. Because of regional changes in sympathetic activity and blood flow during psychological stress, changes in antecubital venous NE and even arterial NE may not reflect accurately sympathetic nerve activity. However, measurement of total body and regional NE pharmacokinetics avoids these difficulties. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Comments on an article by P.J. Standen and D.J. Brown (see record [rid]2005-06838-025[/rid]). The authors have summarized major advantages of VR systems for people with impairments in cognition and in social functioning. I would like to draw attention to one additional positive feature of VR, namely its close relationship to everyday technologies. Thus, VR users can perceive themselves to be on a continuum with society at large, where computer usage is a potent symbol of social participation. The authors make a very convincing case for the use of virtual environments in the assessment and facilitation of autonomous action. It is hard to think of any paradigm that could rival VR as a means of assessing and encouraging decision-making. The commercial development of environments and 'intelligent agents' for computer games, in-car computers, and so on means that the costs of hardware will fall, and the sophistication of software will rise. In the future, we can surely expect progressively more visual realism, with, let us hope, cheaper ways of constructing virtual copies of real environments. The extension of VR to social interaction seems to have great potential, and this will continue to increase in line with technical developments. In the meantime, it is reassuring to read that there might be benefits for all of us in playing computer games. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Recorded heart rate (HR), oxygen consumption (OC), and blood pressure while 22 males performed a stressful mental arithmetic task and played a video game. Measurements were also made while Ss undertook 2 separate graded dynamic exercise tasks. All measures changed as a function of psychological challenge; and during exercise, HR and OC changed as a function of workload. For each S, HR was plotted against OC over the various workloads for each exercise task separately. Actual HR during psychological challenge was greater than predicted HR (there was considerable additional HR), irrespective of whether upper or lower body exercise was involved.

AB  - Arterial pulse transit time (PTT), EKG-initiated transit time (EKG-TT), and interbeat interval were recorded during a differential classical conditioning procedure with a commercial video game functioning as the UCS in 2 experiments with 18 university students. In Exp I, 10 Ss were presented with 20 acquisition trials. Both PTT and EKG-TT showed differential changes to the CS+ and CS–. The PTT CR took the form of a decrease in transit time, reaching maximum between 5 and 7 beats after CS onset, and the EKG-TT response was biphasic, consisting of an initial lengthening from baseline during the 1st 3 beats after CS onset followed by a decrease below baseline, reaching maximum at Beats 8–20. Exp II was a replication of Exp I: Eight Ss received 40 acquisition trials. PTT and EKG-TT CRs were similar to those observed in Exp I and persisted during the 40 trials. The PTT decrease from baseline during Beats 5–7 was significant, as were the deceleratory and acceleratory EKG-TT components. The cardiovascular CRs occurring prior to the video game appeared to be similar to the preparatory cardiovascular responses observed during the foreperiod of an RT task.

AB  - Reports an error in the original article by Pierre-Yves Oudeyer (International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, 2003[Jul], Vol 59[1-2], 157-183). The name of the author has not been given correctly in the published paper. The author's correct name is Pierre-Yves Oudeyer. (The following abstract of this article originally appeared in record [rid]2003-06408-009[/rid].) This paper presents algorithms that allow a robot to express its emotions by modulating the intonation of its voice. They are very simple and efficiently provide life-like speech thanks to the use of concatenative speech synthesis. We describe a technique which allows to continuously control both the age of a synthetic voice and the quantity of emotions that are expressed. Also, we present the first large-scale data mining experiment about the automatic recognition of basic emotions in informal everyday short utterances. We focus on the speaker-dependent problem. We compare a large set of machine learning algorithms, ranging from neural networks, Support Vector Machines or decision trees, together with 200 features, using a large database of several thousands examples. We show that the difference of performance among learning schemes can be substantial, and that some features which were previously unexplored are of crucial importance. An optimal feature set is derived through the use of a genetic algorithm. We explain how this study can be applied to real world situations in which very few examples are available. Furthermore, we describe a game to play with a personal robot which facilitates teaching of examples of emotional utterances in a natural and unconstrained manner.

AB  - Discusses a program of experiments (e.g., J. R. Turner and D. Carroll; see record [rid]1986-13875-001[/rid]) that examined heart rate (HR) responses to mental arithmetic and a video game. The metabolic relevance of HR responses was emphasized. Comparison with HR/oxygen consumption regression equations generated from isotonic exercise data revealed HR increases in certain individuals in excess of those necessitated by contemporary metabolic demand. Evidence was obtained to support both temporal and intertask consistency of reaction. The relationship between laboratory and real-world reactions was investigated, and preliminary evidence suggests that laboratory HR responses are indicative of responses to more naturalistic stressors. Twin studies that examined genetic and environmental determinants of individual differences in HR change during the tasks revealed a substantial genetic component for these responses.

AB  - Heart rate (HR) was monitored while 22 pairs of male monozygotic and 29 pairs of male dizygotic twins (aged 16–26 yrs) were exposed to a video game and a mental arithmetic task. HR reactions of monozygotic Ss showed much greater concordance than those of dizygotic Ss. Data for the 102 Ss demonstrated reliable intertask consistency of HR. Comparison of HR reactions of 10 of the pairs of monozygotic and 10 of the pairs of dizygotic Ss who had been tested more than a year earlier and their present reactivities revealed temporal consistency.

AB  - Examined whether both stress and smoking produce larger cardiovascular consequences than either factor alone. Stress was defined as playing a series of difficult video games under challenging instructional conditions. Following an initial test game, 51 male college student smokers were randomly assigned to a 2 (smoke vs sham smoke) × 2 (stress vs no stress) design. Ss assigned to the sham smoke condition (inhaling unlit cigarettes) under no stress evidenced minimal changes in cardiovascular parameters. Ss who smoked under no stress evidenced approximately 12 mmHg increases in systolic blood pressure, 9 mmHg increases in diastolic blood pressure, and a 15 beat/min increase in heart rate. These effects were similar in magnitude to those seen in Ss assigned to the sham smoke condition under stress. By contrast, Ss who smoked under stress showed markedly larger increases in all cardiovascular parameters, approximately doubling the magnitude of the observed response over that seen with either smoking or stress alone. Correlational analyses suggest the presence of stable individual differences in autonomic lability or sensitivity. Results also suggest that smoking mildly impaired psychomotor performance. Possible mechanisms are suggested whereby stress and smoking may combine to heighten the risk for coronary disease. (34 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Investigated the effects of 4 levels of information load on performance, risk taking, and physiological responsivity (blood pressure and heart rate). 25 23–71 yr old males participated in a hand-eye coordination task presented as a video game. Increases in load resulted in performance decrements and increased proclivity to take risks. Participation in the task increased diastolic arousal. Load effects on arousal were negligible. Ss with greater diastolic blood pressure elevations engaged in more risk taking. The potential of 2 separate groupings of stressor effects, directly producing cognitive performance changes in one case and producing affective/arousal impacts in the other (with potential indirect effects on cognition and performance), is considered.

AB  - Studied the effects of psychological stimuli (playing a video game) and physical stimuli (sitting and standing) on cardiovascular and catecholamine changes before and after physical training in 8 labile hypertensive men (mean age 30 yrs). Ss underwent a 20-wk training program consisting of 3 45-min jogging sessions per week. The results show that plasma norepinephrine concentration rose with sitting and standing but plasma epinephrine concentration increased only with the psychological stimulus. Physical training was associated with smaller increases in blood pressure during psychological and physical stimuli and with a lower heart rate at rest. Plasma catecholamines at rest as well as in response to the different stimuli were unchanged following moderate training. These observations suggest that the adrenal medulla is selectively activated during a period of mild psychological stress, while the activity of the sympathetic fibers is preferentially increased during mild physical stimuli. Furthermore, the results show that plasma catecholamine levels at rest and their increase during various stimuli are unchanged following training.

AB  - Recorded heart rate (HR), oxygen consumption (VO₂), and blood pressure while 24 18–35 yr old males performed 2 active psychological tasks (mental arithmetic and a video game). Using data obtained during graded dynamic exercise, Ss were also divided into high fit (HF) and low fit (LF) groups. Findings indicate that both psychological tasks increased HR more than was predicted based on HR-VO₂ regressions derived from graded exercise. HR increases during psychological challenge were significantly greater in LF Ss than in HF Ss. Results suggest that greater aerobic fitness may be associated with attenuation of excessive cardiac responses to behavioral stressors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Investigated the relationships among a personality variable (verbalizing/visualizing), type of game (verbal/visual), performance (success/failure), perceptions (complexity), and emotions (pleasure, arousal, and dominance) in a playful consumption experience. 60 graduates students (mean age 25.6 yrs) were given either a verbal or a visual version of a video game that was to be played on a home computer. Ss were asked to complete measures of performance, tendencies toward visualization/verbalization, emotions, and perceived complexity. Results suggest that performance, perceived complexity, and personality–game congruity determine emotional responses and that performance itself depends both on previous performance and on various ability-related individual characteristics. Although still tentative, such findings indicate an important role for the competence motive in the enjoyment of games. (61 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Cardiovascular and hormonal responses to a structured interview, an electronic video game, a cold pressor test, and exercise on a bicycle ergometer were assessed in 83 normotensive Black and White men and women (aged 25–44 yrs). Black Ss showed significantly greater diastolic blood pressure (DBP) responses than White Ss during the cold pressor test, which were not accounted for by an increase in plasma catecholamines. Exercise produced reliably greater systolic blood pressure (SBP) increases in Black women than in Black men or White women. Men showed significantly greater SBP and DBP changes than women during the video game. The pattern of physiological reactivity elicited by challenge may be related to the Ss' race and sex.

AB  - 16 women attending a premenstrual tension clinic and 8 control women were tested in the pre- and postmenstrual phases with measures of heart rate (HR), skin conductance (SCO), and neck electromyogram (EMG). Measures were taken during rest, relaxation, an emotionally upsetting film, and performance of mental arithmetic and video game tasks. During relaxation, SCO level decreased to a greater extent in the premenstrual than in the postmenstrual phase, while EMG showed the reverse pattern. HR reactions to the mental and video game tasks were smaller in the premenstrual than in the postmenstrual phase for controls and for clinic attenders who showed only modest changes in symptom severity across the cycle, but not in attenders who showed marked premenstrual symptom increases.

AB  - Two studies were conducted to investigate the use of cognitive/attentional distraction (via commercially available video games) to control conditioned nausea in pediatric cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. The first study compared the nausea severity in children who played video games during chemotherapy-related procedures with that of control-group children who did not play video games. The second study used a combined ABAB withdrawal and repeated measures analysis of variance design that incorporated baseline and intervention assessments within a single session. In both studies, video game-playing resulted in significantly less nausea. The introduction and withdrawal of the opportunity to play video games produced significant changes (reduction and exacerbation, respectively) in nausea. Although video games also reduced self-reported anxiety, the effects were weaker than those for nausea. Pulse rate and systolic/diastolic blood pressure were not consistently affected.

AB  - In Exp I, 18 8th-grade girls who had been in a study of the familial aggregation of cardiovascular responses to behavioral stress repeated the assessment protocol in the 9th grade. Results show that task-induced increases in diastolic blood pressure and heart rate during serial subtraction, mirror image tracing, and isometric handgrip tasks were reliable across test sessions. In Exp II, 18 5th-grade boys who had been in a previous experiment of cardiovascular responses during a videogame were tested in the 9th grade in the protocol used in Exp I. Results show that task-induced increases in diastolic blood pressure and heart rate during video games were related to task-induced increases during the other tasks over 3 yrs later.

AB  - Observed 72 undergraduates selected for possession of either the Type A (coronary-prone) or Type B (coronary-resistant) behavior pattern as they interacted with a computer, while appearing to interact with a partner, in a formal competitive game of social strategy. Type A Ss exhibited greater impatience than Type B Ss. Computer analysis of the EKG revealed that social stimulation elicited larger ventricular electrophysiological responses (ST segment depression and reduction of T and R wave amplitudes) in Type A than in Type B Ss. Such changes are consistent with the assumption of greater cardiac sympathetic activity during the social interactions in the Type A Ss.

AB  - 16 male and 16 female undergraduates played a mixed-motive game against a male confederate under either a 20 or an 80% cooperative strategy while cardiovascular responses were computer monitored. Females had larger heart rate responses than males during play under the competitive strategy, and the opposite was true during play under the cooperative strategy. Ss who were more competitive during the game, who scored higher on a coronary-prone (Type A) behavior scale, or who reported having an action orientation toward life stress tended to have larger heart rate responses during the game than did the remaining Ss. Results draw attention to the importance of covert autonomic responses for understanding overt behavioral choices in mixed-motive games and to the potential utility of this behavioral model for studying the role of psychosocial factors in psychosomatic illnesses.

AB  - Exposed 32 male undergraduates to a 1-hr shock avoidance procedure, with avoidance contingent on video game performance. Relationships among individual differences in heart rate (HR), forearm blood flow, forearm vascular resistance, and digital blood volume pulse responses were examined. Decreases in forearm vascular resistance were observed only among Ss with high and medium HR reactivity. As the session progressed, however, forearm vascular resistance responses of the medium HR reactors were sustained; those of high HR reactors habituated despite the fact that HR and forearm blood flow responses remained elevated. Implications of these results for an autoregulation theory of hypertension development are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Developed a microcomputer automated system for measuring systolic time intervals, using 38 male college students. Ss' EKG, phonocardiogram, and carotid pulse tracings were measured during baseline conditions and during either exercise on a bicycle ergometer or a video-game task. These measurements were recorded on both a traditional 3-channel EKG recorder and the computerized system. Both methods of recording systolic time intervals were independently scored by 2 different experimenters in order to assess interrater reliability of hand-scoring, intermethod reliability between hand-scoring vs computer-scoring, and interrater reliability of computer-scoring. Data indicate that the computerized method of scoring systolic time intervals was as reliable as the more traditional scoring of paper tracing.

AB  - Assessed systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate (HR) during conditions of competition alone or in conjunction with goal blocking or harassment in 60 male undergraduates. Cardiovascular reactivity was examined as a function of conditions, Type A (coronary prone) or Type B (noncoronary prone) patterns, and various measures of anger/hostility. Ss completed the Jenkins Activity Survey—Form T before receiving the Type A structured interview; 2–5 wks later, Ss played a video game under conditions of competition control, goal blocking, or harassment. Harassment elicited significantly elevated SBP and HR changes relative to goal-blocking and control conditions. Type A's reliably exceeded Type B's in magnitude of SBP change during the harassment condition only. However, analyses correlating anger/hostility measures and cardiovascular reactivity indicated that only Ss scoring high on the Buss-Durkee Hostility-Guilt Inventory showed significantly elevated SBP reactivity as a function of Type A behavior pattern, rated hostility during the A-B interview, or outward expression of anger assessed by the Framingham Anger-In vs Anger-Out Scale.

AB  - 40 undergraduates classified as either coronary-prone (Type A) or coronary-resistant (Type B) interacted in a mixed-motive game in pairs by pressing buttons that transmitted messages through a TV screen while an EKG and digital blood volume pulse were computer monitored. Ss were classified by scores on the Jenkins Activity Survey. Ss could cooperate, compete, punish, reward, or withdraw during each interaction and could send 1 of 55 messages communicating feelings, requests, and intentions between interactions. Paired Type A's interacted more competitively and aggressively than paired Type B's. There were no significant differences between Type A's and Type B's in heart rate or digital vasomotor response during the interpersonal game. The behavioral results confirm findings from an earlier experiment by the 1st author (see record [rid]1980-22844-001[/rid]). (11 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Used a 2 × 2 (smoke/no smoke × stress/no stress) factorial design to evaluate the impact of stress and smoking on the cardiovascular responses of 43 female undergraduates and college staff (mean age 20.7 yrs). The stressor was a video game. Results reveal that the combination of stress and cigarette smoking produced blood pressure and heart rate responses that were larger than the additive effects of smoking and stress taken separately.

AB  - Studied the relationship among personality factors, heart rate, and aggression after having played an aggressive video game in 28 male and 28 female 8th graders. It was found that for males, personality traits and heart rate were separately related to aggression. Personality characteristics similar to those of the Type A individual were related in a positive direction to heart rate in females. The content of the video games did not affect heart rate or postgame aggression, even though females displayed greater mean heart rate than males throughout the experiment. Results are discussed with regard to sex role stereotypes, content-related explanations of aggression, and Type A personality characteristics.

AB  - Autonomic and electrocortical activity were recorded while 39 prison inmates (mean age 28.8 yrs) with high (Group H) and low (Group L) ratings of psychopathy were presented with a series of binaural tone pips, either by themselves (passive attention) or while video games were being played (selective attention). During selective attention, Ss were told that the tone pips were irrelevant to the primary task, the video games. The N100 component of the auditory EP was used as an index of attention paid to the tone pips, while performance on the video games was considered to be a reflection of attentiveness to the primary task. There were no group differences in N100 amplitude or latency during passive attention, supporting results from several previous studies. During selective attention Group H gave small N100 responses to the tone pips during each video game trial, including the first one, while Group L gave large N100 responses to the tone pips during the 1st trial, and small responses during later trials. Both groups performed equally well during the first few trials, but while the performance of Group L continued to improve, that of Group H deteriorated over the last few trials. Results are interpreted in terms of limited capacity models of attention and provide some support for the hypothesis that psychopaths allocate a relatively large proportion of their attentional resources to things of immediate interest, effectively ignoring other stimuli.

AB  - Compared cardiovascular reactivity to video game and mental arithmetic stressors among 3 groups of men (aged 21–63 yrs): (a) 11 aerobically trained mild hypertensives, (b) 7 untrained mild hypertensives, and (c) 9 untrained normotensives. Blood pressure (BP) reactivity of normotensives during the video game was generally similar to that of trained hypertensives but smaller than that of untrained hypertensives. There were no group differences in reactivity during mental arithmetic. Results indicate that aerobic training, which has been found to reduce resting BP in mild hypertensives, may also exert a favorable impact in reducing cardiovascular reactivity of hypertensives during some stressful situations.

AB  - Used 3 independent dimensions of pleasure–displeasure, arousal–nonarousal, and dominance–submissiveness to assess emotional impacts of individual videogames and constructed a preference measure to evaluate attraction toward vs avoidance of specific games. In Study 1, 38 male and 20 female undergraduates rated the emotional impacts of 22 common arcade videogames, and 35 male and 18 female undergraduates rated their preferences for the same games. Findings indicate that the emotional impact of videogames was highly unpleasant, moderately arousing, and moderately dominance-inducing; thus, the predominant emotional response to these games was aggression, anger, or hostility. In Study 2, 69 male and 31 female patrons (mean age 18 yrs) of a university videogame arcade were recruited and assigned to play 2 games each and to report their reactions to each game immediately after playing. Results show that greater feelings of pleasure, and separately of arousal, while playing videogames resulted in higher preferences for the games and that greater dominance (significant only for males) also led to higher preferences. Implications for designs of home computer games or computer-based training and educational programs are discussed, and it is suggested that combinations of pleasant, arousing, and dominance-inducing features can enhance the attractiveness of games and programs to players and learners, respectively.

AB  - Reviews the literature on the cardiovascular effects of smoking and psychological stress in the light of epidemiological data and discusses mechanisms by which they may contribute to coronary heart disease. The integrated results of the studies suggest that psychological stressors (e.g., video games or mental arithmetic) can enhance adrenergic activity and sympathetic tone, setting into motion widespread physiological and biochemical perturbations. The use of nicotine in response to stress may exacerbate the potentially detrimental health consequences associated with chronic or excessive stimulation of the adrenomedullary system, particularly in susceptible or hyperreactive persons.

AB  - Presents an overview of a theory of automated adversarial planning, derived from the enhancement and expansion of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques from the areas of automated planning and knowledge-based computer game playing. ARES (adversarial reasoning system), a computer program that can plan sequences of robot actions and compete in game environments, where adversities (including intelligent adversarial counterplanners) exist is discussed. It is suggested that AI planners have the potential for autonomously solving low-level planning problems such as those found in robotics applications and can form the basis of expert consultation systems for higher levels military planning problems involving command and control.

AB  - Examined event-related potentials in 20 right-handed patients with chronic depression (aged 18–46 yrs) in response to emotional stimuli. Ss experienced a positive emotional stimulus (winning a serve in a video tennis game) or a negative stimulus (losing a serve). Cortical potentials were found to have specific features associated with positive and negative emotions. Findings suggest that, in chronic depression, the topography of cortical processes associated with emotional stimuli is impaired. This was reflected in the absence of any clear hemispheric dominance in the organization of emotional responses. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Investigated the personality, maturity, and underachievement of 14-yr-old college early entrance program students, using data on 12 undergraduates who had participated in an early entrance program and had earned grade point averages (GPAs) of less than 3.0, compared with 44 who had earned GPA's of 3.0 or above. Underachieving males (UAMs) appeared less psychologically mature and to suffer more internal conflict than achieving males, but underachieving females (UAFs) evidenced greater maturity than their counterparts. Asians had high average performance, reflecting an ethnic difference. Lower grades seemed to attend students, particularly males who were more adolescent than academic and females with absorbing extracurricular commitments. UAMs tended to be lost in juvenile fantasy and computer games or tangled in identity confusion and familial struggles for personal autonomy, whereas UAFs tended to be committed to varsity sports, precociously self-supporting, or physically unwell.

AB  - Conducted 2 exploratory studies using a total of 15 undergraduate and 20 graduate students as Ss to investigate the process involved in a longitudinal decision-making (DM) task characterized by high S involvement, multiple interdependent decisions, and a changing decision environment. The longitudinal relationships between the DM processes that Ss used in the task and their task performance were also investigated. A computer-simulated, strategy-formulation game and simultaneous verbal protocols were used. It was found that a number of information-processing and information-evaluation thought processes were significantly related to game performance. Consistent with what is known about individual DM, the present results suggest that, for the task used in this study, individuals who engage in causal analysis perform better than those who did not. But those who focus on negative emotions, blindly repeat previously successful decisions, and engage in illogical thought processes perform more poorly than those who do not.

AB  - Investigated the reduction of cardiovascular responses to a videogame (VG) challenge, using heart rate (HR) feedback, in 20 undergraduate males. Ss received either (1) training with HR feedback (plus a score contingency in which VG performance was partly dependent on changes in HR) during VG presentations or (2) no feedback training during presentation of the same number of VGs. Ss receiving training exhibited lower HR responses and poorer VG performance during a posttraining assessment than no-feedback controls. Results support the hypothesis that HR feedback, combined with the score contingency and administered during a challenging VG, can be used to significantly reduce HR responsivity to that same challenge when presented without feedback.

AB  - Compared male and female behavior in response to various forms of threats previously found to elicit different perceptual and behavioral reactions. 41 undergraduates played a fairly complex decision-making internation simulation game in a computer-controlled laboratory. Results indicate that deterrent threats were somewhat more likely to result in compliance than compellent threats. Although there were no gross differences between male and female response patterns, males were somewhat more likely to comply to a threat. Of the noncompliers, males were more likely to behave aggressively and attack the other. Evidence is presented which indicates that females respond to an emotion-evoking hostile situation by passively resisting or withdrawing. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Investigated heart rate (HR) acceleration and its relationship to serum cholesterol, triglycerides, and blood pressure reactivity in 59 White males (aged 28–69 yrs) with unmedicated mild hypertension. Ss' cardiovascular responses were monitored during the Stroop Color and Word Test and the Pac Man videogame. High HR accelerators manifested greater systolic and diastolic blood pressure responses during behavioral challenge and higher levels of serum cholesterol and triglycerides than low HR accelerators. Findings suggest that HR acceleration may predict greater risk for stress related atherosclerosis. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Extreme high and low heart rate (HR) reactors were selected from a group of 24 young adults on the basis of responses to 2 laboratory stressors: a video game and a mental arithmetic task. HRs of the Ss were then recorded during a public-speaking competition. HR reactions to this more naturalistic stressor were generally in line with the laboratory-based designations.
